<h2>Mother‚Äôs Agenda</h2>
<h3>1966</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document ‚Äî 6,000 pages in 13 volumes ‚Äî is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death ‚Äî upon the very power that changes death ‚Äî and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1">‚ÄúThe only creation for which there is any place here is the supramental, the bringing of the divine Truth down on the earth, not only into the mind and vital but into the body and into Matter. Our object is not to remove all ‚Äòlimitations‚Äô on the expansion of the ego or to give a free field and make unlimited room for the fulfillment of the ideas of the human mind or the desires of the ego-centred life-force. None of us are here to ‚Äòdo as we like‚Äô, or to create a world in which we shall at last be able to do as we like; we are here to do what the Divine wills and to create a world in which the Divine Will can manifest its truth no longer deformed by human ignorance or perverted and mistranslated by vital desire. The work which the sadhak of the supramental yoga has to do is not his own work for which he can lay down his own conditions, but the work of the Divine which he has to do according to the conditions laid down by the Divine. Our yoga is not for our own sake but for the sake of the Divine. It is not our personal manifestation that we are to seek, the manifestation of the individual ego freed from all bounds and from all bonds, but the manifestation of the Divine. Of that manifestation our own spiritual liberation, perfection, fullness is to be a result and a part, but not in any egoistic sense or for any ego-centred or self-seeking purpose. This liberation, perfection, fullness too must not be pursued for our own sake, but for the sake of the Divine.‚Äù</p>

happy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="6" href="#">6</a>; then he went into his room and after a few minutes, opened the door and called for a doctor, and in no time it was over. That's probably when he called. But it was decided a very long time ago.</p>

<p class="PE">I saw Purani last night. It's the first time I have seen him since he went out of his 
body.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11" href="#">1</a> There were other people too. I saw him in a subtle physical world and he was all light blue and pink, and everything around him was pink and luminous <em>(Mother makes a dancing gesture)</em>. He was pleased, oh, so pleased, he said, ‚ÄúNow I am happy!‚Äù</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-57"><em>Lots of preoccupations?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-58">No! This morning I lived for two hours in a sort of blissful state in which there was, oh, such a clear awareness that all forms of life, in all the worlds and at all times, are the expression of a choice: you choose to be that way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-59">It's very hard to put it into words.... The sort of compulsion in which we think we have to live and to which we think we are subjected had com-plete-ly vanished, and there was a perfectly spontaneous and natural perception that life on earth, life in the other worlds, and all the types of life on earth, and all the types of life in the other worlds, are simply a question of choice: you chose to be that way, and you constantly choose to be this way or that, or choose that this or that is going to happen; and you also choose to think you are subjected to a Fate or a Necessity or a Law that compels you ‚Äì everything is a question of choice. And there was a sense of lightness, of freedom <em>(same dancing gesture)</em>, and then one of those smiles at everything. And at the same time, it gives you a tremendous power. All sense of compulsion, of necessity (and even more of fate) had com-plete-ly vanished. All the illnesses, all the events, all the dramas, all of it ‚Äì vanished. And this concrete and so stark a reality of physical life ‚Äì completely gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-60">The interesting point is that the experience arose from my encounter with Purani last night. I met Purani in a certain world and he was in a certain state, like the one I have just described, but then the difference between Purani as he was here and Purani as he is now... suddenly, it was like a key. I spoke to him, he
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="PE"> spoke to me, saying, ‚ÄúOh, now I am so happy, so happy!‚Äù And it was in that state that I lived this morning for more than an hour and a half. Afterwards, I am obliged to come back... to a state I find artificial, but which can't be helped because of others, the contact with others and things and the innumerable amount of things to be done. But still, the experience remains in the background. And you are left with a sort of amused smile at all the complications of life ‚Äì the state in which people are is the result of a choice, and individually the freedom of choice is there, but they have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FORGOTTEN</span> it. That's what is so interesting!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-61">At the same time, I saw the whole picture of human knowledge (because when those states are present, all human realizations, all human knowledge come like a panorama in front of the new state and are put back in their proper place ‚Äì when an experience comes, it's always, always as though retrospective), and I saw all the theories, all the beliefs, all the philosophical ideas, how they were connected to the new state.... Oh, it was such fun!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-62">And it doesn't require rest; these experiences are so concrete and spontaneous and real (they aren't the result of a will, still less of an effort) that they don't require rest: I was busy washing. I took my whole breakfast in that state, it was charming. It was only when those people came (and I even did the ‚Äúegg distribution‚Äù ‚Äì I don't know if you are aware of it, but I am the one who puts your egg in your box every day ‚Äì I did my egg distribution in that state, I gave the flowers in that state), it was only afterwards, when letters came that I had to listen to and answer and all manner of things <em>(gesture of a truckload being dumped) ‚Äì</em> then it fades away, it gets erased. It still leaves me in a half-dream, but the experience is gone: it's no longer that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-63">But those who got hold of this experience for some reason or other without having all the philosophical and mental preparation I had (the ‚Äúsaints,‚Äù or at any rate all the people who led a spiritual life) had instead a very acute impression of the unreality of life and the illusion of life. But that's only a narrow way of looking at it. That's not it ‚Äì that's not it, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> is a choice! Everything, everything. The Lord's choice, but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN US</span>; not there <em>(gesture above)</em>: here. And we are unaware of it, it's deep down in ourselves. But when we are aware of it, we can choose ‚Äì we can choose our choice, that's wonderful!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-64">For instance, when that state was there, I told my body, ‚ÄúBut see, you clumsy fool, why do you choose to be dramatic? To have pain, to be this and that?...‚Äù And that sort of fate and bond and
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="PE"> hardness of existence ‚Äì all that had vanished. All vanished. It was light blue, light pink, all luminous and clear and... <em>(same dancing gesture)</em>... buoyant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-65">I very well imagine that it's not something absolute; it was only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> way of being, but a charming way of being!... Usually, when those who don't have a sufficient intellectual preparation have an experience like this one, they think they have caught the ‚Äúonly‚Äù truth. And then, from it, they dogmatize. But I clearly saw it wasn't that: it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> way of being, but a wonderful way of being, of course! Infinitely superior to the one we have here. And we <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAN</span> have it here: I had it. I had it quite concretely. And there is always something going wrong (a pain here or a pain there, or this or that, and then circumstances going wrong too, always difficulties)... the color of it all changes. And it becomes buoyant, you know, light ‚Äì light, supple. All the hardness and rigidity ‚Äì gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-66">And the feeling that if you choose to be that way, you can go on being that way. And it's true. It's all the bad habits ‚Äì habits that have been on earth for thousands of years, obviously ‚Äì it's all the bad habits that stop you; but there is no reason why it couldn't be a permanent state. Because it changes everything! Everything changes!... You know, I was brushing my teeth, washing my eyes, doing the most material things: their nature changed! And there was a vibration, a conscious vibration in the eye that was being washed, in the toothbrush, in... All that, all of it was different. And it is clear that if you become the master of that state, you can change all circumstances around you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-67">Recently (for some time), there was that same difficulty of the body, which isn't limited and shut inside a shell as is generally the case, and which freely receives... not even with the feeling of ‚Äúreceiving‚Äù ‚Äì which <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAS</span> the vibrations of everything around it; and then, when everything around it is, mentally or morally, closed, unwilling to understand, it's a bit difficult, which means that the elements that come have to be transformed. It's a sort of totality ‚Äì a very manifold and unsteady totality ‚Äì representing your field of consciousness and action and on which you must work constantly to reestablish a harmony (a minimum of harmony), and when something around you ‚Äúgoes wrong‚Äù according to the ordinary idea, it makes the work a bit difficult. It's subtle, persistent, and obstinate at the same time. I remember, last night when I stretched out on my bed, there was in the body an aspiration for Harmony, for Light, for a sort of smiling peace; the body aspired above all for harmony because of all those things that grate and scrape. And
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="PE"> the experience was probably the result of that aspiration: I went there and met a pink and light-blue Purani (!) ‚Äì what a blue! The pretty, very pretty light blue of Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-68">Only, I have noticed that in this body's life, I've never had the same experience twice ‚Äì I may have the same type of experience to a higher degree or to a much vaster degree, but never identically the same. And I don't retain the experience: I am constantly, constantly <em>(gesture forward)</em>, constantly forging ahead; you know, the work of transformation of the consciousness is so rapid, it must be done so fast that you don't have time to enjoy or dwell upon an experience or draw long-lasting satisfaction from it, it's impossible. It comes powerfully, very powerfully, it changes everything, then something else comes. It's the same thing with the transformation of the cells: all kinds of little disorders come, but to the consciousness they are clearly disorders related to the transformation, so you see to that particular point, you want order to be restored; at the same time, something knows full well that the disorder came to make the transition from the ordinary automatic functioning to the conscious functioning under the direct Direction and the direct Influence of the Supreme. And the body itself knows this (still, it's no fun to have a pain here or a pain there, or this or that being disorganized, but it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOWS</span>). And when that point has reached a certain stage of transformation, you move on to another point, then on to another, and on to another again. So nothing is done, no work is definitively done until... everything is ready. So you have to do the same work again, but on a higher or a vaster level, or with more intensity or in greater detail (it depends on the case), until <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> has been brought to a homogeneous point and is ready in the same way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-69">According to what I see, it's going as fast as it can go. But it takes a great deal of time. And everything is a question of changing the habit. The whole automatic habit of millennia must be changed into a conscious action, directly guided by the supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-70">The tendency is to say that it takes much more time and is more difficult because you are surrounded with people and you act in the world, but if you weren't in those conditions, a lot of things would be overlooked, a lot. A lot of things would remain undone. There are all kinds of vibrations that aren't in affinity with this aggregate [Mother's cellular aggregate] and that would never have had an opportunity to touch the transforming Force if I weren't in contact with all the people.</p>

Your true consciousness, you know, the consciousness of your true being, is in a very rapid ascent; something in you isn't aware of that and lags behind, and that's what causes an unease in you. So it's clear that writing is a good means (probably the best means) of getting rid of it: you throw it outside yourself by expressing it, and then it's finished, you've got rid of it. It's the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FORM</span>, you understand, only the form; it's always the same thing: the essence and spirit, and on the other hand the form. You are rising like an arrow, and you don't know it because something remains like that, hard, tight, and it's only a form. Well, it's better to get rid of it; it's the most natural way for you to exteriorize the form, the state of consciousness and the difficulty, all of it together, at the same time as you write the book.</p>

We are now concerned with one particular form that you had conceived; well, what makes this form useful is that, to me (what I am going to tell you may be a bit commonplace), it can be used as a pickaxe, you understand, to root out the things you want to reject from your consciousness: a certain way of being of your consciousness that's receding into the past.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-183">If we follow to its end the idea with which Sri Aurobindo wrote this, Death would be the principle that created Falsehood in the world.... It's obviously either Falsehood that created Death, or Death that created Falsehood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-184"><em>It's rather Falsehood that created Death!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-185">Logically, yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-186">According to the story (if it can be called a story) that Th√©on told, it was Falsehood that created Death. But according to what we've just read, Death would be what created Falsehood.... Obviously it must be neither this way nor that! It must be something else, which we should find.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-187">Th√©on's idea (which also fits with the teaching here in India in which they say it was the sense of separation that created the whole Disorder ‚Äì Death, Falsehood and all the rest), Th√©on's idea was that those first four Emanations, that is, Consciousness, Love, Life, and Truth (Love was the last, I think, but I no longer remember what he said), those four individual emanated Beings, according to him, in full consciousness of their power and existence, cut themselves off from their Origin. In other words, they wanted to depend only on themselves, they didn't even feel the need to keep the connection
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 44</p>
<p class="PE"> with their Origin (I am putting it very materially). So then, that cut is what instantly caused Consciousness to become Unconsciousness, Love to become Suffering (it wasn't Love ‚Äì it was actually Ananda which became Suffering), Life to become Death and Truth to become Falsehood. And they hurled themselves into the creation like that. Then, there was a second creation, which was the creation of the gods, to mend the mischief caused by those four (the story is told in almost a childlike way in order not to be abstract, in order to become concrete). The gods are the second emanation and they came to mend. In India and everywhere, they were given various names and functions, and they are found in the Overmind region, that is to say, above the physical quaternary, the material quaternary. And the function of those gods is to mend the damage wrought by the others. And the region in which the others (the first Emanations) concentrated is the vital region.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-188">All this can be translated philosophically, intellectually and so on. It is told as a story so that the most physical intellectuality may understand. But in principle, it's the separation from the Origin that created the whole Disorder. And, as far as I know, in India too the Upanishads say the same thing; Sri Aurobindo, at any rate, says that Disorder came with the sense of Separation. So those are different ways of saying the same thing. In one case, seen in a certain way, it's a willed separation; in the other case, it's an inevitable consequence ‚Äì inevitable consequence of... of what? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-189">Because, according to theogonies, the gods have remained in contact with their Origin and they feel themselves to be the representation of the Origin, as in the Indian theogony in which they say that Shiva is the representative of the Supreme ‚Äì Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, Shiva, the transformer ‚Äì and all three are conscious representatives of the Supreme, but partial ones.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-190">It's perfectly obvious that those are only manners of speaking. There are indeed entities, they do exist, but... it's only a way of telling the story; in one way or another, it's the same thing. Metaphysics is also one way of telling the story. And one isn't truer than the other.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-191">But to me, the problem is to find... You know, I am after the process that will lead to the power to undo what was done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-192">When people asked Th√©on, ‚ÄúHow did things come to happen that way?‚Äù (he used to say that the first Emanation and the next
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 45</p>
<p class="PE"> three separated themselves), ‚ÄúWhy did they separate themselves?‚Äù, he would reply very simply <em>(laughing)</em>, ‚ÄúWhy is the world as it is, in this state of disorder? Why is it like that?... That's not the interesting point: the interesting point is to make it what it must be.‚Äù But after all those years, there is something in me that would like to have the power or the key: the process. And is it not necessary to feel or live or see (but ‚Äúsee,‚Äù I mean, see actively) how it went this way <em>(Mother bends her wrist in one direction)</em> in order to be able to go that way <em>(she bends it in the opposite direction)</em>? That's the question.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-193">What's interesting is that now that this mind of the cells has been organized, it appears to be going with dizzying speed through the process of human mental development all over again, in order to reach... the key, precisely. There is of course the sense that the state we are in is a false unreality, but there is a sort of need or aspiration to find, not a mental or moral ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù nothing of the sort, but a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HOW</span> ‚Äì how it got twisted this way <em>(Mother bends her wrist in one direction)</em>, in order to straighten it out <em>(gesture in the opposite direction)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-194">The pure sensation has the experience of the two vibrations [the false and the true, the twisted and the straight vibrations], but the transition from one to the other is still a mystery. It's a mystery, because it cannot be explained: neither when it goes this way <em>(gesture to the false direction)</em> nor when it goes that way <em>(gesture to the true direction)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-195">So there is something that says like Th√©on, ‚ÄúLearn to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BE</span> that way [on the true side] and stay that way.‚Äù But there is an impression that the ‚Äústay that way‚Äù must depend on knowing why one is that way or how one is that way?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-211">Ultimately, with worlds it's the same as with individuals, and with universes the same as with worlds. It's only the duration that differs: an individual is very small, a world is a little bigger, and a universe still bigger! But what begins ends.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-214">But that's quite a human and external way of putting it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-215">I am absolutely conscious of the inadequacy of words, but through the words, we must catch hold of the Thing.... The difficulty for human thought, and still more for expression, is that words always have a sense of beginning.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-216">I had the perception of this manifestation ‚Äì a ‚Äúpulsatory‚Äù manifestation, I might say ‚Äì which opens out, shrivels up, opens out, shrivels up again... and there comes a point when the opening out is such, the fluidity, the plasticity, the capacity for change are such that there is no need anymore to reabsorb in order to shape anew, and there will be a progressive transformation. Th√©on used to say (I think I've already told you about it) that this is the seventh universal creation, that there have been six 
pralayas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">1</a> before and this is the seventh creation, but that it will be possible for this one to be transformed without being reabsorbed ‚Äì which obviously is perfectly unimportant because, the moment you have the eternal consciousness, whether things go this way or that way doesn't matter in the least. It's for the limited human consciousness that there is a sort of ambition or need for something that doesn't end, because, within, there is what we might call ‚Äúthe memory of eternity‚Äù and that memory of eternity aspires for the manifestation to partake of that eternity. But if the sense of eternity is active and present, you don't lament ‚Äì you don't lament if you discard a worn-out garment, do you? (You may be attached, but anyway you don't lament.) It's the same thing: if a universe disappears, it means it has wholly fulfilled its function, it has reached the limit of its possibilities, and another must replace it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-217">I followed the curve. When you are very small in your consciousness and development, you feel a great need for the earth not to disappear, for it to be perpetuated (while being transformed as much as one likes, but always with the earth being perpetuated).
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="PE"> A little further on, when you are a little more... mature, you attach much less importance to it. And when you are in constant communion with the sense of eternity, it becomes a mere question of choice; it's not a need anymore, because it's something that doesn't affect the active consciousness. A few days ago (I don't remember when, but quite lately), for a whole morning I lived in that Consciousness and I saw that, in the curve of the being's development, that sort of need, a seemingly intimate need, for the prolongation of the earth's life ‚Äì the indefinite prolongation of the earth's life ‚Äì I saw that that need is objectified, so to say, it's not so intimate anymore; it's like watching a performance and judging whether it should be like this or like that. It's interesting as a change of standpoint.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-218">It's like an artist, but an artist shaping himself, and who makes one attempt, two attempts, three attempts, as many attempts as necessary, then ends up with something complete enough in itself and receptive enough to be able to adapt to new manifestations, to the needs of new manifestations, so that it wouldn't be necessary to draw everything back in order to mix it all together again and put it all out again. But now it's now more than that, and, as I said, a question of choice. In other words, the manifestation was made for the delight of objectification (the delight or interest, or... anyway), and once what has been shaped has become plastic enough, receptive enough, supple enough and vast enough to be constantly molded by the new forces that manifest, there's no longer any need to undo everything in order to redo everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-219">The curve showed itself along with an adage: ‚ÄúWhat begins must end....‚Äù That seems to be one of those human mental constructions that aren't necessarily true.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-220">But the interesting point subjectively is that the problem loses its acuteness as you look at it from a higher and higher standpoint (or a more central point, to tell the truth).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-221">The principle ‚Äì not ‚Äúprinciple,‚Äù it's not a principle ‚Äì the law seems to be the same for the individual, worlds, and universes.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-222">The minute you try to express <em>(Mother makes a gesture of reversal)</em>, everything is warped....

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-223">We could say it's only limits that make differences: differences of time, differences of space, differences of scale, differences of power. They are only limits.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-224">Looking at it from that angle, we could say that the acceptance of limits is what permitted the manifestation. The possibility of the manifestation came with the acceptance of the sense of limit.... It's impossible to express. As soon as you start speaking, you always get a sense of something that goes like this <em>(same gesture of reversal)</em>, a sort of tipping over, and then it's finished, the essence is gone. Then metaphysical sense comes along and says, ‚ÄúWe might put it this way, we might put it that way....‚Äù To make sentences: each point contains the Consciousness of the Infinite and of Eternity (these are words, nothing but words). But the possibility of the experience is there. It's a sort of stepping back outside space.... We could say for fun that even the stone, even... ‚Äì oh, certainly water, certainly fire ‚Äì has the power of Consciousness: the original (all the words that come are idiotic!), essential, primordial (all this is meaningless), eternal, infinite Consciousness.... It's meaningless, to me it's like dust thrown on a pane of glass to prevent it from being transparent!... Anyway, conclusion: after having lived that experience (I had it repeatedly over the last few days, it remained there sovereignly despite everything ‚Äì work, activities ‚Äì and it ruled over everything), all attachment to any formula whatever, even those that have stirred peoples for ages, seems childishness to me.

Sri Aurobindo speaks of a play of hide and seek, but the play of hide and seek is interesting if one state of being doesn't deprive of the consciousness of the other states?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-241">Yesterday or the day before, the whole day from morning to evening, something was saying, ‚ÄúI am... I am or have the consciousness of a dead person on earth.‚Äù I am putting it into words, but it seemed to say, ‚ÄúThis is how the consciousness of a dead person is in relation to the earth and physical things.... I am a dead person living on earth.‚Äù According to the stand of the consciousness (because the consciousness changes its stand constantly), according to the stand of the consciousness, it was, ‚ÄúThis is how the dead are in relation to the earth,‚Äù then, ‚ÄúI am absolutely like a dead person in relation to the earth,‚Äù then, ‚ÄúI am the way a dead person lives without any consciousness of the earth,‚Äù then, ‚ÄúI am quite like a dead person living on earth...‚Äù and so on. And I went on speaking, acting, doing as usual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-242">But it has been like that for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-243">For a very long time, more than two years, I saw the world like this <em>(ascending gesture, from one level to a higher level)</em>, and now I
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 59</p>
<p class="PE"> see it like this <em>(descending gesture)</em>. I don't know how to explain it because there's nothing mentalized about it, and non-mentalized sensations have a certain haziness that's hard to define. But words and thought were a certain distance away <em>(gesture around the head)</em>, like something that watches and appreciates, in other words, that tells what it sees ‚Äì something around. And today, it has been extremely strong two or three times (I mean that that state dominated the whole consciousness): a sort of impression (or sensation or perception, but it's nothing like all that) of, ‚ÄúI am a dead person living on earth.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-244">How can I explain that?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-245">And then, with vision, for instance, the objective precision is missing <em>(Mother makes a gesture of not seeing through her eyes)</em>. I see through and with the consciousness. With hearing, I hear in a totally different way; there is a sort of ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù (it isn't ‚Äúdiscernment‚Äù), something that chooses in the perception, something that decides (that decides, but not arbitrarily ‚Äì automatically) what is heard and what isn't heard, what is perceived and what isn't perceived. It's already there in vision, but it's still stronger with hearing: with certain things, all that's heard is a continuous drone; others are heard very clearly, as clear as crystal; still others are blurred, half heard. With sight, it's the same thing: everything is behind a sort of luminous fog (very luminous, but it's a fog, which means there is no precision), then all at once, a particular thing will be absolutely precise and clear, seen with a most precise vision of detail. The vision is generally the expression of the consciousness in things. That is, everything seems to become more and more subjective, less and less objective.... And they aren't visions that impose themselves on the sight, or noises that impose themselves on the hearing: it's a sort of movement of consciousness that makes certain things perceptible and keeps others as if in a very imprecise background.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-246"><em>The consciousness chooses what it wants to see.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-247">There's nothing personal ‚Äì nothing personal. There is obviously the sense of a choice and a decision, but there is no sense of a personal choice and decision ‚Äì moreover, the ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù is reduced to the necessity of making this <em>(Mother pinches the skin of her hand)</em> intervene. With eating, for example, it's very odd ‚Äì very odd.... It's like someone who is watching over a body (which isn't even a very precise and defined thing, but a sort of conglomerate holding
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 60</p>
<p class="PE"> together), a spectator of... something happening! No, it's really an odd state. Today, since I got up and till now, it has been very strong, dominating the whole consciousness. And there are even times when you feel that a mere nothing could make you lose contact <em>(gesture of disconnection, as if the link with the body were severed)</em>, and that only if you remain very still and very indifferent ‚Äì indifferent ‚Äì can it continue.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-248">In the consciousness of the people, the whole morning, it was translated by (all this is perceived very clearly), by the thought, ‚ÄúOh, Mother is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> tired.‚Äù But there is that sort of state of indifference, unreceptive to the vibration around, which enables you to go on, otherwise you feel that... <em>(same gesture of disconnection)</em> something would be seriously disrupted. Once or twice I had to draw within and become still. And it's going on. And in fact, while it was like that something came and told me (but all this wordlessly), ‚ÄúWhen Satprem is here, you will understand.‚Äù Then there was tranquillity, because the moment was... (what shall I say?) very uncertain. And there was a sort of relaxing: ‚ÄúYou will understand when he is here, you will have the explanation.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-249">Those experiences are always preceded by the Supreme Presence drawing near in a very intimate and inner way, with a sort of suggestion, ‚ÄúAre you ready for anything?‚Äù (that was two nights ago). Naturally I answered, ‚ÄúAnything.‚Äù And the Presence takes on such a wonderful intensity that there is a sort of thirst in the whole being for it to be constantly like that. Nothing but That exists anymore, nothing but That has a raison d'√™tre anymore. And in the middle of it comes this suggestion: ‚ÄúAre you ready for anything?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-250">I am talking about the body. It's not the inner beings, it's the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-251">And the body always says yes, it does like this <em>(gesture of surrender)</em>. No choice, no preference, no aspiration, even: a total, complete surrender. So then, things of that sort come to me; yesterday, all day long, it was: ‚ÄúA dead person living on earth.‚Äù With the perception (not a very pronounced perception yet, but clear enough) of a vast difference between the way of life [of this body] and that of other people, of all the others, the people who talk to me, the people with whom I live. It isn't clear-cut yet, or sharp or very precise, but it's very clear ‚Äì very clear, very perceptible. It's another way of life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-252"><em>One would tend to say that it's not a gain from the standpoint of consciousness, since things become blurred. I don't know, is</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-253"><em>that way of being a gain?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-254">It can only be a transition. It's a transitory mode.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-255">From the standpoint of consciousness, it's a tremendous gain! Because all slavery, all bonds with external things, all that is finished, it has completely fallen off ‚Äì completely fallen off: there's absolute freedom. In other words, That alone remains, the Supreme Master is the master. From that point of view, it can only be a gain. It's such a radical realization.... It seems to be an absolute of freedom, something that's considered impossible to realize while living the ordinary life on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-256">It corresponds to the experience of absolute freedom one has in the higher parts of the being when one has become completely independent of the body. But the remarkable point (I lay great stress on this) is that it's the consciousness <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OF THE BODY</span> that has those experiences... and it's a body that's still visibly here (!)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-257">Of course, there is nothing left of what gives human beings ‚Äútrust of life.‚Äù There doesn't seem to be any support from the outward world left; there is only... the supreme Will. To put it into ordinary words, well, the body feels it lives only because the supreme Lord wants it to live, otherwise it wouldn't be able to live.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-258"><em>Yes, but it seems to me that a state of perfection should embrace everything, so that one can be in the supreme state without its abolishing the material state.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-259">But it doesn't abolish it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-260"><em>No, but still you say it's ‚Äúfar away,‚Äù ‚Äúbehind a veil,‚Äù that it no longer has its exactness and precision.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-261">That's a purely human and superficial perception. I don't at all feel that I have lost anything, on the contrary! I have the sense of a state much superior to the one I had.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-262"><em>Even from the material standpoint?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-263">What the Lord wants is done ‚Äì that's all; it begins there and ends there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-264">If He told me... Whatever He wants the body to do, it can do; it no longer depends on physical laws.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-267"><em>And when He wants to see or wants to hear materially, it sees perfectly and hears perfectly.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-268">Oh, perfectly! At times the sight is more precise than it ever was. But it's fleeting: it comes and goes; probably because it's only as an assurance of what will be. But, for instance, the perception of people's inner reality (not what they think they are or what they pretend to be or what they appear to be ‚Äì all that disappears), the perception of their inner reality is infinitely more precise than formerly. If I see a photograph, for example, there's no question anymore of seeing ‚Äúthrough‚Äù something: I almost exclusively see what the person <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span>. The ‚Äúthrough‚Äù decreases to such a point that at times it no longer exists at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-269">Naturally, if a human will wanted to exert itself on this body, if a human will said, ‚ÄúMother must do this‚Äù or ‚ÄúMother must do that,‚Äù or ‚Äúshe must be able to do this, she must be able to do that ...,‚Äù it would be totally disappointed, it would say, ‚ÄúShe has become useless,‚Äù because this body wouldn't obey it anymore. And human beings constantly exert their will on each other, or they themselves receive suggestions and manifest them as their own will, without realizing that it's all the external Falsehood.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-270">There is a sort of certitude in the body that if, for the space of just a few seconds, I lost contact (‚ÄúI,‚Äù meaning the body), if the body lost contact with the Supreme, it would die that very moment. It's only the Supreme that keeps it alive. That's how it is. So naturally, to the ignorant and stupid consciousness of human beings, that's a pitiable condition ‚Äì and to me, it's the true condition! Because for them, instinctively, spontaneously and in a so to say absolute way, the sign of perfection is the power of life, of ordinary life.... Well, that no longer exists at all ‚Äì it's completely gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-271">Yes, quite a few times, several times, the body did ask the question, ‚ÄúWhy don't I feel Your Power and Your Force in me?‚Äù And the answer was always a smiling answer (I am putting it into
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 63</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-273">There was something I thought yesterday I should tell you, but now I don't remember.... In fact, I think we did it last night!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-274"><em>What happened last night?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-275">Oh, all sorts of things always happen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-276">It's always on a plane of intellectual organization.... ‚ÄúIntellectual,‚Äù meaning that it doesn't go lower than the intellectual: it's something coming from above which we spread and organize in the terrestrial mind ‚Äì that's where we always meet. ‚ÄúMeet‚Äù isn't exactly the word: it's a habit of work. I must be going there very regularly, but when the night is full of lots and lots of things, I don't always remember. But last night, it so happens that I became conscious at that moment; it seems to be a very habitual activity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-277">It's a place (I have already told you about it<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24" href="#">1</a>), a place which is very, very vast, very open and luminous, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY PEACEFUL</span>.

Now and then one sees a sort of very small shining steel bar <em>(Mother draws a sort of frame that seems to delimit the place)</em>, like silver, now and then; and now and then, one feels there are kinds of cupboards that one opens, shelves, but transparent, it's all transparent. There are tables, but transparent; they're solid since one can write on them, but they're transparent. No object is in the way. But everything is organized

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-278">But I meet you there very regularly. Only, I must say that before going to bed I thought I would see you today and I wondered if I would have something to tell you, an experience or something else, and then, in the middle of the night (between half past midnight and one), I woke up, if I may say so, I awoke there, materially, and I remembered everything. I thought, ‚ÄúWell, well!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-279">What we tell each other, what we talk about with words, I don't know. I don't have a sense of uttering words, but we communicate very well: we each know what the other thinks; we speak, answer one another; and then we organize. And there were people from different countries ‚Äì we were arranging things. It seems to be the place of intellectual directives for the work in different countries.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-280">You must probably lack what Th√©on called the ‚Äúsubstance‚Äù of certain planes in the consciousness of your being, so when you wake up you don't remember, it doesn't come through. But maybe you are left with an impression, no?</p>

But it isn't substantial. It's probably my translation ‚Äì translation in the physical consciousness ‚Äì that gives the impression of... of what?... They are like huge, huge ‚Äúhalls,‚Äù and so high! There's no ceiling, you don't see any ceiling; you don't see any floor, yet you walk ‚Äì you walk, but without the feeling of walking: you move about.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-283">It's very conscious, but not at all material.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-284">But it's a state of being in which, in thought, you very often are.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-315">These last few days I have had examples of all the possible complications of the physical world, including practices of hypnotism and so-called black magic and all the phenomena that take place in the invisible realm, but just adjoining the physical ‚Äì like certain materializations, certain disappearances (incidents I saw and was obliged to note; I was obliged to note that they weren't imaginings but things that really took place), but then, with the secret revealed: how they can take place. It's very, very interesting. How it can happen, how the contact with certain distorting vibrations makes certain things possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-316">Yesterday evening, after I had written that message (I wrote it in the evening, not in comfort but that was the only time I had; the light wasn't good, but anyway I did it), after I had written, I felt a strong pain here, in my temples. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúnow I know!‚Äù Now and then, after having listened to lots of people and especially after having written lots of birthday cards, answers to letters there is a sort of strange heaviness in my temples (and I've never had headaches in my life, that's not like me!), and I say to myself, ‚ÄúWhat's this new decrepitude?!‚Äù Then I noticed it wasn't that: it's my eyes. It's because I haven't yet found the secret of how to use my eyes. As I said just before, at times I see with extraordinary precision: things seem to come towards me to show themselves it's so clear that the minutes' detail is perceived. That's one extreme. The other extreme is what I have already told several times: a sort of veil. I know things, they are in my consciousness, but I see just clearly enough not to bump against them or knock them over; everything, everything seems to be behind a veil; only I know where things are, so I find them, or I don't bump against them or break them, but that's not because I see ‚Äì I see a picture behind a veil, as it were. That's the other extreme. In between the two, there are all sorts of gradations. And I am convinced it's to
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 69</p>
<p class="PE"> show me that my eyes are still capable of seeing accurately ‚Äì the instrument is still very good, but I don't know how to use it. I don't know how to use it, because previously I used it as everyone uses his eyes, his hands, his feet, out of a sort of habit, more or less consciously ‚Äì I was very proud of my consciousness! <em>([Laughing]</em> We are always very proud!) Very proud to have such conscious hands; in the past, for instance, I would sometimes say, ‚ÄúI want twelve sheets of paper,‚Äù then I would stop bothering about it ‚Äì my hand would go and take, and there were twelve of them. That had been happening for a long, a very long time, but it would happen <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT CERTAIN TIMES</span>: when I was in the required state, that is, when there wasn't the intrusion of an arbitrary will. So all this is a field of experiment and study in very small details, absolutely insignificant in themselves, but very instructive. And it goes on all the time, twenty-four hours a day, night and day (at night it's on other planes), but all this takes place in the physical, a more or less subtle physical.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-317">This morning, there was a very amusing story. I was rinsing my eyes and mouth; I do it before daybreak, that is, with electric light. And in my bathroom there is an emergency light. It's one of the latest inventions: it's connected to the power and as long as there is power, the light remains off and a battery inside gets charged; as soon as the power fails, the light turns on and the battery is discharged to keep the light on. It's very well made, they invented it for hospitals and other places where any power failure must be avoided: as soon as the power goes, the light turns on instantaneously, and when the power returns, it goes off and gets recharged for the next time. They installed it for me in the bathroom. And this morning while I was washing my teeth, poff! the light went off. I continued, naturally, since I had that emergency light. But then, I did a study. The lights in C.'s room (and everywhere) were on, it was only here, in this group of rooms. That was an odd phenomenon to begin with. Then I ‚Äúlooked,‚Äù and while I looked I noticed something I hadn't taken note of all these last few days: a will to disorganize all my personal life. And causing power failures is one of the known occult methods (I don't know how it's done, in fact, but that man who wrote books and came here a very long time ago, Brunton, said it was one of the tricks known to those who practice occultism: a sudden failure of the lights). There are lots of other such tricks designed to disorganize people's lives with the idea of frightening them or announcing catastrophes to them (I have always found this very childish). But then, I saw
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 70</p>
<p class="PE"> that there was (I think I know where, here, it comes from) a will for disorganization, and I saw the path it followed <em>(winding gesture as if Mother were going back to the source)</em>. It had begun last night, in the middle of the night: when I got up around midnight, I saw a will wanting to preoccupy me with thoughts of money! And it was insisting: the thought that everything was going wrong, and so on. I saw that in the middle of the night. I was busy with other things, but I saw that will: formations; and naturally I dealt with them as they deserved. But I saw that it went on, trying to disturb people, to make them uncomprehending, and then to turn the power off, all sorts of silly things. It's not the first time it has happened ‚Äì it's not always the same people because generally, when they have tried and got a good knock in return, they don't try a second time, they've had enough! But there are others who think they are very clever and want to prove to me... <em>(laughing)</em> that they are right and I am wrong ‚Äì because ultimately it always comes to that! So I spent half an hour this morning, before they restored the power and I resumed my usual activities, half an hour having huge fun following the thread <em>(same winding gesture going back to the source)</em> wherever there was <em>mischief</em>, and then I very kindly ‚Äúanswered.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-318">In reality, people who live in the ordinary consciousness know very, very little of what goes on physically ‚Äì very little. They think they know, but all they know is a very superficial appearance, just like... like a sheet of paper wrapping a package; there is the whole package underneath with all that it contains, but all they see is an appearance <em>(gesture of something as thin as cigarette paper)</em>. And they are so used to it that they always give an explanation. I asked, ‚ÄúHow is it that just this power connection here gave way?‚Äù (Lights were on everywhere, only the connection here, which supplies my room, was off.) I asked ‚Äúto see.‚Äù They told me, ‚ÄúOh, we don't know, maybe the wire was old and it broke‚Äù! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> I said, ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-319">That's how it is. And it's very funny. Why do people who are in the habit of being relatively punctual suddenly and at the same time meet with something unexpected and are terribly late? And there is constantly something that comes and prevents things from happening quietly, harmoniously, easily. Then you look inside yourself at the type of vibration present in all that, and you notice that little ‚Äúquiver‚Äù... because it is a quiver <em>(Mother gestures to show a microscopic tremor)</em> caused by the ordinary vibration of the ordinary consciousness. The ordinary consciousness lives in a
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 71</p>
<p class="PE"> constant quiver, when you notice it it's frightful! As long as you don't notice it, it's perfectly natural, but when you notice it, you wonder how people don't go insane, it's a grace. It's a sort of tiny tremor <em>(same microscopic and very rapid gesture)</em>, oh, how horrible!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-320">So, if for some reason or other there is a disorganization (but I think the reason is one of teaching), one must have the capacity to go like this <em>(Mother brings her two hands down in a gesture that immobilizes everything)</em> and to stop all that instantly. But the capacity has been there for a long time, a long time (it hasn't always been used, but it has been there): the Power. And it's the same with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span>: world events or natural or human upheavals, earthquakes and tidal waves, volcanic eruptions, floods, or else wars, revolutions, people killing each other without even knowing why ‚Äì as they are doing at the moment: everywhere something pushes them on. Behind this ‚Äúquiver,‚Äù there is a will for disorder that tries to prevent Harmony from being established. It's there in the individual, in the collectivity, and in Nature. And then, it's such a painstaking, persistent teaching, which forgets nothing and is repeated every time something isn't totally understood, and is repeated in greater detail for you to better understand... the working: the working in the hands, in the activity, in the Force going through [Mother] like this, in the use of vibrations ‚Äì and which teaches the great Lesson: learning how to manifest the divine Force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-321">It's absolutely wonderful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-322">And if you look at it from the wrong side, it<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="27" href="#">1</a> is a tension, it's like something that doesn't leave you a second's respite. And it's true, it doesn't allow you to fall asleep one minute; because in the ordinary consciousness, in the general ordinary life, rest means <em>tamas</em>. Rest means falling back into Inertia. So then, instead of a rest that benefits you, it's a rest that stupefies you and then you have to make effort once more to recapture the consciousness you have lost. That's how the vast majority of people sleep. But now, the lesson is different: when I lie down to rest my body and work without moving (work with an activity that doesn't force the body to move), as soon as there is the slightest... not exactly ‚Äúfall,‚Äù but the slightest descent towards the Inconscient, something in the body immediately gives a start ‚Äì instantly. It has been like that for a long time, two years, but now it's instantaneous, and it very
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 72</p>
<p class="PE"> rarely happens ‚Äì there is true rest, which is an expansion and immensity of the being in full Light. It's magnificent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-323">But during the day, there are perpetual lessons, all the time, all the time, for everything, all the time. The lesson is least pronounced when I have to write something or see people; but there, too, the exact quality of people's vibration (not their permanent vibration but the vibration in them at that minute), the quality of their consciousness is immediately made known to me through certain reactions in my body <em>(gesture on different levels of the body)</em>. The nerves began only a few months ago their work of ‚Äútransfer of power.‚Äù (What I call ‚Äútransfer of power‚Äù is that instead of the nerves being moved by and obeying complex and organized forces of Nature, of the character, of the material consciousness in the body, they attune themselves to and directly obey the divine Will.) It's the transfer from one to the other that's difficult: there is the entire old habit, and then the new habit to be formed. It was a rather difficult moment. But now there remain enough old vibrations to be able to gauge exactly (and this has nothing to do with thought, it isn't expressed in words or thoughts or anything like all that: just vibrations), to know exactly the state people near me are in. From that point of view the lesson is going on, it's very interesting. And what's wonderful is that more often than not the most receptive vibration, conforming the most to what it should be, is in children, but the very small ones, the tiny tots.... I see lots of people, but now I understand why: I learn enormously that way, through that contact (with people whom I don't know, sometimes whom I see for the first time, or whom I haven't seen for years). It's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-324">But when nobody is there or I am alone, or when I don't speak or I am not busy with other people, it's the inner lesson: the whole change in the vibration and how the world is organized. This morning, it was really extraordinarily amusing to see the mass of things that lie behind this appearance, an appearance that seems complicated enough as it is, but it's nothing! It's thin, flimsy, without complexity in comparison with the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MASS</span> of things behind, which... <em>(drilling gesture)</em> which bore their way through to reach the surface. It's amusing. But certainly ninety-nine people in a hundred would be seized with panic if they knew, if they saw. I had always been told (I read it, Sri Aurobindo often said it to me, Th√©on too often said it to me, so did Madame Th√©on) that it's the Grace that keeps people from knowing. Because if they knew, they would be terrified! All, but all the things that are constantly there,
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 73</p>
<p class="PE"> moving behind ‚Äì behind the appearances ‚Äì all the complexities that are the true causes of or the instruments for all those small events, which to us are absolutely unimportant, but because of which one day you feel everything is harmonious, and another day you feel it takes a labor to do anything at all. And that's how it is. And naturally, when you know, you have the key. But if you know before you have the key, it's... a little frightening. I think that when people take leave of their senses, it's because they are put in contact with the vibrations before having the knowledge, the sufficient knowledge, the sufficient state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-325">There, we've wasted all our time!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-326"><em>But how is the transition made? The transition that materializes? What is the secret of the passage from that very subtle physical to the physical proper? How is the passage made from one side to the other?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-327">Mon petit, I don't know what comparison I should use, but I am certain there are some things that are invisible this way <em>(Mother rotates her wrist in one direction)</em>, and visible that way <em>(gesture in the other direction)</em>. My impression is that what we see as a considerable difference between the tangible, the material, and the invisible or the fluid, is only a change of position. Perhaps an internal change of position because it isn't a physical, material change of position, but it is a change of position. Because I have experienced this I don't know how many times, hundreds of times: like this <em>(gesture in one direction)</em>, everything is what we call ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù as we are used to seeing it, then all of a sudden, like that <em>(gesture in the other direction)</em>, the nature of things changes. And nothing has happened, except something within, something in the consciousness: a change of position. Do you remember that aphorism in which Sri Aurobindo says that everything depends on a change in the relation of the sun-consciousness and the 
earth-consciousness?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="28" href="#">2</a> When I read it the first time, I didn't understand, I thought it was something in the very subtle realms; and then, very recently, in one of those experiences, I suddenly understood, I said, ‚ÄúBut that's it!‚Äù It isn't a shift since nothing moves, yet it is
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 74</p>
<p class="PE"> a shift, it is a change of relation. A change of position. It's no more tangible than that, that's what is so wonderful! Oh, the other day, I found another sentence of Sri Aurobindo's: ‚ÄúNow everything is different, yet everything has remained the same.‚Äù (It was on one of my birthday cards.) I read that and said to myself, ‚ÄúOh, that's what it means!‚Äù It's true, now everything is different, yet everything has remained the same. We understand it psychologically, but it's not psychological: it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HERE</span> <em>(Mother touches matter)</em>. But until one has a solid base... From the standpoint of concrete, physical, material things, I don't think there's anyone more materialistic than I was, with all the practical common sense and positivism; and now I understand why it was like that: it gave my body a marvelous base of equilibrium. It prevented me from having the very sort of madness we were talking about 
earlier.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="29" href="#">3</a> The explanations I asked for were always material, I always sought the material explanation, and it seemed obvious to me there's no need of any mystery, nothing of the sort ‚Äì you just explain things materially. Therefore I am certain this isn't a tendency to mystic dreaming in me, not at all, not at all, this body had nothing mystic! Nothing... Thank God!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-328">I saw that (not in my head, because for me there are no such limits), in this sort of conglomerate, here: the nearest explanation is a ‚Äúshift‚Äù ‚Äì a shift, the angle of perception becoming different. And it's not really that, words are incorrect, because it's far more subtle and at the same time far more complete than that. I have watched the change several times; well, this change gives you, to the outward consciousness, the sense of a shift. A motionless shift, meaning that you don't change places. And it's not, as we might be tempted to think, a drawing within and a drawing without, it's not that at all, not at all ‚Äì it's an angle of perception that changes. You are in a certain angle, then you are in another.... I have seen small objects of that sort for the amusement of children: when those objects are in a certain position, they look compact and hard and black, and when you turn them another way, they are clear, luminous, transparent. It's something like that, but it's not that, that's an approximation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-329"><em>But if we know the way in which the change is effected, we can...</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-330"><em>... we can stop the entry of bad vibrations?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-331">As for me, I have only one method (but I can conceive that this is simply because that's the way my nature is), I have only one method, it's self-abolition, the idea (not an ‚Äúidea‚Äù) that the Supreme alone exists.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-332">That's another interesting point, because I was an outright atheist: till the age of twenty, the very idea of God made me furious. Therefore I had the most solid base ‚Äì no imaginings, no mystic atavism; my mother was very much an unbeliever and so was my father. So from the point of view of atavism it was very good: positivism, materialism. Only one thing: since I was very small, a will for perfection in any field whatever; a will for perfection and the sense of a limitless consciousness ‚Äì no limits to one's progress or to one's power or to one's scope. And that, since I was very small. But mentally, an absolute refusal to believe in a ‚ÄúGod‚Äù: I believed only in what I could touch and see. And the whole faculty for experiences was already there (they didn't manifest because the time hadn't come). Only, the sense of a Light here <em>(gesture above the head)</em>, which began when I was very small, I was five, along with a will for perfection. A will for perfection: oh, whatever I did always had to be the best I could do. And then, a limitless consciousness. These two things. And my return to the Divine came about through Th√©on's teaching, when I was told for the first time, ‚ÄúThe Divine is within, there‚Äù <em>(Mother strikes her breast)</em>. Then I felt at once, ‚ÄúYes, this is it.‚Äù Then I did all the work that's taught to find Him again; and through here <em>(gesture to the heart center)</em> I went there <em>(gesture of junction above with the Supreme)</em>. But outwardly, mentally, no religion ‚Äì a horror of religions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-333">And I see now that it was the most solid base possible for this experience: there was no danger of imaginings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-334">I have tried many things, a great many, I have looked a great deal, and I see only one that's absolute ‚Äì only one that's absolute and can bring the absolute result, it's this <em>(gesture turned Upward)</em>: the complete annulment of all that, leaving it all, ‚ÄúTo You, Lord ‚Äì You, You, to You.‚Äù And it isn't a being with a form, that's not it; it isn't a formless force, it's...

And we were working so simply, effortlessly....

There is always a difficult transition then. Even now for the body, each part, when it changes (what I used to call the ‚Äúchange of master‚Äù), there is a transition when it becomes absolutely useless, you feel it's finished.

‚ÄúAt first one loves only when one is loved....‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-390">Yes, that's an experience I personally had. There is a time when one is <em>quite</em> capable of loving <em>without</em> response, one is above <em>the</em> need <em>to</em> be loved, <em>but</em> one <em>still has... not</em> positively <em>a</em> need, <em>but, at least, a wish that</em> one's love <em>may be</em> felt <em>and be</em> effective.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-391">Afterwards, <em>it makes</em> one smile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-392" style="text-align: center;">‚ÄúAnd finally one loves purely and simply<br/> without any other need or joy than that of loving.‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 87</p>
<p class="PE"> That, to me, according to my personal experience, is really omnipotence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-393">It's a power than can achieve anything ‚Äì anything at all. Nothing is impossible to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-394">But I have also carefully observed that if ‚Äúthat‚Äù manifested indiscriminately, as it were, if it came as something that imposed itself in the earth atmosphere without control or discernment, it would be... All that denies that Power (denies it wittingly or unwittingly) would be as though annulled. So the outward, apparent consequences would be... too awesome. That's what Sri Aurobindo wrote; he said Knowledge must come first. Truth must reign before Love can manifest <em>massively ‚Äì a wholesale manifestation</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-395">Now it's filtered, as it were. It is still filtered.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-396">But the vibratory quality of ‚Äúthat‚Äù is truly something beyond all imagination. Diseases, difficulties... none of it has any reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-397">The body constantly used to ask (not a sign or an assurance or a proof: it's all of that together), it used to ask for a sort of sensation (sensation, if it can be called that) that ‚Äúit is the Lord that rules‚Äù (I am putting it in childlike words because they are the truest), that it is the Lord that rules. It asked for ‚Äúthat‚Äù all the time, the way a child could ask: ‚Äúthat‚Äù in all the innumerable nothings one does all the time, which are the very fabric of the body's existence. It became so intense.... Anything perceived as separate from ‚Äúthat‚Äù becomes inert: ashes. Inert without even the power of inertia: the inertia of dust. I mean that a rock has a power in its existence, a power of cohesion, of duration ‚Äì it's not even that: it's dust. So then, there was constantly, constantly that prayer in the body. And that's what led me to the experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-398">When ‚Äúthat‚Äù is there, everything seems to swell with a golden, luminous, radiating Power: it's so intense as to have volume!... If that isn't there, everything is dust.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-399">So, naturally, there is constantly in all the cells the aspiration, the intense will for there to remain nothing but That.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-400">And all that denies That or counters It, weakens It or dims It, becomes painful. Yes, painful ‚Äì not painful with a moral or psychological or material suffering... it's a strange thing, it's not a physical pain: it's a pain which is more material than physical, it is... a sort of suffocation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-401">The body now really has an impression (it's an impression, not a knowledge ‚Äì it's not a thought, not a knowledge: it's an impression, but a strong one) that this is what kills, this is what makes you die: this sort of refusal of the Vibration ‚Äì not always even a

<p class="p-num">Page 88</p>
<p class="PE"> willed refusal, because it's not even conscious the way will is (that happens, but then it means battle), but it's in Matter. One wonders if there isn't a residue ‚Äì a residue of dust ‚Äì that's incapable of any receptivity? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-402">I don't know.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-446">We have some time for <em>Savitri</em>... unless you have something to ask?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-447"><em>I wonder why I don't see clearer in what I do?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-448">Because there are two ideas in conflict. That's why. So there is hesitation between the two standpoints.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-449">Two standpoints: the need for renunciation and the futility of fleeing. Those are the two ideas that cause the hesitation. But in the chronological order of things, it should first be the need for renunciation, then the discovery of the futility of fleeing, and then instead of a fleeing, there should be a return, free, without attachment. A return to life without attachment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-450">Apart from that, I understand: in order to write a book, one generally cannot describe more than one cycle, because there's a beginning, a development, and a culmination, a realization. Then another book, which starts from that realization and has the full experience of its futility. And then, the crowning realization: the return to life, free.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-451">One may have the three together, but it makes a very compact book.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-454"><em>There's a poem, a very short one ‚Äì not a poem, a sort of voice. Then in the first chapter, my character has to take the boat and go away (as usual).

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-455">Where does the boat go?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-456"><em>A little farther away, as always. He just has to go.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-458"><em>He meets him a first time, then a second time just when he is about to leave, so he changes all his plans and goes with the Sannyasin.... But it's what comes before that departure, there is something hazy, I don't know what I should do. First I thought of making that young woman the symbol of beauty, wealth, love, anyway, of all that's truly beautiful and all the best life can bring ‚Äì which he rejects, and he leaves for anywhere, and then he meets that Sannyasin. So I was in the description of that place, of that boy with that girl, of that very beautiful place, and then I found it so futile to write all this that I couldn't go on.</em></p>
<p class="Q"><em>(Mother laughs)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-459"><em>It was so futile, all that beauty and everything, to me it seemed like nothing at all.</em></p>

I left everything and went off.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="PE"> And is that the story you tell in the book?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-462"><em>That's what I started telling.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-464"><em>But I find it so futile to evoke again all that so-called beauty that I just can't do it! I find it all hollow, my words are false.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-465">But if you take that attitude, you can't write a book!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-466">Once again, these past few days, the memory of things I had written came back to me ‚Äì what I had imagined at some time and written... at the beginning of the century (before you were born!), in Paris. I wondered, ‚ÄúStrange, why am I thinking of this?‚Äù And there was, in that thing I wrote, this: ‚ÄúThe love of beauty had saved her.‚Äù It was the story of a woman who had had a heartbreak of so-called love, as human beings conceive it, but who had felt a need to manifest love, a marvelously beautiful love; and with that force and that ideal she had overcome her personal sorrow. I wrote a little book like that ‚Äì I don't know where it is, by the way, but that doesn't matter. But the memory of it suddenly came back and I wondered, ‚ÄúStrange, why am I remembering this?...‚Äù And then I remembered the whole curve of the consciousness. At that time, I clearly understood that personal things had to be overcome by the will to realize something more essential and universal. And I followed the curve of my own consciousness, how it began like that, and how from there I went on... to other things. I was eighteen. That was my first attempt to emerge from the exclusively personal viewpoint and pass on to a broader viewpoint, and to show that the broader, more universal viewpoint makes you overcome the personal things. But I wondered, ‚ÄúWhy am I remembering this?‚Äù Now I understand! It's there in what you have written, it's the same thing. Well, of course, now I wouldn't be able to write what I wrote, it would make me laugh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-467"><em>I can write, I can always...</em></p>

<p class="p-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-487"><em>Why? Were you in the formless Void?</em></p>
<p class="PE"> I saw that, it was so amusing! I saw it all. Oh, it was an extraordinary experience. All of a sudden I was outside and, I can't say ‚Äúabove‚Äù (but it was above), but outside the whole human creation, outside everything, everything man has created in all the worlds, even in the most ethereal worlds. And seen from there, it was... I saw that play of all the possible conceptions men have had of God and of the way to approach God (what they call ‚ÄúGod‚Äù), and also of the invisible worlds and the gods, all that: one thing came upon another, one upon another, it all went by (as it's written in <em>Savitri)</em>, one thing upon another went by <em>(gesture as if on a screen)</em>, one upon another... with its artificiality, its inadequacy to express the Truth. And with such precision! A precision so accurate that you felt in anguish, because the impression was of being in a world of nothing but imagination, of imaginative creation, but in nothing real, there wasn't a feeling of... of touching the Thing. To such a point that it became... yes, a terrible anguish: ‚ÄúBut then, what? What? What's truly <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span> and outside all that we can conceive?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-488">And it came. It was like this: <em>(gesture of self-abandon)</em> the total, complete self-annulment, annulment of that which can know, of that which tries to know ‚Äì even <em>‚Äúsurrender‚Äù isn't an</em> adequate word: a sort of annulment. And suddenly it ended with a slight movement as a child could have who doesn't know anything, doesn't try to know anything, doesn't understand anything, doesn't try to understand ‚Äì but who abandons himself. A slight movement of such simplicity, such ingenuousness, such extraordinary sweetness (words can't express it): nothing, just this <em>(gesture of self-abandon)</em>, and instantaneously, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> Certitude (not expressed, lived), the lived Certitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-489">I wasn't able to keep it very long. But ‚Äúit‚Äù is wonderful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-490">But the anguish had reached its peak: the sense of the futility of human efforts to understand ‚Äì to embrace and understand ‚Äì what isn't human, what's beyond. And I am talking about humanity in its supreme realizations, of course, when man feels himself to be a god.... That was still down below.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-491">The experience lasted, oh, I don't know, perhaps a few minutes, but it was... something.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-492">Only, with a certainty that as soon as you come back, as soon as you just try to speak one word (or even if you don't speak), as soon as you try to formulate in one way or another: finished.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 98</p>
<p class="PE"> <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> a transitory way to recapture the true Consciousness: it's something that has its own reality and that will have its own existence <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN THE TRUTH</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-494">That's the next step.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-495">That's why that realization [the Void] isn't the goal, that's exactly why. A conviction that it isn't the goal. It's an absolute necessity, but not the goal. The goal is something... the capacity to keep That here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-496">When will that come? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-497">But when it comes, everything will be changed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-498">Until then, let's prepare ourselves.</p>

When I have peace and quiet, there is a slight... not a movement, I don't know what it is: it might rather feel like pulsations, and depending on the case, there are different experiences. For instance, customary things take a usual amount of time when nothing abnormal happens, and then you have an exact sense of the time they take. So then, I am ‚Äúgiven‚Äù the following experience, of the same thing done in the same way, accomplished a first time in its normal duration, and another time, when I am in another state, that is, when the consciousness seems to be placed elsewhere, the thing seems to be done in a second! ‚Äì Exactly the same thing: habitual gestures, things you do absolutely every day, quite ordinary things. Then, another time (and it's not that I try to have it, I don't try at all: I am <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PUT</span> in that state), another time I am put in another state (to me, it doesn't make much difference, they are like very small differences in the concentration), and in that state, the same thing, oh, takes a long, long time, an endless time to get done! Just to fold a towel, for instance (I am not the one who does it), someone folds a towel or someone puts a bottle away, wholly material and absolutely simple things devoid of any psychological value; someone folds a towel that's on the floor (I am giving that example): there is a normal time, which I perceive internally after a study; it's the normal time, when everything is normal, that is, usual; then, I am in a certain concentration and... without my even having the time to notice it, it's done! I am in another state of concentration, with absolutely minimal differences as far as the concentration is concerned, and it's endless! You feel it takes half an hour to get done.</p>

He was like that ‚Äì he <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> like that, it wasn't a picture: he <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> like that.

He usually always has a very calm and very smiling, quiet face; but all of a sudden, it was quite tormented, and then he abruptly sat back on that sort of seat, a sort of couch. So I looked at him, and he told me, <em>‚ÄúOh, how they are distorting things. Look at this fellow, how they are distorting things.‚Äù</em> Almost immediately afterwards, it was time and I woke up, I got up.

So naturally, everything stops. But that's beside the point. Then, in that connection, he says he took that drug and he describes the effect <em>(Mother shows Satprem a passage of the letter)</em>:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-600">‚ÄúThe second time, with a normal dose of LSD (lysergic acid), as I rose in that luminous situation, I had terrible visions, the walls of my room came alive with thousands of malignant and desperate faces that persecuted me till night....‚Äù</p>

So it's an indication: for those who see smiling, pleasant, beautiful things, it means that the inner, vital condition is good enough, but with those who see terrifying or malicious things, or things like that, it means the vital isn't pretty.</p>

So then, the entry into the vital, for instance, is often described: there are passages where beings are stationed to stop you from entering (all those things are much talked about in all books of occultism). Well, I know from experience (not a passing one: an experience I learned repeatedly) that that opposition or ill will is ninety percent psychological, in the sense that if you don't anticipate it or don't fear it, or if there is nothing in you that's afraid of the unknown and none of those movements of apprehension and so on, it's like a shadow in a picture, or a projected image: it has no concrete reality.</p>

I asked him, ‚ÄúWould you like me to do your room and clean it? I won't touch anything.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúAh, if you don't touch anything...‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> So I left the papers on the bed, on the chair, on the table, on the shelves! I cleaned a shelf, then in a book I found some money. I told him (thinking it had been forgotten), I told him, ‚ÄúI found... a hundred, two hundred rupees‚Äù (I don't remember now) ‚Äúin a book.‚Äù (One banknote was in one place, another note was in another place.) He replied, ‚ÄúYes, I am forced to hide it, otherwise they take it from me!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-633">But I am no good at hiding places!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-634">You see, I instinctively go and take the book, I open it and find the money. So I asked him, ‚ÄúWould you like to entrust your money to me? I will keep it for you.‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúThat would make

<p class="p-num">Page 118</p>
<p class="PE"> It's because all the vital force is used to keep the body's balance in the phase of transformation. That's what I have called ‚Äúthe change of government,‚Äù it's the phase of transformation. And during that change, well, all the vital force is there just to keep your balance so you don't topple over. Because it's difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-647">One must remain very calm and do what is indispensable, nothing more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-648">In ordinary life, when one doesn't know, with people who don't know, there is a tremendous wastage of vital forces, for no reason. Well, we no longer have the right to do that because all that vital force is there, as I said, concentrated to keep the body's balance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-649">It's a very, very widespread state in all those who... not who do the yoga, but for whom the yoga is done. And it's done... (how can I put it?) almost without their knowledge ‚Äì all that puts them in a fit state to do it is, first, aspiration, and then, trust. Those are the two things: the faith, the trust that the divine Consciousness is at work, and then the aspiration for transformation. That's all that's needed. And the work is done. But that work implies, in fact, not a loss of equilibrium but a change of equilibrium. A change of balance. And in order to go from one equilibrium to the other, well, one must stay very calm.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-650">But the difficulty you are referring to is something I have every minute.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-651">People who don't know (there are many of them, almost all of them don't know) feel they are ill. But it's not an illness: it's a change of balance, which takes on all kinds of forms depending on each one's character and nature. So when you don't pay attention and there is a loss of balance, something happens which results in what doctors call ‚Äúan illness,‚Äù but if I had the time to have fun and ask them questions, they would be forced to tell me that each case is different ‚Äì each case: there aren't two identical cases. They say, ‚ÄúYes, it looks like this or it looks like that or it looks like this.‚Äù And it's nothing but the transition from the old millennial equilibrium to a new equilibrium which isn't yet established, and in the transition between the two, well... one must be careful, that's all. And cling very, very firmly to the higher Harmony.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-681"><em>Is the difficulty of the other day over?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-682">Oh, I've had an experience, a new experience. I mean, it's the cells of the body that have had a new experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-683">When I lie down on my bed at night, there is an offering of all the cells, which regularly <em>surrender</em> as completely as they can, with an aspiration not only for union but for fusion: let there remain nothing but the Divine. It's regular, every day, every single day. And for some time, these cells or this body consciousness (but it isn't organized as a consciousness: it's like a collective consciousness of the cells), it seemed to be complaining a little, to be saying, ‚ÄúBut we don't feel much. We do feel‚Äù (they can't say they don't feel: they feel protected, supported), ‚Äúbut still...‚Äù They are like children, they were complaining that it wasn't spectacular: ‚ÄúIt <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAS</span> to be marvelous.‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> Ah, very well, then! So two nights ago, they were in that state when I went to bed. I didn't move from the bed till about two in the morning. At two in the morning I got up, and I suddenly noticed that all the cells, the whole body (but it really is a cellular consciousness, not a body consciousness; it isn't the consciousness of this or that person: there's no person, it's the consciousness of a cellular aggregate), that consciousness felt bathed in and at the same time shot through by a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MATERIAL</span> power of a fan-tas-tic velocity bearing no relation to the velocity of light, none at all: the velocity of light is something slow and unhurried in comparison. Fantastic, fantastic! Something that must be like the movement of the centers out there... <em>(Mother gestures towards faraway galactic space)</em>. It was so awesome! I remained quite peaceful, still, I sat quite peaceful; but still, peaceful as I could be, it was so awesome, as when you are carried away by a movement and are going so fast that you can't breathe. A sort of discomfort. Not that I couldn't breathe, that wasn't the point, but the cells felt suffocated, it was so... awesome. And at the same time with a sensation of power, a power that nothing, nothing whatsoever can resist in any way. So I had been pulled out of my bed (I noticed it) so that the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BODY</span> consciousness (mark the difference: it wasn't the cells' consciousness, it was the body's consciousness) would teach the cells how to <em>surrender</em> and tell them, ‚ÄúThere is only one way: a total <em>surrender</em>, then you will
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 126</p>
<p class="PE"> no longer have that sensation of suffocation.‚Äù And there was a slight concentration, like a little lesson. It was very interesting: a little lesson, how it should be done, what should be done, how to abandon oneself entirely. And when I saw it had been understood, I went back to bed. And then, from that time (it was two, two: twenty) till quarter to five, I was in that Movement without a single break! And the peculiar thing was that when I got up, there was in that consciousness (which is both cellular and a bit corporeal) the sense of <em>Ananda</em> [divine joy] in everything the body did: getting up, walking, washing its eyes, brushing its teeth.... For the first time in my life I felt the Ananda (a quite impersonal Ananda), an Ananda in those movements. And with the feeling, ‚ÄúAh, that's how the Lord enjoys Himself.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-684">It's no longer in the foreground (it was in the foreground for an hour or two to make me understand), now it's a bit further in the background. But, you understand, previously the body used to feel that its whole existence was based on the Will, the surrender to the supreme Will, and endurance. If it was asked, ‚ÄúDo you find life pleasant?‚Äù, it didn't dare to say no, because... but it didn't find it pleasant. Life wasn't for its own pleasure and it didn't understand how it could give pleasure. There was a concentration of will in a surrender striving to be as perfect ‚Äì painstakingly perfect ‚Äì as possible, and a sense of endurance: holding on and holding out. That was the basis of its existence. Then, when there were transitional periods... which are always difficult, like, for instance, switching from one habit to another, not in the sense of changing habits but of switching from one support to another, from one impulsion to another (what I call the ‚Äútransfer of power‚Äù), it's always difficult, it occurs periodically (not regularly but periodically) and always when the body has gathered enough energy for its endurance to be more complete; then the new transition comes, and it's difficult. There was that will and that endurance, and also, ‚ÄúLet Your Will be done,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLet me serve You as You want me to, as I should serve You, let me belong to You as You want me to,‚Äù and also, ‚ÄúLet there remain nothing but You, let the sense of the person disappear‚Äù (it had indeed disappeared to a considerable extent). And there was this sudden revelation: instead of that base of endurance ‚Äì holding on at any cost ‚Äì instead of that, a sort of joy, a very peaceful but very smiling joy, very smiling, very sweet, very smiling, very charming ‚Äì charming! So innocent, something so pure and so lovely: the joy which is in all things, in everything we do, everything, absolutely everything. I was shown

<p class="PE"> last night: everything, but everything, there isn't one vibration that isn't a vibration of joy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-685">That's the first time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-686">So then, the result... <em>(laughing)</em> <em>is</em> that the body is a little better! It no longer feels that tension so much. But it has been advised to be very peaceful, very peaceful, above all no excitement, no ‚Äújoy‚Äù as one usually has it (the vital joy that is aware of itself and expresses itself), not that, nothing of all that: very peaceful, very peaceful. It's something so pure, oh!... So translucent, transparent, light....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-687">It's the first time I have felt this physically. Meaning it's the first time these cells have had this experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-688">You see, previously, they always felt the Lord's support in the power and the force, they felt they existed because of Him, they existed through Him, they existed in Him; they used to feel all that. But to be capable of feeling it, they had to have endurance ‚Äì absolute endurance ‚Äì to endure everything. Now it's not that; it's not that, there is something that smiles, but smiles so sweetly, so sweetly, and is, oh, extraordinarily amused, behind it all, and it's light, light, so light ‚Äì all the weight of that tension has disappeared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-689">And it's the result of that awesome ‚Äúflow‚Äù: a flow that carried the cells along; it wasn't that the cells were immobile and it was flowing through them: they were <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> the movement, they were moving with that same velocity ‚Äì a fantastic velocity with a dazzling luminosity and unimaginable speed, felt materially, like that. It was beyond all possibility of ordinary sensation. It lasted for hours.</p>

And they frequently talk (it seems it can be recorded), they talk but people don't understand what they say. And then, they were given our speech to listen to ‚Äì they imitate it and make fun of it!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-695">It's amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-696">I have also heard that other scientists have discovered ‚Äúimmediate transmission,‚Äù which doesn't follow the slow curve of wave transmissions or even of more ethereal transmissions, through what they call (I think) a sort of ‚Äúpendulum‚Äù or counterweight, so that what is done here is automatically reproduced there; if it goes down here, it goes up there, and if it goes down there, it goes up here, automatically. It's imitation (because they can't understand what it is), but it's intuitive communication, of course. It seems they have an instrument to measure it ‚Äì it's fantastic!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-698">Yes, that's right! Yes, but it's good to have everything, because as soon as the key is there, the whole thing will be done.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-713">That's precisely what I have been doing for two days! For the last two days I have spent all my time seeing all that... oh, an accumulation of heaps of sordid little things we constantly live in, sordid tiny little things. And then, there is only one way ‚Äì only one way, always the same: to offer it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-714">This Supreme Consciousness almost seems to put you in contact with quite forgotten things that belong to the past ‚Äì that are even, or that were or seemed, completely erased, with which you no longer had any contact: all kinds of little circumstances, but seen now in the new consciousness, in their true place, and because of which all life, all human life is such a pathetic, miserable, mean whole. And then, there's a luminous joy in offering all that for it to be transformed, transfigured.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-715">Now it has become the movement of even the cellular consciousness. All the weaknesses, all the response to adverse suggestions (I mean the tiny little things of every minute, in the cells), it sometimes
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 131</p>
<p class="PE"> comes in waves, to such a point that the body feels it's going to buckle under the onslaught, and then... there's such a warm, deep, sweet light, so powerful, which restores order everywhere, puts everything in its place and opens the road towards transformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-716">These phases are very difficult times for the body's life; you feel as if there only remains one thing that decides: the supreme Will. There's no support left ‚Äì no support; from the support of habit to the support of knowledge and the support of will, all the supports have disappeared: there is only the Supreme.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-717">The aspiration in the cellular consciousness to the perfect sincerity of the consecration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-718">And the lived experience ‚Äì intensely lived ‚Äì that only that absolute sincerity of the consecration allows existence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-719">The slightest pretense is an alliance with the forces of dissolution and death.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-720">So it's like a chant in the cells ‚Äì but they mustn't even have the insincerity to watch themselves ‚Äì the chant of the cells: ‚ÄúYour Will, Lord, Your Will...‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-721">And the immense habit of depending on the will of others, the consciousness of others, the reactions of others (of others and of all things), that sort of universal playacting everyone does for everyone and everything does for everything must be replaced by a spontaneous, absolute sincerity of consecration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-722">It is obvious that that perfection in sincerity is possible only in the most material part of the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-723">That's where you can be, exist, act without watching yourself be, without watching yourself exist, without watching yourself act, with perfect sincerity.</p>

<p class="PE"> I can clearly see that the initial cause always comes from outside (‚Äúoutside‚Äù with regard to this body), in the sense that the focus of the effort depends on the state of health of the people around me, on a certain set of circumstances, and also on an intellectual work (like this <em>Bulletin)</em>; those are the causes. Because here <em>(gesture to the forehead)</em>, there's really a tranquil and silent stillness. So there's only what comes from outside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-727">And the body is increasingly conscious: it has a very acute perception of the vibrations coming from the old habits, from the old ways of being and from the opposition, and of the presence of the True Vibration. So it's a question of dose and proportion, and when the amount, the sum total of the old vibrations, the old habits, the old responses, is too great, that creates a disorder which takes stillness and concentration in order to be overcome, and which gives such a clear and intense perception of how precarious the equilibrium and existence are. And then, behind: a Glory. The Glory of the divine Light, the divine Will, the divine Consciousness, the eternal Motive.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(The conversation begins with the book Satprem is writing, which Mother ‚Äúdictates‚Äù at night, but which Satprem has difficulty receiving.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-728">Mon petit, I keep on writing! It's incredible! It has never happened to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-729">Fantastic things...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-730">But is it coming along?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-731"><em>Not much, not fast at all.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-732">Do you write in sequence or did you begin with the end?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-733"><em>No, no, I always write in sequence.... It's not coming easily, it's not coming smoothly at all. I wonder where the blockage is.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 133</p>
<p class="PE"> It's because when one starts writing, one enters the mental atmosphere, the human mental atmosphere. And the passage is almost imperceptible, there's such a habit of thinking, of expressing oneself, of feeling within a human mental atmosphere... which is nevertheless, in comparison with the human individual, something very vast, very complex, very supple (and those who move about in it already have the sense of a higher intelligence, an exceptional understanding and so on), but from the standpoint of the Truth, it's so artificial and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONVENTIONAL</span>! It's a very durable convention, which undergoes slight changes, alterations according to the times, the ages, but which has some sort of permanence. I feel it as... <em>(Mother makes a circular gesture around her head)</em> a globe one is inside, luminous but so artificial!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-734">This morning, I had, for instance, a whole series of experiences regarding the notion of selfishness. I remember that the first time someone said to Sri Aurobindo in my presence (many years ago) about someone else, ‚ÄúOh, he is selfish,‚Äù Sri Aurobindo smiled and answered, ‚ÄúSelfish? But the most selfish of all is the Divine, since everything belongs to Him and He sees everything in relation to Himself!‚Äù I found it rather daring! And this morning (strangely, just this morning; it's not the first time, either), I suddenly felt how false that notion of selfishness is and that sort of reprobation of the selfish, with, at the same time, all the shades of leniency, understanding, how false all that is, that whole world, how rigid and outside the Truth. ‚ÄúOutside the Truth,‚Äù not that its opposite would be true, no, that's not the point! It's that sort of ‚Äúmoral-mental‚Äù notion, which is such a self-evident affair that nobody questions it ‚Äì how far, far away it is from the Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-735">But this morning's experience was luminous because I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVED</span> in the Truth. And I experienced both the true atmosphere and the conventional atmosphere. But a convention that's not local or of a particular period, of a time or a place, that's not it: they are kinds of conventions <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CREATED</span> by the human consciousness, which take on nuances ‚Äì they are quite supple ‚Äì which take on nuances and transform themselves according to the need, but they really are conventions. It seemed to me like a balloon ‚Äì immense, as large as the earth, much larger than the earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-736">And at the same time I also had the experience (an experience I've had very, very often) that when you live in the Light, there is perfect comprehension, and it isn't something reflected or seen, that's not it, it is... something that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span>, that exists: a living Light. And as soon as you want to express it, it gets into the balloon, and
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 134</p>
<p class="PE"> then it becomes conventional (even without uttering words: just saying it to yourself). When you are like this <em>(immobile gesture turned Upward)</em>, then it's The Thing. And as soon as you try to formulate it to yourself, and, even more so, to write it, it seems to get into the balloon and it becomes conventional. To such a point that these days it's very difficult for me, when I am active, to write anything, I find it so flat and dry and distorted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-737">But at night... (laughing) as if by reaction, I dictate all kinds of things! But I don't remember what I write, it's absolutely elsewhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-738"><em>But I feel that artificiality constantly.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-739"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-740"><em>Constantly. But I don't know, I am waiting for, hoping for something that will be pure or true. But I constantly feel that artificiality.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-741"><em>That's right.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-742">We're probably on the verge of the solution. It's always like that. We'll see.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-743">The marvelous thing is that as soon as you get out of it, there's... phew! You seem to burst into a limitless immensity of light, and of such living light! So living, so powerful, so active! It's marvelous. Then all the rest becomes so paltry, ugh!</p>

He told me, ‚ÄúYour... <em>(Mother tries to remember)</em> nervous subdegree‚Äù (I think), ‚Äúbetween the vital and the physical, isn't developed.‚Äù There's a padding, the consciousness doesn't go through.

Instead of asking for a precise time, you ask to remember, to remain conscious ‚Äì to remember what has happened. It can act. And also, as I have always said, not to wake up abruptly, that is, not to leap from one's bed, to stay quite still for a while.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-895"><em>A little later</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-896">There's a question I'd like to ask you in connection with the last aphorism.... You started saying that regardless of all the unnecessary overactivity of people, there was underneath that great current of irresistible Power <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DOING</span> things despite everything, despite people....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-897">So, what's your question?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-898"><em>But that great current of Power needs instruments in order to express itself, doesn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-899">A brain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-900"><em>But not just a brain, precisely. That Power can express itself, as</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 153</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-901"><em>in the past, in a mental or overmental way; it can express itself vitally through force; it can express itself through muscles; but how can it express itself physically (because you often speak of a ‚Äúmaterial power‚Äù), purely, directly? What's the difference between the Action up above and true Action here?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-902">Every time I have been conscious of the Power, the experience has been similar. The Will from above is expressed by a vibration, which certainly gets clothed in vital power but acts in a subtle physical. There is a perception of a certain quality of vibration, which is difficult to describe but gives a sense of something coagulated (not broken up), something that feels denser than air, extremely homogeneous, with a golden luminosity, an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AWESOME</span> power of propulsion, and which expresses a certain will ‚Äì it doesn't have the nature of human will but more the nature of vision than that of thought: it's like a vision imposing itself in order to be realized, in a domain very close to material Matter, but invisible except to the inner vision. And That, that Vibration, exerts a pressure on people, on things, on circumstances, in order to fashion them according to its vision. And it's irresistible. Even people who think the opposite, who want the opposite, do what is willed without wanting it; even things that are opposed in their very nature are turned around.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-903">For national events, relations between nations, terrestrial circumstances, that's how it acts, constantly, constantly, like an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AWESOME</span> Power. So then, if you are yourself in a state of union with the divine Will, without the thought and all the conceptions and ideas interfering, you follow, see, and know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-904">The resistance of inertia in consciousnesses and in Matter are the reason why that Action, instead of being direct and perfectly harmonious, becomes confused, full of contradictions, shocks and conflicts. Instead of everything working out ‚Äúnormally,‚Äù I might say, smoothly (as it should), all that resisting, opposing inertia causes things to start clashing together in a tangled movement, with disorder and destruction, which are made necessary only by the resistance but were <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> indispensable: they might not have been ‚Äì they should not have been, to tell the truth. Because that Will, that Power, is a Power of perfect harmony in which each thing is in its place, and It organizes everything wonderfully: It comes as an absolutely luminous and perfect organization, which you can see when you have the vision. But when It descends and presses down on Matter, everything starts seething and resisting.
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 154</p>
<p class="PE"> So to want to ascribe to the divine Action and the divine Power the disorder and confusion and destruction is yet more human nonsense. It's inertia (not to speak of ill will), it's inertia that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAUSES</span> the catastrophe. It isn't that the catastrophe is willed, or even that it's foreseen: it is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAUSED</span> by the resistance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-905">Then, added to this is the vision of the action of the Grace that comes and mitigates the results wherever possible, that is to say, wherever it's accepted. And that's what explains that the aspiration, the faith, the complete trust of the human, terrestrial element, have a power of harmonization, because they allow the Grace to come and mend the consequences of blind resistance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-906">It's a clear, very clear vision, clear even in the details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-907">If one wanted to, one could prophesy by telling what one sees. But there is a sort of supercompassion preventing that prophecy, because the Word of Truth has a power of manifestation, and to express the result of resistance would make that state more concrete and would lessen the action of the Grace. That's why even when one sees, one cannot speak, one <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST NOT</span> speak.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-908">But Sri Aurobindo certainly meant that this Power or this Force is what does everything ‚Äì everything. When you see It or are one with It, at the same time you know, and you know that That is the only thing that really acts and creates; the rest is the result of the field or the world or the matter or the substance in which It acts ‚Äì it's the result of resistance, but it's not the Action. And to unite with That means that you unite with the Action; to unite with what's below means that you unite with the resistance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-909">So then, because they fidget, stir, bustle, want to do this and that, think, make plans... they imagine they're doing something (!) ‚Äì they just resist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-910">Later, a little later, I'll be able to give examples for very small things, showing how the Force acts, and what interferes and mixes in, or what is driven by that Force but distorts its movement, and the result, that is to say, the physical appearance as we see it. Even an example for a very small thing without any world importance gives a clear notion of the way in which everything occurs and is distorted here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-911">For everything, everything, all the time, all the time, that's how it is. And when you do the yoga of the cells, you realize it's the same thing: there is the action of the Force acting, and then... <em>(Mother laughs)</em> what the body does with that Action!</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 155</p>
<p class="PE"> There immediately comes the why and the how. But that belongs to the realm of mental curiosity, because the important fact is to put a stop to the resistance. That's the important thing, putting a stop to the resistance so the universe may become what it must be: the expression of a harmonious, luminous, marvelous power, incomparably beautiful. Afterwards, once the resistance has ceased, if out of curiosity we want to know why it occurred... it will no longer matter. But right now, it's not by looking for the why that we will be able to bring about the remedy: it's by taking the true position. That's the only thing that matters.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-912">Putting a stop to the resistance through complete surrender, complete self-giving, in all the cells if one can do it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-913">They are beginning to have that intense joy of being only through the Lord, for the Lord, in the Lord....</p>

When That had left, there was a sort of suffocation. Then the Command came, with the rigidity of a wall: ‚ÄúNo fuss, you must prepare yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-924">Then you return to your senses, and it all seems so... oh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-925">There is the certitude ‚Äì the certitude based on experience ‚Äì that when That is here, it will be...

<p class="p-num">Page 157</p>
<p class="PE"> doesn't have that concrete reality. When you have the experiences up above, you live up above and everything appears lackluster and useless in comparison, but even that appears vague in comparison with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HERE</span>. This is truly why the world was created: it's to add to that essential Consciousness something so concrete and so solid, so real, and with such tremendous power!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-926">Only, to the body consciousness it seems long. Up above, of course, there is a smile, but for the body... And strangely enough, there isn't in the body that joy of the memory of the experience. You have the joy of the memory of the experiences up above, but here, it's not like that! It's not that. The body might say, ‚ÄúIt's no use for me to remember: I want to have the thing.‚Äù Because wherever the mind comes in, the memory is charming, but here, it's not like that. It's not like that: on the contrary, it intensifies the need to be, the aspiration, the need. And life looks like something so stupid, false, artificial, meaningless, without... ‚ÄúWhat's all this nonsense we constantly live in!‚Äù And yet, when That was there, nothing was destroyed, everything remained, but it was something else altogether.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-927">Later... <em>(Mother seems about to say something, then stops her self)</em>... later.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-928">No, it has made me understand something, but it's something very (how can I put it?), very intimate.... When Sri Aurobindo left, I knew I had to cut the link with the psychic being, otherwise I would have gone with him; and as I had promised him I would stay on and do the work, I had to do that: I literally closed the door on the psychic and said, ‚ÄúFor the moment this doesn't exist anymore.‚Äù It remained like that for ten years. After ten years, it slowly, slowly began to open again ‚Äì it was frightening. But I was ready. It began to open again. But then, that experience surprised me when I had it; I wondered why it had been like that, why I had received that command and had to do it. And when there was in the body that identification with divine Love [a few days ago], after that had left, the cells were ordered to undergo a similar phenomenon [to what happened after Sri Aurobindo's departure]. And I understood why the whole material world is closed: it's to allow it to exist <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WITHOUT</span> the experience [of divine Love]. Naturally, I had understood why I was made to close off my psychic, because... because it was truly impossible, I couldn't go on existing outwardly without Sri Aurobindo's presence. Well then, the cells have understood that they must go on existing and living their life without the presence of divine Love. And that's how it took place in the
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 158</p>
<p class="PE"> world: it was a necessary phenomenon for the formation and development of the material world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-929">But we're perhaps nearing... We are nearing the time when it will be allowed to open again.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-930">You remember, I don't know if it was in a letter or an article, Sri Aurobindo spoke of the manifestation of divine Love; he said, ‚ÄúTruth will have to be established first, otherwise there will be catastrophes....‚Äù I understand that very well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-931">But it's a long time in coming! <em>(Mother laughs)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-932">Up above, nothing is long. But anyway, it's here that we are ordered to exist and to achieve.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-933">It's on this occasion, too, that I had an answer regarding death. I was told, ‚ÄúBut they all want to die! Because they don't have the courage to be before That is manifested.‚Äù And I saw ‚Äì I clearly saw it was like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-934">The power of Death is that they all want to die! Not like that in their active thought, but in the body's deep feeling, because it doesn't have the courage to be without That ‚Äì it takes great courage.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-935">So they began with a complete ignorance and general stupidity, participating in all that this life is outwardly (as if it were something wonderful!). But as soon as they begin to grow a little wiser, it stops being wonderful. It's like what I said about this flower [the lotus]: when you know how to look at a flower, at the so spontaneous and, oh, uncomplicated expression of this marvelous Love, then you understand how long the way is ‚Äì all these attachments, all this importance we give to useless things, whereas there should be a spontaneous and natural beauty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-936"><em>If the world understood too soon, nobody would want to stay on, basically! That's the point.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-937">Yes, exactly! That's the point.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-938">If they knew too soon, if they were able to see the opposition between what is and what must be, they wouldn't have the courage. One must... one must truly be heroic ‚Äì heroic. I assure you, I see these cells, they are heroic ‚Äì heroic. As for them, they don't ‚Äúknow‚Äù in that mental way: it's only their adoration that saves them. That is, ‚ÄúWhat You will, Lord, what You will, what You will ...,‚Äù with the simplicity of a child's ingenuous heart: ‚ÄúWhat You will, what You will, what You will... only what You will and nothing but
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 159</p>
<p class="PE"> what You will exists.‚Äù Then it's all right. But without that, it's not possible. It's not possible to know what they know and to continue to be if That isn't there. You know, the feeling is, ‚ÄúAt Your service, what You will, what You will... whatever You will ...,‚Äù without discussion, without anything, without even a sensation, nothing: ‚ÄúWhat You will, what You will....‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-939">This is the only strength, there is no other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-940">Well, some have to do it, don't they! Otherwise it would never get done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-941">And at that moment<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="43" href="#">1</a> (it was a rather difficult moment), there was even in the consciousness... it was like a sword of white light that nothing can shake and which gave the cells the sensation, ‚ÄúWhat! But you should be in an ecstasy of joy, now that you know what will be‚Äù ‚Äì what there <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span>, in principle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-942">But it has caused a sort of detachment from the gestures, the outside, as if life weren't quite real ‚Äì yet real at the same time, but the Reality isn't there.... There is the sense of the Presence; that's constant. And that's a good thing to begin with, it strongly counterbalances the sense and perception of all the Distortion. There is even an insistence from this Presence for That alone to exist and to increasingly reduce the reality of the perception of what must not be. There will be a great strength in the being when the perception of what must not be is dimmed, erased as something far away and nonexistent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-943">That's what is being prepared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-944">What makes the work a little more complicated is that it isn't limited to this <em>(Mother's body)</em>, it's everything, everything around... and to a rather considerable distance. Because the contact in thought is almost perfectly established: it's impossible for someone to think [of Mother] without there being a response in the consciousness ‚Äì a response, a perception. So, imagine what it is... It's rather vast and rather complicated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-945">And there are kinds of rungs or stages ‚Äì stages in the response of the consciousness; rungs and stages according to the degree of development and consciousness. It makes for, oh, not an immensity, but still a rather extensive world. In this perception, the earth isn't very large.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-946">And there is a precision in details for tiny things, like what goes on in an individual's consciousness, for instance, or the response to certain events. It's very, very precise. But there is always a ban

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-973">What I...?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-974"><em>What you are doing.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-975">I am making discoveries, mon petit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-976">When the mind is active, or rather, as long as the mind is active, when you have dedicated your life and are fully convinced that it's your only raison d'√™tre, you tend to imagine that if you work for the Divine, the whole being participates, and if you aspire to progress, the whole being participates. You are satisfied once all contradiction has disappeared either in the vital or in the mind, and once everything is in agreement and harmonious. You think you have won a victory. But then, now... now that it's the cells of the body that want and aspire, they have been forced to note that suffering, difficulty, opposition, complication, all that is only to make them be wholly, completely, totally and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANTLY</span> in their aspiration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-977">It's extremely interesting, really very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-978">I told you last time about those moments I had, which really were moments of realization [of divine Love]; then I clearly saw that it went away because ‚Äúit‚Äù couldn't stay, and I immediately wanted to know why it couldn't stay. To just say, ‚ÄúThings aren't ready... things aren't ready,‚Äù is quite meaningless. Then the cells themselves observed a sort of... it's something between torpor, drowsiness, numbness and indifference; and that state is mistaken for peace, quietude and acceptance, but it really is... it really is a form of 
tamas.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="44" href="#">1</a> And that's the reason why it may last for what, to our consciousness, is almost an eternity. And there was, as I told you, an experience [a painful attack]; it recurred in another form
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 166</p>
<p class="PE"> (it never recurs in the same form), in another form, and then the cells noticed that that sort of intensity, of ardor of will taking hold of them, that something concrete in the self-giving, in the <em>surrender</em>, does not exist when everything is fine (what people are in the habit of calling ‚Äúeverything is fine,‚Äù which means that you don't feel your body, there is no difficulty and things are just getting along).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-979">It was almost a disappointment for these cells, which thought they were very ardent (!) and have had to realize that that semi-drowsiness was entirely responsible for all that's habitually called ‚Äúillnesses‚Äù ‚Äì but I don't believe in ‚Äúillnesses‚Äù anymore. I believe in them less and less. Everything that comes is a particular form of disorder, resistance, incomprehension or incapacity ‚Äì it all belongs to the domain of resistance. And there isn't really a deliberate resistance [in Mother's cells], I mean, what's conventionally called bad will (I hope this is true! If there is any, they haven't become aware of it yet), but those things come as keen indications of the different points [of work or resistance in Mother's body], so it results in what's called pains, or a sense of disorder, or a discomfort. (A discomfort, that is to say, a sense of disorder or disharmony, is much harder to bear than a sharp pain, much harder; it's like something that starts grating and gets stuck and can't get back into place.) All that, in the ordinary consciousness or the ordinary human view, is what people call ‚Äúillnesses.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-980">There only remains the phenomenon of contagion (contagion of viruses or germs), but there, experience shows that phenomena of psychological disorder ‚Äì all psychological disorders ‚Äì appear to be, according to experience, of the same nature as the contagion of a contagious disease and of all viruses and germs (such as the plague, cholera and so on). There are psychological contagions of psychological states: states of revolt or violence, of anger <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AND DEPRESSION</span>, are contagious in the same manner, it's a similar phenomenon. Therefore, since it's a similar phenomenon, it can be mastered. It's simply a question of words: we call them ‚Äúillnesses‚Äù (but these [psychological contagions] can also be called illnesses) or we can call them any name we like, it's a question of words, that's all. But it's similar, it's the same thing: it's an opening to disorder or an opening to revolt. We can call it what we like. Only, it's in a different field of vibrations. But the character is identical.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-981">And then, what discoveries I make! Extraordinary discoveries: how every experience always has an obverse and a reverse. For instance, the calm of a vision that's vast enough not to be disturbed
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 167</p>
<p class="PE"> by tiny infinitesimal points and is (I was about to say ‚Äúseems to be,‚Äù but it doesn't seem to be: it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span>) the result of a growth of consciousness and of an identification with the higher regions, and at the same time that apparent insensitiveness that looks like the negation of divine compassion; there comes a point when you see both as having become true and being able to exist not simultaneously but as <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> thing. As recently as the day before yesterday, I had the perfectly concrete experience of an extremely intense wave of divine Compassion [in the face of one of those ‚Äúpsychological contagions‚Äù], and I had the opportunity to observe how, if this Compassion is allowed to manifest on a certain plane, it becomes an emotion that may disturb or trouble the imperturbable calm; but if it manifests (they aren't the same ‚Äúplanes‚Äù: there are imperceptible nuances), if it manifests in its essential truth, it retains all its power of action, of effective help, and it in no way changes the imperturbable calm of the eternal vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-982">All those are experiences of nuances (or nuances of experiences, I don't know how to put it) that become necessary and concrete only in the physical consciousness. And then, it results in a perfection of realization ‚Äì a perfection in the minutes' detail ‚Äì which none of those realizations have in the higher realms. I am learning what the physical realization contributes in terms of concreteness, accuracy and perfection in the Realization; and how all those experiences interpenetrate, combine with each other, complement each other ‚Äì it's wonderful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-983">At the same time, I am little by little learning from demonstration the true use that must be made of mental activity. Its purpose is easy to understand: it has been used to educate, awaken and so on; but it's not something that after having done its duty and fulfilled its purpose will disappear. It will be used in its own manner, but in its true manner and true place. And it becomes wonderfully interesting.... For instance, the idea that you are what you think, that your knowledge is your power, well, it seems to be a necessity of the transition, of the passage from one state of consciousness to another, but it's not, as I said, something that will disappear when something else is reached: it will be used, but in its own place. Because when you experience union, the mind appears unnecessary: the direct contact, the direct action, do without it. But in its true place, acting in the true way, sticking to its place (a place not of necessity or even usefulness, but of refinement in action), it becomes quite interesting. When you see the Whole as a growing self-awareness, the mind enriches ‚Äì it enriches
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 168</p>
<p class="PE"> the Whole. And when each thing is in its own place, it all becomes so harmonious and simple, but with such full and complete and perfect simplicity that everything is used.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-984">And with all this, there is (it almost seems to be the key to the problem, to the understanding), there is a special concentration on the why, the how of death.... Years and years ago, when Sri Aurobindo was still here, there came one day a sort of dazzling, imperious revelation: ‚ÄúOne dies only when one chooses to die.‚Äù I told Sri Aurobindo, ‚ÄúThis is what I saw and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNEW</span>.‚Äù He said to me, ‚ÄúIt is true.‚Äù Then I asked him, ‚ÄúAlways, in every case?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúAlways.‚Äù Only, one isn't conscious, human beings aren't conscious, but that's how it is. But now I am beginning to understand! Some experiences, some examples are given in the details of the body's inner vibrations, and I see that there is a choice, a choice generally unconscious, but which, in some individuals, can be conscious. I am not talking about sentimental cases, I am talking about the body, the cells accepting disintegration. There is a will like this <em>(Mother raises a finger upward)</em> or a will like that <em>(Mother lowers her finger)</em>. The origin of that will lies in the truth of the being, but it seems (and that is something marvelous), it seems that the final decision is left to the choice of the cells themselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-985">I am not at all referring to the physical, vital, psychic consciousnesses, not to any of that: I am referring to the consciousness of the cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-986">That's how the present moment is: the will may be like this <em>(Mother raises a finger upward)</em>, or it may be like that <em>(finger downward)</em>. Like that, it means dissolution; like this, it means continuation and progress ‚Äì continuation with the necessity of progress. There is something which is the consciousness of the cells (a consciousness that observes, and which, when it is awakened, is a wonderful witness), and that consciousness is the one which goes like this <em>(same gesture)</em> or like that. This is expressed by a will to endure or to last, or by a need for the annihilation of rest. And then, when these cells are full of that light ‚Äì that golden light, that splendor of divine Love ‚Äì there is a sort of thirst, a need to participate in That, which takes away all that is or can be difficult in the endurance: that disappears, it becomes a glory. Then...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-987">That's what is being learned.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-988">But to be able to observe (this is something being worked out on a parallel line), to observe exactly what goes on in this cellular
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 169</p>
<p class="PE"> realm, one must be perfectly free from and independent of other human beings' influence. And this is extremely difficult because of that habit of mixture.... It's the sensitiveness of the cells which has difficulty. So constant care must be taken to fasten all that sensitiveness on to the aspiration for the Supreme alone; that's the only way, the solution. You have to do that constantly, every time you feel the influence of others' contact. In ordinary life, of course, to get rid of influences you cut off the contact; well, that movement of withdrawal, recoil, isolation, all those psychological movements (through material isolation in the physical; in the vital, in the psychic, in the mind, everywhere, it always consists in cutting oneself off, in separating oneself), all that is false; it's contrary to the truth. The truth is to... <em>(outspread gesture)</em> to feel the union. And yet, for the cellular work of cellular transformation, an isolation must be reached that isn't a contradiction of the essential unity. And that's a little difficult; it makes for a very delicate, very painstaking, very microscopic work which somewhat complicates matters. But it's possible, for instance, to touch someone, to take someone's hand, and for union to be achieved only in the deeper truth, while outwardly there is just a bringing together of cells.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1096">I gave you a very long speech quite early this morning: you were sleeping. Didn't you hear?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1097"><em>What did you tell me!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1098">Oh, it was very long....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1099">It wasn't personal. I told you how the true movement gets distorted, and I gave you examples. Very interesting examples because they don't look like much, but it's something fundamental, in the sense that that's how Truth is turned into falsehood. And it's so subtle that unless one has experienced it, mentally one cannot understand. What I explained to you was the experience, and there were two examples, which I told you in a very precise way... now I don't remember the words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1100"><em>You don't remember?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1101">The words were of the kind that come ready-made, like that; so if now I try to remember, that's not it anymore. When it comes, I'll tell you.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 184</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1102"><em>I've often had the experience (on another plane, I suppose) that the current inexplicably seemed to be reversed: things stop being harmonious, and there's no knowing why.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1103">The why is very simple: it's always separation ‚Äì the individual separating himself, always. So, according to everyone's nature, there is more or less egoism, but there is separation. Now I see the false movement: it's when the consciousness falls back into an old habit. And as it's an old habit ‚Äì very old habit ‚Äì you don't feel it as a fall: it's a tiny little movement like this <em>(Mother twists something between her thumb and index finger)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1104">I know ‚Äì this morning, it was very clear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1105">You see, everything is the Supreme's action to hasten the return of the individual consciousness to the Consciousness ‚Äì the supreme Consciousness; so then, through the individual (I don't know if you'll be able to follow), the pressure of the Force to be accepted is turned into a will to make itself understood. That's the distortion. And you see, it's extremely subtle. But by ‚Äúwill,‚Äù I mean a will in the human way, you understand. The pressure of the Force <em>(Mother lays her right hand flat on top of her left hand)</em> to make itself understood by the consciousness <em>(the left hand below)</em>, the pressure of the Force on the consciousness to transform it is turned in the intermediary individual into a will to make itself understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1106">Another thing. There is instinctively, that is to say, almost subconsciously, almost involuntarily, not a will or an anxiety, or even a curiosity, but a sort of habit of observation: the habit of observing the effect produced on others (it's not bluntly what they think or feel, their opinion; it's not as blunt as that because as soon as it assumes that proportion it makes one smile). It's a sort of habit, a habit of looking at every circumstance not only as you see it, but, at the same time, as, let's say, others see it. It's not an ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù but you take it into account; you take it into account not for its result, but you automatically take it into account in the reaction of the consciousness: what others feel, think, their reactions; not exactly their opinion, but the feeling of their reaction. It's a sort of habit. And that is the fallacious distortion of the sense of Oneness. Of course, we are all <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span>, and in the distorted consciousness this oneness is translated as a noticing, an observation (I am not referring to those who are concerned with themselves and for whom it's important, that's not what I mean: it's in the functioning of the consciousness). And that movement of observation has a place,
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 185</p>
<p class="PE"> but in this form, it's not a true place. So then, it's so subtle.... There is the sense of Oneness, that every movement of the consciousness has repercussions everywhere, in all consciousnesses because there is only one consciousness, and the distortions are different; it's the distortions that make for diversity.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1107">Yet another thing. There is an intense and constant aspiration for Union. It always begins with self-giving ‚Äì the spontaneous self-giving to the Supreme. But then, there is, mixed into it... (how can I express it?) the expectation (is it an expectation? It's almost just a noticing)... it's not an anxiety for, but rather an <em>expectation</em>, yes, of the result. In other words, in that great will and aspiration for the manifestation of Harmony, of Love in the Truth, in that thirst of the whole, entire being for That which is the source of that Harmony, to the movement of aspiration is added the perception (it's more than the perception: it's the expectation), the expectation of the result, and then, it gets warped <em>(same twisting gesture)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1108">And what I am saying now isn't at all something I see, it's something I lived during my morning walk at 4:30. There were different successive experiences [which Mother has just described], and then, a very clear, very keen perception of the point at which the true experience <em>(same twisting gesture)</em> gets falsified. And it's not something violent, there's nothing dramatic to it, nothing at all, but... it's clearly the difference between the Infinite and Eternal, the All-Powerful [being turned] into the individuality ‚Äì the individual limitation. And for the ordinary consciousness, the usual consciousness ‚Äì that is to say, the limited, individual consciousness ‚Äì that experience itself is marvelous, but you are the ‚Äúrecipient,‚Äù you are ‚Äúthe one who experiences.‚Äù That's the point, it's the difference between the [pure] experience and, all of a sudden, ‚Äúthe one who experiences.‚Äù And then, with that ‚Äúthe one who experiences,‚Äù it's over, everything is distorted. Everything is distorted, but not dramatically, you understand, not like that, no. It's the difference between Truth and falsehood. It's a falsehood (how can I explain?)... it's the difference between life and death; it's the difference between Reality and illusion. And the one <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span>, while the other... remembers having been, or is a witness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1109">It's very subtle, really very subtle. But it's immense ‚Äì immense and total.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 186</p>
<p class="PE"> This body lived the Truth this morning several times for a few seconds (which might have been eternities). But it's obvious that if everything were ready for ‚Äúthat‚Äù to be established, it would mean omnipotence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1110">There was so clear an explanation ‚Äì obvious, tangible ‚Äì showing how it happens all the time ‚Äì all the time, all the time, everywhere. And unless one experiences it, there's no way one can even understand the difference; all words are approximations. But just when it is true... <em>(Mother smiles blissfully)</em>... And then, one doesn't know if it lasted or if it doesn't last: all that has disappeared. And it doesn't abolish anything, that's the most wonderful part! Everything is there, nothing is abolished. It's only a phenomenon of consciousness. Because at such a time, everything that is becomes true, so... I mean it abolishes nothing of the Manifestation; you don't even feel that Falsehood is abolished: it doesn't exist, it isn't. Everything can remain exactly as it is; it becomes only a question of choice. Everything becomes a question of choice: you choose this way, choose that way.... And in a splendor of joy, of beauty, of harmony, a plenitude of luminous consciousness in which there is no darkness anymore: it no longer exists. And it truly is, so to say, the choice between life and death, consciousness and unconsciousness (‚Äúunconsciousness‚Äù isn't what we call unconsciousness, the unconsciousness of the stone, it's not that). One doesn't know what consciousness is until one has experienced ‚Äúthat.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1111">If it could be translated into words, it would be so pretty (that's when I understand poets!). That ineffable Presence seems to be saying, ‚ÄúYou see, I was always there, and you didn't know it.‚Äù And it's lived at the very heart of the cells: ‚ÄúYou see, you know that I was always there, but you didn't know it.‚Äù And then... <em>(Mother smiles on in a contemplation)</em>... It's a tiny nothing ‚Äì which changes everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1112">That's how a dead man can come back to life. That's how: through that change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1113">The mind dramatizes, and that's why it cannot understand. Of course, it has been useful to refine Matter, to make it more supple, to prepare things ‚Äì to make Life more supple and refine Matter. But it has a taste for drama, and that's why it doesn't understand. Violent emotions, complications are its game, its amusement. Probably because it needed them. But one must really leave that aside when the time comes, when one is ready for the experience.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 187</p>
<p class="PE"> And immediately after that, the certitude ‚Äì so peaceful ‚Äì that everything was necessary ‚Äì everything, but everything: from the most marvelous for the human consciousness to the most horrible, the most repulsive ‚Äì everything was necessary. But strangely, all those things, all those experiences, all that life is what becomes unreal ‚Äì unreal, worse than an act you put on for yourself: unreal. And it is in its unreality that it was necessary for the consciousness. All appreciations are purely human ‚Äì purely human because they alter the measure, the proportion. Even physical suffering, material suffering, which is one of the things most difficult to feel as illusory: a lamentable act you put on for yourself, for the cells. And I am speaking from experience, with convincing examples. It's very interesting.</p>

There is a shape, you see a shape, the shape of a man; you see it and it isn't naked. It's already the third time this has happened to me. But it happened with people who had gone out of their bodies; Purani, for instance, I saw him like that: he wasn't naked, yet he didn't wear any clothes, and you could see the shape of a body, it was blue and pink (I told you, I think). Well, just now, I saw a man, the shape of a man (who resembled you, by the way), climbing up a hill, and he wasn't naked, yet he didn't wear any clothes.... Which means they have a sort of clothing of light. But it doesn't give the impression of a radiating light or anything of that kind. It's like an atmosphere.

<p class="PE"> showing how nations (men taken as nations) have acted and are increasingly acting in a growing Falsehood, and how they have used all their creative power to create such formidable means of destruction, with, at the back of their minds, the really childish notion that the destruction would be so terrible that no one would want to use them. But they don't know (they ought to know, but they don't) that things have a consciousness and a force of manifestation, and that all those means of destruction are pressing to be used; and even though men may not want to use them, a force stronger than they will be pushing them to do so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1225">Then, seeing all this, the imminence of the catastrophe, there was a sort of call or aspiration to bring down something that could at least neutralize that error. And it came, an answer... I can't say I heard it with my ears, but it was so clear, so strong and precise that it was indisputable. I am obliged to translate it into words; if I translate it into words, I may say something like this: ‚ÄúThat's why you have created Auroville.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1226">And with the clear vision that Auroville was a center of force and creation, with... (how can I explain?) a seed of truth, and that if it could sprout and develop, the very movement of its growth would be a reaction against the catastrophic consequences of the error of armament.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1227">I found this very interesting because this birth of Auroville wasn't preceded by any thought; as always, it was simply a Force acting, like a sort of absolute manifesting, and it was so strong [when the idea of Auroville presented itself to Mother] that I could have told people, ‚ÄúEven if you don't believe in it, even if all circumstances appear to be quite unfavorable, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">I KNOW THAT AUROVILLE WILL BE</span>. It may be in a hundred years, it may be in a thousand years, I don't know, but Auroville will be, because it has been decreed.‚Äù So it was decreed ‚Äì and done quite simply, like that, in obedience to a Command, without any thought. And when I was told that (I say, ‚ÄúI was told,‚Äù but you understand what I mean), when I was told that, it was to tell me, ‚ÄúHere is why you have made Auroville; you are unaware of it, but that's why....‚Äù Because it was the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LAST HOPE</span> to react against the imminent catastrophe. If some interest is awakened in all countries for this creation, little by little it will have the power to react against the error they have committed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1228">I found this very interesting, because I had never thought about it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1229">And naturally, when I was shown that, I understood; I perceived
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 206</p>
<p class="PE"> how the creation of Auroville has an action in the invisible, and what action. It's not a material, outward action: it's an action in the invisible. And since then, I have been trying to make countries understand it, of course not outwardly because they all think they're much too clever to be taught anything, but inwardly, in the invisible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1230">It's fairly recent, it dates from two or three days ago. I had never been told this. It was said very clearly ‚Äì ‚Äúsaid,‚Äù I mean seen, shown like this <em>(gesture of a scene offered to the sight)</em>. So my interest in Auroville has considerably increased since then. Because I have understood that it isn't just a creation of idealism, but quite a practical phenomenon, in the hope... in the will, rather, to thwart and counterbalance the effects ‚Äì the frightful effects ‚Äì of the psychological error of believing that fear can save you from a danger! Fear attracts the danger much more than it saves you from it. And all these countries, all these governments commit blunder upon blunder because of that fear of the catastrophe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1231">All this is simply to tell you that if nations collaborate in the work of Auroville, even to a very modest extent [such as this offer of money from the French government], it will do them good ‚Äì it can do them a lot of good, a good that can be out of proportion to the appearance of their actions.</p>

It's not when Auroville is ready ‚Äì when Auroville is ready, it will be one town among all other towns and it's only its own capacity of truth that will have power, but that... remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1234">No, the point is a combined interest in building something founded on the Truth. They have had a combined interest (combined without any mutual liking, of course) in creating a power of destruction built on Falsehood; well, Auroville means diverting a little of that force (the quantity is minor, but the quality is superior).

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1247">Now I know, I remember, this whole experience came after I saw a book that was published quite recently in India, in English, which they entitled <em>The Roll of Honour</em>, and in which there is a photo and a short biography of all those who died in the fight against the British, for India's freedom. There were photos everywhere, lots of them (some were only photos the police took after they had just been killed and were lying on the ground). And it all brought a certain atmosphere: the atmosphere of those disinterested goodwilled people who meet with a tragic fate. It had the same impression on me as the horrors of the Germans during the war over there. These things are obviously under the direct influence of certain adverse forces, but we know that the adverse forces are, so to say, permitted to work ‚Äì through the sense of horror, in fact ‚Äì in order to hasten the awakening of consciousness. So then, that experience, which was very strong and was very like the one I had when I saw the photographs of German atrocities in France, put me in contact with the vision of the human, terrestrial, modern error (it's modern: it began these last one thousand years and has become more and more acute in the last hundred years), with the aspiration to counterbalance that: How to do it?... What is to be done?... And the answer: ‚ÄúThat's why you have created Auroville.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1248">There is a perception of forces ‚Äì the forces that act directly in events, material events, which are... illusory and deceptive. For instance, the man who fought for his country's freedom, who has just been assassinated because he is a rebel, and who looks defeated, lying there on the edge of the road ‚Äì he is the real victor. That's how it is, it clearly shows the kind of relationship between the truth and the expression. Then, if you enter the consciousness in which you perceive the play of forces and see the world in that light, it's very interesting. And that's how, when I was in that state, I was told, clearly shown (it's inexpressible because it isn't with words, but these are facts): ‚ÄúThat's why you have created Auroville....‚Äù It's the same thing as with that

It is too easy to forget, deny, minimize other's suffering. I can no longer put up with it. I no longer want to shut my eyes and comfort myself till the next time.... What should I undertake?...‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1270">When did you get this letter?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1271"><em>Two or three days ago.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1272">But did you decide to read it to me yesterday? Because the whole day I was in that frame of mind (not with these words, but</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 213</p>
<p class="PE"> in that frame of mind).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1273">For a long time lately, that is, for days and days, there has been a very sharp perception, very intense and clear, that the action of the Force outwardly results in what we call ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù because it's the only kind of vibration capable of pulling Matter out of inertia.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1274">Supreme Peace and Calm were distorted and disfigured into inertia and <em>tamas</em>, and precisely because it was the distortion of true Peace and Calm, there was no reason for it to change! A certain vibration of awakening ‚Äì of reawakening ‚Äì was necessary to emerge from that tamas, which was incapable of directly changing from tamas into Peace; something was needed to shake the tamas, and outwardly it resulted in suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1275">I am referring here to physical suffering, because all the other kinds of suffering ‚Äì vital, mental, emotive suffering ‚Äì arise from a wrong functioning of the mind, and those... we can easily rank them in the Falsehood, that's all. But physical suffering is to me like a child being beaten, because here in Matter, Falsehood turned into ignorance, which means there is no bad will ‚Äì there is no bad will in Matter, everything is inertia and ignorance: total ignorance of the Truth, ignorance of the Origin, ignorance of the Possibility, even ignorance of what needs to be done so as not to suffer materially. This ignorance is everywhere in the cells, and only the experience ‚Äì and the experience of what, in this rudimentary consciousness, is translated as suffering ‚Äì can awaken, arouse the need to know and be cured, and the aspiration to be transformed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1276">This has become a certitude because the aspiration has been born in all these cells, and it's growing more and more intense and is surprised at the resistance. But they have observed that when something is upset in the functioning (which means that instead of being supple, spontaneous, natural, the functioning becomes a painful effort, a struggle with something that takes on the appearance of a bad will but is only a reluctance devoid of understanding), at such times the intensity of the aspiration, of the call, grows tenfold: it becomes constant. The difficulty is to keep up this state of intensity; generally it all falls back into, I can't say ‚Äúdrowsiness,‚Äù but it's a sort of slackening: you take things easy. And it's only when the inner disorder becomes hard to bear that the intensity grows and becomes permanent. For hours ‚Äì hours ‚Äì without flagging, the call, the aspiration, the will to unite with the Divine, to become the Divine, is kept up at its peak ‚Äì why? Because there was what's outwardly called a physical disorder, a suffering.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 214</p>
<p class="PE"> Otherwise, when there isn't any suffering, there is now and then an upsurge, then it flags and falls back; then at some other time, another upsurge... It never ends! It lasts for eternities. If we want things to go fast (fast relatively to the rhythm of our lives), the whiplash is necessary. I am convinced of this, because as soon as you are in your inner being, you treat this with contempt (for yourself).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1277">But then, when that true Compassion of divine Love comes and you see all those things that look so horrible, so abnormal, so absurd, that great pain over all beings and even over things... Then there was born in this physical being the aspiration to relieve, to cure, to make all that disappear. There is something in Love in its Origin that is constantly expressed by the intervention of the Grace; a force, a sweetness, something like a vibration of solace, spread everywhere, but which an enlightened consciousness can direct, concentrate on certain points. And that's just where I saw the true use one could make of thought: thought is used as a channel to carry the vibration from place to place, wherever it's necessary. This force, this vibration of sweetness is there over the world in a static way, pressing to be received, but it's an impersonal action, and thought ‚Äì enlightened thought, surrendered thought, the thought that is nothing more than an instrument, that no longer tries to set things in motion, that is satisfied with being moved by the higher Consciousness ‚Äì thought is used as an intermediary to make contact, to build a connection and allow this impersonal Force to act wherever it's necessary, on precise points.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1278">We may say in an absolute way that the remedy always goes together with the trouble. We could say that the cure for every suffering coexists with the suffering. Then, instead of seeing an ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù and ‚Äústupid‚Äù trouble, as people generally think, you see that the progress, the evolution which made the suffering necessary ‚Äì which is the cause and the goal of the suffering ‚Äì achieves the desired result, and at the same time the suffering is cured, for those who can open up and receive. The three things ‚Äì the suffering as a means of progress, the progress, and the cure of the suffering ‚Äì are coexistent, simultaneous, meaning that they don't follow one another, they take place at the same time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1279">If, when the transformative action creates a suffering, there is in what suffers the necessary aspiration and opening, the remedy</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 215</p>
<p class="PE"> is absorbed at the same time, and the effect is total, complete: the transformation, along with the action necessary to obtain it, and at the same time the cure of the false sensation caused by the resistance. And the suffering is replaced by... something unknown on this earth, but which has to do with joy, ease, trust, and security. It's a supersensation, in perfect peace, and clearly the only thing that can be eternal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1280">This analysis expresses very imperfectly what we could call the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù of the Ananda.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1281">I think it's something that has been felt, experienced (partially and very fleetingly) through all ages, but which is beginning to be concentrated and almost concretized on earth. But physical Matter in its cellular form has, we can't say a fear or an anxiety, but a sort of apprehension of new vibrations, and that apprehension naturally takes away from the cells their receptivity and takes on the appearance of a discomfort (it's not a suffering but a discomfort). But when that apprehension is counterbalanced and cured by aspiration and the will for total surrender and the act of total surrender, then that sort of apprehension having disappeared, there comes supreme ease.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1282">All this is like microscopic studies of the phenomena of consciousness independent of mental intervention. The need to use words to express ourselves brings in that mental intervention, but in the experience it doesn't exist. And it's very interesting because the pure experience holds a content of truth, of reality, which disappears as soon as the mind intervenes. There is a flavor of true reality which totally eludes expression for that reason. It's the same difference as between an individual and his portrait, between a fact and the story told about it. That's how it is. But it's far more subtle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1283">So then, to return to the letter, when you are conscious of this Force ‚Äì this Force, this Compassion in its essential reality ‚Äì and see how it can be exerted through a conscious individual, you have the key to the problem.</p>

Because in all the transition from plant to animal and from animal to man (especially from animal to man), the differences of form are, ultimately, minor: the true transformation is the intervention of another agent of consciousness. All the differences between the life of the animal and the life of man stem from the intervention of the Mind; but the substance is essentially the same and it obeys the same laws of formation and construction. There isn't much difference, for instance, between the calf being formed in a cow's womb and the child being formed in its mother's womb. There is one difference: that of the Mind's intervention. But if we envisage a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICAL</span> being, that is, as visible as the physical now is and with the same density, for instance a body that wouldn't need blood circulation and bones (especially these two things: the skeleton and blood circulation)... it's very hard to imagine.

<p class="PE">About the financial situation, I have a little story to tell you, which took place on Sunday or Monday. I told you that the situation was quite... to ordinary consciousnesses, it was critical. And there was a payment to be made. I don't remember the material details, but something had to be paid very urgently (I think it was to the workers: they were hungry and hadn't been given their money). And I needed a certain amount ‚Äì which I didn't have: I had nothing. Then a sort of compassion came into me for those people who didn't have any money. I saw it wasn't right, and I couldn't do anything because there was none. So, in the evening while I was walking (I have an hour of meditation and quiet, of concentration), I presented it all like this <em>(gesture upward)</em>, and with an almost childlike attitude I said to the Lord (He was there, of course, I was with Him) something that can be translated (I don't know, I don't speak but it could be translated into words) roughly like this: ‚ÄúI know You are with me and behind everything I do and everywhere, but I'd like to know whether what I do, the work I do, interests You or not! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> And if it does interest You, well, I must have this money.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1349">It came like that, in a quite childlike form, but very, very pure. And two days later, when it was necessary for the money to come, for me to have money, just as everything seemed quite impossible, Amrita suddenly came in, telling me, ‚ÄúHere, so-and-so has sent a cheque for such-and-such an amount.‚Äù ‚Äì Exactly the amount needed. And I think it was the first time that person had sent money. It was quite unexpected, absolutely a miracle ‚Äì a miracle for children. The required amount, just at the required time, and absolutely unexpected. Then I had a good laugh. And I said to myself, ‚ÄúHow silly we can be! We don't know that everything happens exactly as it has to.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1350">I can't say that I worry (I never do), but I was wondering... sometimes I wonder, ‚ÄúIs it going to go on, or...‚Äù I am not quite sure of what's going to happen, because... I never try to know nor do I desire to know, but I don't feel I am ‚Äútold.‚Äù (I think this is another mental stupidity and when nothing is formulated, it means things are all right and as they should be.) But, of course, there is a childishness that would like to be ‚Äútold,‚Äù ‚ÄúDo this this way and that that way, and this...‚Äù But it doesn't work! It's not like that!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1351">I don't receive any command: when I have something to say, I receive the exact word or sentence, in an absolute way; but for</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 228</p>
<p class="PE"> action, I don't receive any command, because... I don't think I have any hesitation, I never wonder, ‚ÄúShould I do this or should I do that?‚Äù Never. My whole effort is to live from minute to minute. I mean, to do every minute exactly what should be done, without making plans, without thinking, without... because it all becomes mental; as soon as you start thinking something out, that's no longer it. But quite instinctively and spontaneously, I do what needs to be done: this, that, this.... When something needs a response, it comes. As for money, it's the same thing; the only thing I am led to do is to say, ‚ÄúSo-and-so has asked for so much, such-and-such Service needs so much,‚Äù like that (not a long time in advance, but when it becomes imperative). And that's all. It's like that. So I don't know what will happen tomorrow; I don't at all seek to know what's going to happen. But on that day, I seemed to be asking, ‚ÄúWell, give me proof that You are interested.‚Äù ‚Äì Poff! it came just at the right time. So I laughed, I said to myself, ‚ÄúWhat a baby I must still be!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1352">And for two days, just when I needed to give some money, it came. So I said, ‚ÄúAll right, that's fine.‚Äù But now it's no longer so amusing! It was really amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1353">There is now a kind of trust there, behind: well, it will come when it has to, that's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1354">The spirit of organization, maybe not quite on an ordinary level but on a human one (maybe not just human, but anyway), the spirit of organization likes to have everything in front of it like a picture, and then to make plans, to organize, see: this comes here, that comes there.... All that is useless. We must learn to live from minute to minute, like that. It's much more comfortable. And what prevents things from being so is (I think) that it's exactly contrary to the reasonable human mind, and that everyone around me expects me to make plans and decisions and... So there is a pressure; I think that's it. Otherwise, it would naturally and spontaneously be like that: the miracle every minute. My tendency is always to say, ‚ÄúOh, don't worry! The more you worry, the more difficult you make things ‚Äì don't bother, don't bother.‚Äù But they stare at me with a kind of horror <em>(Mother laughs)</em>: I don't ‚Äúplan ahead,‚Äù you see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1355">That's my little ‚Äústory‚Äù ‚Äì my little miracle. It was as though to tell me, ‚ÄúOh, you'd like to see a miracle? ‚Äì Here it is, ready-made!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> It's a good lesson.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1368">How? ‚Äì Very simple. Because these are mere words. When you practice without believing in God or in the Divine, you practice to reach a perfection, to make progress, for all sorts of reasons.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1369">Are there many people... (I am not referring to those who have a religion: they learn a catechism when they are quite small, so it doesn't have much meaning), but taking people as they come, are there many of them who believe in the Divine?...

<p class="PE"> do it, I know people who did it; they had a family Kali in their home, they took her and threw her into the Ganges because they were displeased with her ‚Äì if you believe in the Divine, you can't do such things, can you?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1370">I don't know.... Belief in the Divine?... You thirst for a certain perfection, perhaps even to surpass yourself, to reach something higher than what is; when you are a philanthropist, you have an aspiration for mankind to be better, less unhappy and miserable, all kinds of things like that ‚Äì you can practice a yoga for that, but that's not believing. To believe is to have the faith that there cannot be a world without the Divine, that's what it is; the faith that the very existence of the world is proof of the Divine. And precisely not a ‚Äúbelief,‚Äù not something you thought over or were taught, none of all that: a faith. The faith which is a lived knowledge (not a learned knowledge) that the existence of the world is sufficient proof of the Divine ‚Äì without the Divine, no world. And it's so obvious, of course, that you feel one has to be a bit stupid to think otherwise! And the ‚ÄúDivine,‚Äù not in the sense of ‚Äúraison d'√™tre,‚Äù ‚Äúgoal,‚Äù ‚Äúculmination,‚Äù not all that: the world as it is is proof of the Divine.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1371">To me it's even stronger than that: when I look at a rose like the one I gave you, this thing which holds such a concentration of spontaneous beauty (not fabricated: a spontaneous beauty, a blossoming), you only have to see that and you're sure the Divine exists, it's a certitude. You can't disbelieve, it's impossible. It's like those people ‚Äì it's fantastic! ‚Äì those people who have studied Nature, studied really in depth how everything works and occurs and exists: how can they study sincerely, carefully and painstakingly without being absolutely convinced that the Divine is there?

A tranquillity that's more than peace, but it isn't inert immobility, I don't know how to express it. It absolutely gives the sense of a vibration of extreme intensity, but ab-so-lute-ly tranquil, tranquil, luminous, without... almost with a sense of motionlessness. And so limpid, so transparent!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1373">Whenever I remain outside action like that and you are here, that's always what comes, always.

<p class="PE"> had given that barbarous name of ‚Äúpathetism.‚Äù When one went beyond and entered those regions, then there was... it was the Supreme outside the creation, beyond the creation. That's where I saw the representative form of the new creation (and that was before I ever heard anything about Sri Aurobindo and the Supermind), that's where I saw the form that must succeed the human form, like the symbolic representation of the new creation. That was two or three years before I heard of Sri Aurobindo and met him. So when he told me about the supramental creation, I said to him <em>(laughing)</em>, ‚ÄúBut of course, I know, I saw it up there!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1376">No one had told me anything. It's only when I went to Tlemcen that Madame Th√©on told me what it was. She knew how to go through all the states of being, from one to the next, and on to the next... leaving the body corresponding to each state of being in its region and moving beyond. So then, quite spontaneously and naturally, I learned to do it. And I did it there, that's how I saw this prototype, all the way up, all the way up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1377">Th√©on's teaching wasn't at all metaphysical and intellectual: everything was expressed in a sort of pictorial objectification; and as I said the other day about that vision [of the ‚Äúbirds‚Äù], it's a richer expression, less limited than the purely intellectual and metaphysical expression. It's more alive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1378">And that's pleasant ‚Äì I like meditating with you. It's not ‚Äúmeditating,‚Äù it's a silent and very pleasant contemplation-concentration. That's why, when you are here, I sit without uttering a word!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1390">It didn't happen recently; I can't recall if it was last year or the year before, at the time of the puja.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1391"><em>You once told me that Durga had ‚Äúsurrendered.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1392">That's it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1393">She <em>surrendered</em>. That is to say, she was perfectly independent in her movements and didn't feel the need to depend on anyone, and that year... I don't remember if it was last year or the year before ‚Äì she used to come every year when I went downstairs for the puja darshan: I would go downstairs and she would come and stay there throughout all the pujas; since I came upstairs, we haven't been doing it anymore. But once, she came, and I told you what followed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1394">But it has made an enormous difference. People naturally didn't notice anything, no one, but it has made an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ENORMOUS</span> difference in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1395">I was still feeling it very strongly these last few days.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1396"><em>A difference, in what sense?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1397">All those who do the puja sincerely (sincerely, of course, not mechanically but with devotion) always attract an emanation or a representation, a representative form, which is present at the puja and responds: it responds to the puja. Every family that worships Kali, for instance, has its own Kali. And it's true, they are little entities that aren't quite independent, but have their own lives. And in Durga's case, it was very clear. So when I say it makes a big difference, it's because now, in a general way, all those representations of Durga are themselves also in a movement of collaboration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1398">Naturally, all those entities were more or less spontaneously doing the Supreme's work, but... (how can I explain it?) without their having a conscious will: they did it simply and spontaneously, because they were beings of harmony, working harmoniously. But now, in Durga's case it's very clear ‚Äì very clear: she is like this <em>(gesture turned upward, awaiting the Supreme's Command)</em>. In her relationship with the hostile beings, in her legendary yearly battle (which is of course symbolic), she is like this <em>(same gesture)</em>, eager to know the direction, the indication, the gesture to be made.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 236</p>
<p class="PE"> When Sri Aurobindo was here, every year at the time of Durga's battle, I used to receive from him the very clear indication of the aspect of the adverse forces that had to be vanquished and subdued. (It was very interesting, and I generally noted it down, but I don't know where all that has gone.) It went on like that for thirty years. And after his departure... there only remained the Supreme.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1399">She would come, she was absolutely present during the six days of <em>pranam</em> downstairs. But now, since... I don't know (I don't remember because for me time isn't quite clear anymore, it no longer has the same value), but I remember it happened while I was walking for my japa. I told her there was something more important than that semireligious recollection people have, that what was more important was the deeper nature of the Work and the choice of the adverse aspect (represented by a universal difficulty, or, at any rate, if we only consider the earth, a human difficulty), the aspect that had to be vanquished, dominated in order to lead it to the transformation. And it's in this connection that I told her that receiving the indication from the Supreme was the true thing; that He saw better than we did what had to be done and the order in which it had to be done. And I felt... (she was very concrete <em>[Mother makes a gesture as if Durga was in her])</em>, I felt she was immensely interested. Then I told her, ‚ÄúWell, you see, hasn't the time come‚Äù (I am putting it into words, but there weren't any words), ‚Äúhasn't the time come to receive from Him the direct impulsion for your action?‚Äù And she responded joyfully and spontaneously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1400">The difference is that, now, wherever she manifests, I feel the call to the supreme Truth, to manifest it, is truly there.</p>

He says it's my voice, he doesn't doubt it (he accepts even the seemingly most fanciful things), but still, for safety's sake he'd like to ask me (!) if I am indeed the one who has told him those things. And among the things I am supposed to have told him, I seem to have declared that he is a combined reincarnation of Buddha, Christ, Archangel Gabriel, Napoleon and Charlemagne!...

There are all sorts of... they aren't people: they are states of consciousness that expressed themselves or maybe even took a precise shape in the lives of all kinds of people; some of them are quite known to me: I have seen them often, they come back often and I know them very well ‚Äì I can put names to them. But these states of consciousness weren't exclusively in this or that person: they were in many people and in many ages.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1459">And it's more and more often like that. I think it's to make the [cellular] aggregate more supple, to give it suppleness.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1460">Sri Aurobindo wrote somewhere, I don't remember in what connection, that in a certain state of consciousness one had the power to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CHANGE THE PAST</span>. I found that very striking.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1461">Because it's an experience I've had several times, and with all this work I am doing now, I understand better. You see, what seems to be perpetuated or preserved isn't individuals: it's states of consciousness ‚Äì states of consciousness. Those states of consciousness manifest through many individuals and many different lives, and those states of consciousness are what progress towards a more and more luminous perfection. There are now, at present, all kinds of ‚Äúcategories‚Äù of states of consciousness that come one upon another in order to be put in contact with the Truth, the Light, the perfect Consciousness, and at the same time they have retained a sort of imprint (like a memory) of the moments when they manifested.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1462">There is a big work of transformation of the material states of consciousness going on: the states of consciousness nearest to the Inconscient, the most material states of consciousness. They come like that [to present themselves to Mother], with one or two examples of their previous manifestation (perhaps even their first emergence from the Inconscient), and then I see the transition (along with what has transformed them, changed them or even simply altered them through successive manifestations), the transition up to the point when they are now presented before the supreme Consciousness for the final transformation. This is a perpetual work, so to speak, because, interestingly, it's a work I can
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 244</p>
<p class="PE"> go on doing while seeing people. Generally my work was interrupted when I saw people, because I was busy with them and that diminished and limited the work: they represented a small aggregate of difficulties that enormously shrank the Action [of Mother]. But now it's no longer like that. And the interesting point is that it places people in this or that ‚Äúcurve of transformation‚Äù of the consciousness. For some time I have been seeing a considerable number of people I had never seen before (with all the old or familiar people there was no difficulty, but with the new ones it generally caused a shrinking of the work), and now with this ‚Äústudy‚Äù of states of consciousness, people are placed: here, there, here <em>(Mother draws different levels in space)</em>. And if they are receptive, they must go away [after seeing Mother] with a new impulse to transform themselves. Those who aren't receptive just miss it; but they are no longer a disturbance: they come in and go out. And from that I know what state they are in ‚Äì I can even do it with photos, but when I see people it's much more complete. Photos are no more than one moment of their being, while here, even what isn't being manifested is there, hidden behind, and can be seen, so I see the person more completely. It's very interesting. It transforms this whole burden of visitors into something interesting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1465">Better is difficult. As for more, we'd have to have more time! We could do a lot, I know that, but we would need time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1466"><em>But I'd like to serve you more.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1467">There are lots of things, lots of things.... Last night again, we were together for a long time. But we are together to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WORK</span> together; you understand, it's not as if you are looking after me
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 245</p>
<p class="PE"> and I am looking after you, it's not that: we meet because we work together. And there are vast movements of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1468">To tell the truth, I don't like mental activity ‚Äì I have never liked it. I worked a lot in the mind for a time: it was a phase, the phase of mental development when I did philosophy ‚Äì all philosophies, comparative philosophies ‚Äì in order to make the intellect more supple. But to tell the truth, it doesn't interest me. While states of consciousness ‚Äì movements of consciousness, states of consciousness ‚Äì that's tremendously interesting! And going on at the moment there is a very keen, that is, very painstaking study of the relationship between states of consciousness and the phenomenon of death.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1469">Ultimately, all beliefs people have about what happens after death... Human beings have long tried to know, of course, and some religions thought they had found an explanation.... I've had personal experiences. And now the problem is put in a new way, as if (I say ‚Äúas if‚Äù because I haven't come to the end and I don't know), as if what is perpetuated from life to life weren't personalities but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS</span>, which are immortal and in constant transformation at the same time, and what's transformed through one's lives is the state of consciousness.... Some have only one state of consciousness, others have many (there are even certain people who have two nearly opposite states of consciousness, which results in that ‚Äúdouble personality‚Äù and those contradictions in life). Some are very simple and have only one, and that results in almost primitive individuals; but they sometimes have a wonderful development in their state of consciousness.... That explains many contradictions. That's what I am clearly shown at the moment: states of consciousness passing through numerous aggregates. And then, there is, there too, a secret to be found for the prolongation of an aggregate, that is, what gives the character not of immortality (which is something very different), but of the indefinite duration of life ‚Äì of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FORM</span>, rather (life never stops), of the form. So then, once this study has been done in depth, another secret will have been found.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1471">Not last night but the night before, I spent a long time, almost two hours of our time here, with Sri Aurobindo. I have told you he has something that translates as an ‚Äúabode‚Äù (it's magnificent, magnificent!) in the subtle physical. It's always immense, so clear, well-defined, yet fully open. And I get a sense of... </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 246</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1472"><em>(Mother takes a deep breath)</em> phew! open, luminous ‚Äì always, in every case. He is there... maybe not quite as he was here (but it makes no difference to me because the change has been very progressive: I have followed Sri Aurobindo almost from day to day, step by step), and he is perhaps rather taller, with perhaps a form that has greater perfection, I don't know, but to me, his expression... <em>(Mother smiles with her eyes closed)</em>... his expression is inexpressible. I spent a very, very long time with him. In those huge rooms (they are limitless, you know, you feel you could go indefinitely from one room to another, from one place to another), he was directing... It was in a part of the place with a certain number of rooms (four, five or six, I don't know), large rooms where he was directing a pottery, just imagine! But it wasn't like here. There were objects made of clay. There wasn't any process of firing, painting or any like that (it wasn't like here), but there were shapes which looked like pottery shapes, and they had a power <em>(Mother gestures downward)</em> to manifest. And then, there was everything: animals, plants, people, things, everything, with all possible colors. I went from one to another, looking, explaining. I had spent a long time with him, and I knew exactly why and how it was done, and afterwards I went and studied the work and observed. Then the rooms were arranged, the things were put in their place: that was as if to show the result. And things... charming in their simplicity, yet they contained an extraordinary power of manifestation! But they had a deep meaning. I took an object made of a very dark reddish brown earth, and it was badly put together, that is, the shape wasn't right and I showed it to the ‚Äúpottery foreman‚Äù (there was a pottery foreman in each room, looking after the work). I showed it to him, and told him (it was fairly big at the bottom, with a small piece at the top <em>[Mother draws a sort of vase with a neck]</em>, anyway it wasn't well done), I explained it to him, saying, ‚ÄúYou understand, it's not properly balanced.‚Äù And while I was holding it in my fingers ‚Äì it broke. Then he said to me, ‚ÄúOh, I am going to mend it.‚Äù I answered, ‚ÄúIf you like, but it's not as it should be....‚Äù Of course, we say it with our words, but there, it had a very precise <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MEANING</span>. Then, there were kinds of big openings between one room and another (they weren't ‚Äúrooms,‚Äù they were huge halls), and one went on to the place where they made ‚Äúfish‚Äù! But the fish weren't fish (!), they had another meaning. And there were fish this big, made of clay, colored and gleaming, magnificent: one was blue-green, another yellowish white, but pretty, so pretty! And they were kept on the floor as if it were water: the fish were kept on the floor, right
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 247</p>
<p class="PE"> in the way. So I thought, ‚ÄúThat's not very convenient!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> And said like this, it all looks like childishness, but there it had a very deep meaning, very deep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1473">It was very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1474">I spent at least two hours like that. It must have been between one and three in the night. And the sense of something so very peaceful, so comfortable and full of light and consciousness ‚Äì especially consciousness ‚Äì oh, it was wonderful. The consciousness here seems very, very restricted. Very restricted. And because it expresses itself through thought it's weighed down: that weighs it down, restricts it... fossilizes it. While there, the consciousness moves about freely in full light, oh, such a clear, clear atmosphere, so limpid... shadowless... yet everything has a shape. There are even streets (there are other places), but everything is like that, in full light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1475">The feeling remained for hours afterwards.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1476">And it seems to be developing and completed fantastically fast: from one visit to the next (with at times an interval of eight days, perhaps), there is an extraordinary change, tremendous. Sri Aurobindo himself changes. I find him... Previously (two years ago, for instance) I found him very like what he was physically; of course, I saw him almost right in the beginning in his supramental reality, but that's very different: I am speaking of the Sri Aurobindo who is in constant, constant contact with us ‚Äì it's like an emanation of the other [the supramental Sri Aurobindo] and like the continuation of the Sri Aurobindo who lived with us. That's how it is. Well, for a time, he looked like himself much more than he does now; now it's as though he looked more like the other. But still, remaining very close to us, very close.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1477">And the work is proceeding fast, fast....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1478">There are some people over there who lived on earth, but not many. That's where I met several times (very often during the first year after her death) the woman who used to cook for Sri Aurobindo. What was her name?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1479"><em>Mridu.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1480">Mridu! She has also changed a lot, quite a lot, but... <em>(Mother smiles, amused)</em> in a way she is still the same!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1481">But I felt (it was yesterday, I think) that things are much simpler
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 248</p>
<p class="PE"> ‚Äì much simpler ‚Äì and much less dramatic than human thought imagines. It's very strange, I have a growing feeling of something... without mystery, and that it's our way of thinking and feeling that adds the whole mystery and the whole drama ‚Äì while in fact there isn't any.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1482">Oh, how men dramatize everything!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1483">It's like their relationship with the Divine.... Yesterday, while I was working here in the morning (distributing the eggs!), they made me listen to music by 
Sahana,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="68" href="#">1</a> a hymn by their group which is in the line of ‚Äúreligious music.‚Äù There are sounds, certain sounds that may be called ‚Äúreligious sounds‚Äù; they are certain ‚Äúassociations of sounds,‚Äù which are universal, that is, they don't belong to a particular time or a particular country. In all times and all countries, those who have had this religious emotion have spontaneously given out this sound. While the music was playing, that perception came to me very clearly (it's an association of two or three sounds), it came with the very state of consciousness that produces these sounds, and which is always the same: the sounds reproduce the state of consciousness. The whole [instrumental] accompaniment is different, and naturally that always, always spoils it. But these two ‚Äì two or three ‚Äì sounds are wonderfully expressive, in a precise, exact way, of the religious feeling, the Contact <em>(gesture to the Heights)</em>, the adoration: the contact of adoration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1484">It was very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1485">And in her piece, this sound recurs two or three times. All the rest is padding. But that... And I've heard it in churches, I've heard it in temples, I've heard it in mystic gatherings, I've heard it... Always mixed with all kinds of other things, but that's... And these sounds are absolutely evocative of the effect ‚Äì in fact it's the other way around: it's the state of consciousness that produces these sounds, but when you hear the sounds it puts you in contact with the state of consciousness. So then, I understood why people like to listen to this music: it's because it suddenly gives them... ah! they feel something unknown to them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1486">How interesting it was!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1487">How different everything becomes! You live in the state of consciousness, and then everything becomes different. You see things... yes, I think that's what Sri Aurobindo calls seeing things from within outward. One causes the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1488">Very interesting.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 249</p>
<p class="PE"> In Sunil's music there are two or three of those associations of sounds that are evocative associations, and in his music it's the splendor of the future creation, oh, it comes like a dazzling sun.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1489">But even in very old music, or disjointed music, there is that association now and then: two sounds, a relationship between two sounds (two, sometimes three). And I don't think people are aware of it, but that's what puts them in contact with the state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1490">In reality, it's one way of looking at the problem, but it makes things simpler in a truly interesting way.... In other words, great transformations are merely the result of a change of state of consciousness.</p>

You understand, they are all in a terrible confusion: for them, the soul is just anything. Do they want to prove the existence of the soul, which is eternal, immortal, or the existence of an afterlife? The two things are different. Afterlife has been scientifically proved by cases: there have been quite a few cases of people who in their present life carried on with their previous life. There was the story of that father who died, and the child of a neighboring family gave extraordinary details, things that the dead father alone knew. He alone knew them, and as soon as the child was able to move independently, that is, at the age of five or six, he started trying to lead his former life again; he would say, ‚ÄúMy children are waiting for me in that house, I must go and look after them‚Äù! He was a child, yet he said, ‚ÄúMy children are waiting for me over there.‚Äù And that house was where he had died. There were quite precise details that the dead father alone knew: he would say, ‚ÄúBut I put that here, why did it go?‚Äù All kinds of things like that. This is a fairly recent case. There have been at least four or five recorded cases, therefore there is an afterlife. But what is it that lives after? Of course, in the case of that child, it's not the soul, it has
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 254</p>
<p class="PE"> nothing to do with the soul: it's beings of the 
Vital<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69" href="#">1</a> (the mentalized vital) that remained intact and, because of some special circumstance, reincarnated immediately. So their previous life was still ‚Äúquite fresh.‚Äù The case of that child seems to me scientifically indisputable because they can't say, ‚ÄúHe is mad,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIt's a hallucination‚Äù ‚Äì he is a child and he speaks of ‚Äúhis children.‚Äù There have been other cases as convincing as this one (I don't remember them). But is this what they want to know? Or do they want to know whether there is a soul and whether it is immortal and... In reality, they don't know anything. It's a question put by ignorant people. They should be told in the first place, ‚ÄúExcuse me! Before asking questions, you should study the problem.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1506">There was the story of Ford, who had sent word to Sri Aurobindo and me that he was coming here to ask us the question that tormented him: ‚ÄúWhat happens after death?‚Äù And he said he was ready to give his fortune to whoever could answer him. Someone had told him, ‚ÄúYes, Sri Aurobindo can answer you.‚Äù So Ford had sent word that he was preparing to come and ask us his question. And then he died!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1507">No, those are questions asked by ignorant people. They should first learn the matter and know what they're talking about.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1508">There is the soul. There is the soul, which is quite simply an emanation of... we can call it the supreme Consciousness, supreme Reality, supreme Truth, anything, whatever they like, it's all the same to me ‚Äì any words they like. But anyway, the soul is an emanation of That, a direct emanation. In the body, That becomes clothed in the psychic being. The psychic being is a being which is progressively formed throughout all the existences. So are you talking about the soul, are you talking about the psychic being (which is first an embryo and eventually becomes a conscious, perfectly independent being), or are you simply talking of the life of an individual consciousness after death? Because that's yet another thing. There are proofs of that; but in that case, it's a quite vital consciousness of an inferior order, and it may happen to immediately come back into another body through some combination of circumstances (it was into the same family that the father had come back), and to come back with the memory. Otherwise, according to the experiences of those who have studied the question, it's only the psychic being in the process of being formed that retains the memory of its former existences. But it retains the
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 255</p>
<p class="PE"> memory of the material, purely physical existence <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY FOR THOSE MOMENTS WHEN IT PARTICIPATED</span>. So, instead of all those stories that are told (and are made up), you only have memories like that <em>(Mother draws a series of ‚Äúpoints‚Äù in space with her fingertips)</em>, which may be more or less detailed, more or less complete, but which are only fragmentary memories of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MOMENT</span> when the psychic physically manifested. Lots of people do have this sort of memory, but they don't know what it is. Most of the time they regard it as ‚Äúdreams‚Äù or ‚Äúimaginings.‚Äù Those who know (that is to say, who are conscious of what goes on in their physical consciousness) can see that it's memories.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1509">The number of memories of this kind I've had is almost incalculable. But it doesn't have the same character as the memories of the higher consciousness (then it's not a ‚Äúmemory‚Äù: it's a sort of vision the higher 
beings<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="70" href="#">2</a> have of life; but that's something else). The memories I speak of are memories of the psychic being, they have a different character: a rather personal character, I mean there is the sense of a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PERSON</span> remembering something. While the others, the visions from above, are memories of an ‚Äúacting consciousness.‚Äù But the memories of the psychic being aren't mentalized, that is, if for instance at the time of the recollection you weren't paying attention to the way you were dressed or the surroundings, you don't remember them. You only remember what took place and especially what took place from the point of view of the consciousness and the feelings and the inner movements.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1510">It's generally fragments ‚Äì fragments of life ‚Äì that were individualized, and when in the present life you follow a normal development with the [various beings] gathering around the central consciousness, all those elements come back to gather together. They come back, each with its own memories. For instance, I had a memory like that (I tell you, I've had hundreds of them) when I was very young (I must have been twenty or so). It wasn't at night, but I was lying down, resting: suddenly I felt myself riding a horse, with tremendous warlike power and the sense... a will for victory and the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POWER</span> of victory. And I felt as if I was riding a horse: I saw a white horse, I saw my legs, with riding breeches, you understand, and a red velvet costume. And there I was, at a gallop. I couldn't tell what the head was like or anything, naturally! And also, the crowd, the armies, and the rising sun. It was so strong, the sense
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 256</p>
<p class="PE"> that... it was the sense of the will for victory and the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POWER</span> of victory. It came just like that. Then, sometime later, I read somewhere the story of Murat (I forget... I think his victory was 
Magenta<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="71" href="#">3</a>... I no longer remember all that), and I immediately understood that my vision was at the moment of launching the battle: he had an inner call to a Power, so there was an identification [with Mother's power], and that's what I remembered and what came back. If I said (as the Theosophists tell you), ‚ÄúI was Murat,‚Äù it would be stupid. But it was a consciousness coming back. It was so strong! The impression lasted long enough, with the sense of the battle but above all the sense of that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POWER</span> making you invincible. It was interesting, because at the time (it was just in the beginning, I was beginning to take interest in these things and I had just come across the ‚ÄúCosmic‚Äù teaching), I was convinced that a woman's psychic being was always reincarnated in a woman and a man's psychic being was always reincarnated in a man (many schools teach that; Th√©on too believed so, he insisted on it). So it came as a surprise, because it wasn't in conformity with what I thought (!). Afterwards (long afterwards), I realized that naturally all those dogmas were nonsense, but...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1511">It fits with what I told you last time: the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS</span> are what reincarnate, evolving, developing, growing more perfect. That's rather how it was, that's how that memory came. It's like that with many memories. And I know that to say ‚Äústates of consciousness are what reincarnate,‚Äù to adopt that as the ‚Äúsole‚Äù explanation would be incorrect ‚Äì it's absolutely incorrect ‚Äì but it's one way of looking at the question beyond the sense of the little personality. It broadens the consciousness: one has in oneself things far more universal and far less limited than personal experiences.

As for me, I always answer with the story of Buddha: as he was about to enter Nirvana, he suddenly realized that the earth had to be changed... and stayed on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1553">I remember, once, it was with Madame David-Neel. It's very interesting. She came to give a lecture (I wasn't acquainted with her, that's where I met her for the first time), I think it was at the Theosophical Society (I forget). I went to the lecture, and while she was speaking, I saw Buddha ‚Äì I saw him clearly: not above her head, a little to the side. He was present. So after the lecture, I was introduced to her (I didn't know the kind of woman she was!), and I said to her, ‚ÄúOh, Madam, during your speech I saw Buddha present.‚Äù She answered me <em>(in a furious tone)</em>, ‚ÄúImpossible! Buddha is in Nirvana!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> Oho!... ‚ÄúBetter keep quiet!‚Äù I thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1554">But he really was there, whatever she thought!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1555">That's what it is: going away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1556"><em>I didn't understand why Pavitra, who is here, wrote like that.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1557">No, I understand his thought quite well: he see things too closely, mon petit! He sees that all the effort of the earth must be towards the Divine, towards union with the Divine; he sees... (how should I put it?) what precedes, and sees it too closely, not from a sufficient distance. So then, for him, the return is the return towards the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1558">But if he were told, ‚ÄúAbolition, Nirvana,‚Äù he would say, ‚ÄúNo, no! not at all.‚Äù Only, he doesn't see that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1559">In reality, it's a threefold movement: the creation, which was the ‚Äúflight from the Divine‚Äù (according, of course, to the ordinary conception which says that the creation ‚Äúfell,‚Äù it ‚Äúwandered away‚Äù from the Divine and men ‚Äúwandered away‚Äù from the Divine); that was the first movement. But that's because he sees it too closely; he doesn't see that the Divine plunged to the very bottom of the Inconscient. (And that's the question: Why did He plunge to the very bottom of the Inconscient?... That's to be ‚Äúinvestigated‚Äù <em>[Mother laughs]</em>, one doesn't yet know how to explain it: everyone explains it differently.) He plunged to the
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 262</p>
<p class="PE"> very bottom (as for me, I think I know why, but that will be for later). He plunged to the very bottom of the Inconscient: beneath the stone <em>(Mother makes a gesture of immutability, at the very bottom)</em>, beneath the mineral; the mineral is already a first awakening of the consciousness.... But you have to see it as a whole to understand that it's an ascent. If you see human life as it is, the impression is that men become lost in the ‚Äúfall,‚Äù but that's the result of the Mind; the Mind needed to go through the whole experience, to go down to the very bottom in order to understand everything and bring everything back towards the ascent. For plants, it's really an ascent. Thus, according to this vision, there are three movements. But if you see the whole simultaneously, there are only two movements: the first movement is the descent of the Lord into the Inconscient (we can't say anything about that for the moment; once we have emerged from it, we'll be able to say); the second (the first we can conceive of) is, very, very slowly, through all possible experiences, even the most complete mental denials of the Divine, the ascent towards the Divine. And then, once we have climbed up... <em>(Mother makes a gesture of descent)</em>, ‚ÄúCome, come here: change this prison into the mansion of the Divine.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1560">That will be very good, a very good ‚Äúmessage‚Äù for 4.5.67.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1561">Four is manifestation. Five is power. Six is creation, and seven is realization. Four figures in a wonderful sequence.

<p class="PE"> that when I was tranquil, something (which wasn't human at all) was there, quietly acting through me (I wasn't even occupied with it) and doing it. That was my very clear impression. I even did some experiments at that time. For instance, once, in a bus, there was a man who was tense and weeping; you could see he was utterly wretched. Then without stirring, unnoticed, I saw that ‚ÄúForce‚Äù going out towards that man, and little by little, his face relaxed, everything calmed down, he grew quiet. This also happened several times. And that's how I knew... Because at the time I wasn't very well informed yet; I always felt the Power up above, but didn't know what it was ‚Äì there was a ‚ÄúForce‚Äù that would come like that and act quietly. It's the same thing now, but fully conscious. It's the same thing: something that takes hold of the body. The body participates (meaning that it doesn't at all feel it's ‚Äúacting,‚Äù it almost doesn't feel itself), it's only aware of a... oh, so warm, so sweet a vibration, and at the same time so ter-ri-bly powerful! It comes like that, and the body doesn't need to want or try or anything: it doesn't think, doesn't strive, doesn't stir <em>(Mother makes a gesture of bathing wholly in the Lord)</em>: it's spontaneous and natural.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1605">Sometimes, when it's tired or something isn't quite all right or... (that always comes from a contact with outside; afterwards I see, I know what the cause was, but while it's happening there is simply a discomfort or a disorganization), then, oh, it's exactly like a child's trusting abandon in... something... which is everywhere, around it, inside it, there, like this <em>(enveloping gesture)</em>. And the body's aspiration is just, ‚ÄúMay That alone exist.‚Äù All the rest... oof! it's nothing at all, a nuisance. ‚ÄúMay That alone exist.... If That alone existed, what a marvelous world this would be!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1606">That's how it feels. All the rest is either a bother or deeply ridiculous. Oh, often it's so ridiculous! At any rate, so flimsy, so dry, like a bad performance. And what becomes quite comical, truly amusing and comical is... <em>(Mother puffs up her cheeks)</em> when the ego swells up! Oh, then...! The egos that assert themselves, that come and tell you, ‚ÄúI want this, I don't want that, I have decided that...‚Äù Oh, mon petit, that's the <em>big fun!</em> And they don't in the least see that they are puppets.</p>

Maheshwari<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="76" href="#">1</a> has manifested in a golden light, that Sri Aurobindo has come (where from, I don't know!) and said that the world wasn't ready and that was why there are catastrophes and cyclones ‚Äì haven't you heard the story?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1620">The story is unimportant, except that some people were distraught: they were expecting the end of the world! Sri Aurobindo saying ‚Äúthe world isn't ready‚Äù means it's coming to an end!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1621">Anyway, yesterday (I think it's in answer to this story of Maheshwari and Sri Aurobindo saying the world isn't ready), I wrote something in French, but it was under the pressure of Sri Aurobindo's consciousness. He said <em>(Mother takes a note and reads)</em>:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1622">‚ÄúAccording to the law of men, the guilty must be punished. But there is a more imperative law than the human law: it is the law of the Divine, the law of compassion and mercy. It is thanks to this law that the world can last and progress...‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1625">The guilty must be punished!... It's always the same idea; men always have that idea: the guilty must be punished ‚Äì but where does that lead to??</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1626">I also wrote another thing. I told you that on the day of Kali puja she came and was displeased. So I wrote <em>(Mother takes another note and reads)</em>:</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1628">This notation, you know, was purely and simply a question of vibration; it was the vibration of mental arrogance (which is perceptible, clear, absolutely clear). It came and took up the whole space... <em>(Mother makes a gesture of puffing up)</em>, it took up a lot of space!... It took up the whole space, and then, this very tranquil, very calm Action, so... noiseless, without ado, unassuming; it goes like this <em>(gesture of imperturbable descent)</em>, with perfect simplicity ‚Äì and it was absolutely blocked, it couldn't get through! So I wrote this note.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1630">It was the result of Kali. And it was a very strong experience (a material one, here; not far away: here). Something has been clarified since it was said. There was a sort of absolute need to say

<p class="PE"> it. And something has been 
clarified.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="77" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1631">I should also say that ever since financial affairs started being none too bright, all manner of things have been reaching my ears.... There are big difficulties. I am obliged to tell people that I can't pay and they shouldn't spend needlessly, and on the other hand, I am looking, trying to find where the obstacle is.... Because the power to attract money remains as it has always been (and it's considerable), so there should be no difficulties. So I wrote this note because I see clearly in people's thought, they all keep saying, ‚ÄúOh, we should do this, oh, we shouldn't do that, oh, if Mother did this, oh, if Mother didn't do that....‚Äù Some are bold enough to say it, others aren't but think that way ‚Äì there are very few who don't think that way. And still fewer say to themselves, ‚ÄúI'd better not be concerned with it because I don't understand the first thing about it.‚Äù So I was as if compelled to take the pen and write that down: ‚ÄúThey know what should be done, they know <em>...‚Äù (Mother makes a gesture of hammering the disciples' heads)</em>.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1632">Did I tell you last time that in Bihar, the rain started that very evening?... I found out how it occurred. It's P. who flew over Bihar, and he saw a desert, devastation: dry, dry, dry, nothing growing, cracked earth. Then he remembered certain experiences

And he said, ‚ÄúWhy don't you ask Mother?‚Äù The other answered quite spontaneously, ‚ÄúIt would be better if you asked for us!‚Äù Then he sent his telegram. The same evening it started raining. He wrote, saying, ‚ÄúThis first rain has been like divine nectar to me.‚Äù He said that people there were entirely trusting and as well-disposed as could be. And he saw a relation between those droughts, those natural catastrophes, and the forces that stop money from coming; he saw they were affected by that experience of unexpected rain. For example, at the same time (a day or two later), he met some people who aren't rich (the husband has a good position, but they aren't rich: they have a family, children). For some reason or other the husband had been given a compensation of 10,000 rupees by the government, and quite

I don't need it.‚Äù In other words, the true attitude. So it immediately made P. think that something is on the move.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1633">And I saw this note of yesterday as indicative of the key (I mean ‚Äúinwardly,‚Äù in the universal attitudes). It was all clearly seen: men always believe that the guilty must be punished, that it's the way out of the difficulty, but the true way is compassion and mercy. It's not that you are ignorant of the true movement and the false one, but you have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SPONTANEOUS</span> mercy, effortlessly ‚Äì and at all times.

Because attacks multiply tremendously, and today, for instance, I found only one solution, which was to stay lying down: while it was going on, not to eat anything, not to say anything, not to move. Then it's all right. As soon as I stop moving, eating, acting, it's all right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1678">It's been a long time since these attacks last came. I told you several times that I was able to resist the attack, but this time, this morning, it was formidable. Formidable. It was exactly like this Gentleman [Death] trying to uproot everything. So I resisted and resisted, then suddenly... it could no longer walk, I had to lie down and stay still. And also not eat ‚Äì I didn't feel like eating. I can eat only when everything is fine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1679">As soon as there is stillness and contemplation, it's fine.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1680">No, there is an insistence (the same insistence as this Gentleman's, at any rate) on the impossibility of the thing, and it gives such obvious proof.... Naturally, the inside doesn't budge, it smiles ‚Äì it doesn't budge ‚Äì but the body... that gives it terrible tension. Because it's very conscious of its infirmity (it can't boast of being transformed), very conscious that it's millions of miles away from transformation. So... so it doesn't take much to convince it. What's more difficult is to give it the certitude that things will be different. It doesn't even understand very well how they can be different. Then there come all other beliefs, all other so-called revelations, the heavens and so on. The whole of Christianity and Islam have very easily solved the problem: ‚ÄúOh, no, things here will never be fine, but over there they can be perfect.‚Äù That goes without saying. Then there is the whole of Nirvanism and Buddhism: ‚ÄúThe world is an error that must disappear.‚Äù So it all comes in waves, and the body feels very... you understand, it would like to have a certitude of its possibility. That doesn't often happen to it. But the attack was too strong; it was from everything and everywhere at the same time, so strong: ‚ÄúThis Matter <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> be transformed.‚Äù So it fought and fought and fought, and suddenly it was obliged to lie down. But as soon as it lies down and abandons
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 278</p>
<p class="PE"> itself completely, there is Peace, and such a strong Peace ‚Äì so strong, so powerful. Then it's fine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1681">It came with hosts of suggestions (they aren't suggestions: they are formations), adverse formations of disorganization; like, for instance the one C. [one of Mother's attendants, who has just fallen ill] received. I was warned two days beforehand and tried my best: I couldn't ‚Äì I couldn't, he gave way. So now it's dragging on and on (the doctor himself says there's no reason for it to last so long), it's dragging on because he gave way. So all that must be slowly won back. And it comes to everyone, to every circumstance ‚Äì not to me, never to me because it has no effect on me: if the suggestion comes, I say, ‚ÄúSo what! I don't care.‚Äù So it doesn't try, it's useless. But it comes to everyone, to disorganize everything and everyone, one after another. This morning, it was everybody at the same time, a complete disorganization of everything. I resisted and resisted and resisted, then suddenly something... <em>(Mother makes a gesture)</em>. So the body said, ‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1682">If I stay still, it's over. I skipped a meal. The doctor is unhappy, but <em>(laughing)</em> it makes <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ME</span> happy! Meals are work (a lot of work).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1683">It's the first time this year it has happened to me. Previously, it used to happen fairly often, but it's the first time this year. It shows that, all the same, things are improving.... Oh, but it was terrible, people can't imagine what it is! It takes hold of everyone and everybody, every circumstance and everything, and it gives shape to disintegration ‚Äì quite like this Gentleman (I think he's the one!), quite like him. But it doesn't have the poetic form [of <em>Savitri</em>], of course, it's not a poet: it has all the meanness of life. And it insists on that a great deal. These last few days it insisted on it a great deal. I said to myself, ‚ÄúSee, all that is written and said is always in a realm of beauty and harmony and greatness, and, anyway, the problem is put with dignity; but as soon as it becomes quite practical and material, it's so petty, so mean, so narrow, so ugly!...‚Äù That's the proof. When you get out of it, it's all right, you can face all problems, but when you come down here, it's so ugly, so petty, so miserable.... We are such slaves to our needs, oh!... For one hour, two hours, you hold on, and after... And it's true, physical life is ugly ‚Äì not everywhere, but anyway... I always think of plants and flowers: that's really lovely, it's free from that; but human life is so sordid, with such crude and imperious needs ‚Äì it's so sordid.... It's only when you begin to live in a slightly superior vision that you become free from that; in all the Scriptures, very few people accept the sordidness of life. And of
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 279</p>
<p class="PE"> course, that's what this Gentleman insists on. I said, ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù This body's answer is very simple: ‚ÄúWe certainly aren't anxious that life should continue as it is.‚Äù It doesn't find it very pretty. But we conceive of a life ‚Äì a life as objective as our material life ‚Äì which wouldn't have all these sordid needs, which would be more harmonious and spontaneous. That's what we want. But he says it's impossible ‚Äì we have been ‚Äútold‚Äù it's not only possible but certain. So there's the battle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1684">Then comes the great argument: ‚ÄúYes, yes, one day it will be, but when?... For the time being you are still swamped in all this and you plainly see it can't change. It will go on and on. In millennia, yes, it will be.‚Äù That's the ultimate argument. He no longer denies the possibility, he says, ‚ÄúAll right, because you have caught hold of something, you're hoping to realize it now, but that's childishness.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1685">So the body itself says, ‚ÄúBut of course, I certainly accept that, I perfectly understand! That's not what I want; I don't want this thing or that: I simply want what the Lord wants, nothing else ‚Äì what He has decided will be. When He says it's over, it will be over; if He says it is to go on, it will go on.‚Äù But then, as this Gentleman can't have his way like this, it comes from every side: this or that individual, this or that thing, that circumstance, all of it, all of it is going to be disorganized. Then I start working [to thwart the attack].</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1686">Today it was really very clever ‚Äì very clever. He is very clever.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1687">He is a big joker.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1688">There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1689">So I haven't done my work, haven't done a thing. But I decided I would see you ‚Äì not to work but to see you.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1690">To protect others, it's very effective, because I start working and struggling. The only argument for this body is: ‚ÄúYou plainly see it goes on deteriorating, so what are you hoping for?... It will go on deteriorating until it stops.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1691">But if one looks at it without prejudice, quite objectively, it's only an appearance of deterioration: it's not true. On the contrary, on certain points it's much more solid than it used to be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1692">The most important point is what we could call the ‚Äúunreality of deterioration,‚Äù in other words, everything that isn't harmonious or is disorganized increasingly gives the sense of an illusion ‚Äì it's increasingly an illusion ‚Äì and the sense that a certain inner
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 280</p>
<p class="PE"> movement of consciousness would be enough for that not to be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1693">There, the problem comes up again. Because there are various detailed experiences (in tiny details), detailed experiences of different attitudes of consciousness to find out which of them is effective. It's a whole field of study. It's microscopic, of course, but extremely interesting. And then, the answer is always the same; it's so lovely: ‚ÄúWhen you forget that you are, when there only remains the Lord, all difficulties instantly disappear.‚Äù Instantly: the previous second, the difficulty was there; the next second, gone. But it's not something that can be done artificially; it's not some mental or personal will to take this attitude: it must be spontaneous. And when it's spontaneous, then all difficulties <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INSTANTLY</span> disappear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1694">Stop existing ‚Äì the Lord alone exists.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1695">And it's the only remedy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1696">But how to do this?... You understand, <em>surrender</em>, self-giving, acceptance, all that is really being done more and more, better and better, but it's not enough ‚Äì it's not enough. That's the point. Even the attempt of the consciousness to center on the Lord's existence and to try and forget, even that isn't enough. It has some effect, but a mixed one: that's not ‚Äúit.‚Äù But when you succeed in... ceasing to exist ‚Äì the Lord alone ‚Äì instantly there's a glory, that's what is marvelous!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1697">But it's difficult. There is a very old habit that makes it be otherwise.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1698">Yet it's the only remedy, there is no other. It's not even a <em>surrender</em> (the word ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù isn't the true one because there is still ‚Äúsomething surrendering,‚Äù and that's not it), it's not even an annihilation because nothing is annihilated.... I can't explain: only the Lord exists, nothing else. And then, what a marvel! Instantly a marvel.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1699">And in microscopic details, you know; it's not a question of ‚Äúimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù things, nothing of the sort: it applies to a cellular action. And it's the only remedy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1700">When will Matter be ready for ‚Äúthat‚Äù? That's the question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1701">Inwardly it's easy, but outwardly... There is all of a sudden, especially in the brain's matter, here <em>(gesture to the temples)</em>, that movement of descent, of the Lord taking possession, and then outwardly you feel as if you're fainting. That's why you can't remain standing and have to lie down; but when you lie down, it's almost instantaneous, everything disappears: the sense of time, of difficulty, absolutely everything ‚Äì there only remains a luminous

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1709">Yes, a great many. I have been told this several times, but naturally... There are a great many of those so-called <em>swamis</em> and <em>sadhus</em> who are quite simply tricksters, but they have a rudimentary occult knowledge in a field where, unfortunately, it takes very little knowledge to be able to do a lot of <em>mischief</em>. There are lots of them ‚Äì not one or two, but lots. And I know people who went and saw them, who begged them and tried to make them intervene [against Mother]. They have turned either against people around me or against myself. Not many against myself, but one or two of them think they are the ‚Äúlords of the world,‚Äù and therefore completely <em>immune</em>, so they have tried, but... It can cause a little friction, that's all, it's nothing. But when it's directed towards people around me, it's more difficult to counter because there is always... there's always a slight response. They aren't pure enough. Then it gives me a lot of trouble. That's what happened last time, it was towards all those around me: it gave me a lot of work.</p>

Towards something they don't understand. And then, they use a rather rudimentary occult knowledge. I did what had to be done, but in the beginning I didn't think it was exactly magic: there were lots of reasons. Then, yesterday, C. himself had a dream in which someone was chasing after him (someone or something, he didn't know exactly what), and he ran and ran to escape. He ran till he woke up, and he woke up completely out of breath, as exhausted as if he had really run. Then I said to myself that what I had thought was correct.</p>

Which means it doesn't depend on a defect of the sight or the material organ: it's something else ‚Äì something else that one wants me to learn. Because it constantly comes back as if to show me something. But there's so much work and so many people that I don't always have the time to stop and concentrate to see what it is.

Then if I concentrate, I see that patch grow bright and luminous, like a dark blue star, and that star moves in front of me (it doesn't depend on the eye), it moves about, and if I fix my eyes on someone, for instance, I see that dark blue star go and rest here or there <em>(gesture at different levels of the person)</em>, at the exact spot where some work has to be done. So it means it doesn't depend on the eye, it's independent of the eye. And also if I look at a photo, with a certain position between the right eye and the left, I suddenly see the photo come alive, in three dimensions, with the person's head sticking out.

November 24,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="84" href="#">1</a> and Sri Aurobindo replied. It was so interesting! I saw something all of a sudden. While he was speaking it was absolutely marvelous. I saw the Compassion and the Grace, the ‚Äúlaw‚Äù and the Compassion, and how the Compassion acts on everyone ‚Äì on everyone and everything, without distinction and without condition ‚Äì and how the Compassion consists in bringing them to a state in which they can receive the Grace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1732">I found that wonderful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1733">That was the experience: I saw and felt this Compassion working through the meshes of the net, and how the Grace is all-powerful, meaning that the ‚ÄúLaw‚Äù isn't an obstacle any longer. I saw this Compassion touching everyone and giving everyone their chance; I understood what he really meant when he said that it ‚Äúgives everyone their chance‚Äù ‚Äì equally, without the slightest distinction of importance or condition or anything, or of state: exactly the same chance to all. So then, the result of this Compassion was to awaken them to the existence of the Grace, to make them feel that there is in the universe something like the Grace. And with those who aspire and have trust, the Grace acts immediately ‚Äì it always acts, but with those who have trust it becomes fully effective.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1734">All this was so clear, so precise! It really was like a new experience, a revelation. And how Sri Aurobindo was the expression of this Compassion....

It's the same thing as what in the past used to be called the ‚Äúgift of tongues.‚Äù There were prophets who spoke, and everyone heard in his native tongue ‚Äì he spoke in any particular language, but each of those present heard in his native tongue. I had that experience a very long time ago (I didn't do it purposely, I knew nothing about it): I spoke at a ‚ÄúBahai‚Äù gathering, and people from different countries came and congratulated me because I knew their language (which I didn't know at all!): they had heard in their language.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1756">You understand, what comes is something that arouses ‚Äì it arouses words or gets clothed in words. Then it depends: it may arouse different words. And it's in a universal storehouse, not necessarily an individual one; it's not necessarily individual since it can be clothed in words. Languages are such narrow things, while that is universal.... What could I call it?... It's not the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù but the spirit of the thing (though it's more concrete than that): it's the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POWER</span> of the thing. And because of the quality of the power, the best quality of words is attracted. It's inspiration that
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 290</p>
<p class="PE"> arouses the words; the inspired person isn't the one who finds or adapts them, not at all: it's inspiration that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AROUSES</span> the words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1757">But I understand what you mean. You want to know if it's something ready-made, ready-prepared, which you pull down as it is.... <em>(Mother remains silent)</em>. That exists in a realm far higher than words. For example, I have often received something like that <em>(gesture from above)</em>, direct, then I translate it; I don't try to find it (the more silent I am, the more powerful and concrete it grows ‚Äì powerfully concrete), but I often see, as coming from Sri Aurobindo, something that adds a correction, a precision (rarely an addition, it's not that: it's only in the form, especially in the line of precision); the first expression is a little hazy, then it becomes more precise. And I don't try to find it, I don't strive, there isn't any mental activity: it's always like this <em>(even, still gesture to the forehead)</em>, and it's always in this [stillness] that it comes: suddenly it comes ‚Äì plop! plop! I say, ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù and note it down.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1758">This is my experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1759">I don't know, there may exist somewhere in the mental region something ready-made, but I think it would then be like some of those things Sri Aurobindo 
wrote,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">2</a> which came ready-made, as they were; there were even things that didn't conform to his own view: it came imperatively. But now I don't have that experience at all. Or else, it would be like what happened the other day: for two or three minutes, as I told you, there was ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù playing. It must have been the same phenomenon. But then, the feeling is quite different: you no longer exist, you are hardly conscious of what goes on. And that would be ‚Äúincorrigible,‚Äù I may say, in the sense that it would come ready-made and you couldn't change anything in it, or else it would no longer be the same thing, it would be something you did actively. As soon as the mind becomes active, it's finished. Finished. It may come from your supraconscient, but it becomes a quite personal thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1760">But that inspiration comes from the highest region, the region beyond all individualizations. That's why it's something we find difficult to formulate and explain. It's complete, perfect in itself, but it doesn't have anything of the character of our mental formulation, not at all; it doesn't even have the character of a formulated idea. And it's absolutely imperative, absolutely. But then, as soon as it touches the mental zone, it seems to attract words. My impression is that the more silent I am, the more precise it is; in other
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 291</p>
<p class="PE"> words, the more inactive the mind is, the more precise the expression. So that's what it is, it's that force coming down and attracting words. It's not even ideas (it doesn't come through the region of ideas): it's an experience, it's something living which comes and which, to take expression, catches hold of words. What came on Sunday was like that: I was asked that question on the Grace, then I was seized by a concentrated, extremely strong silence for maybe a minute (not even that long), and it came. Then I spoke. I heard myself speaking. But then it clearly came through Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1761">If it were already written, fully ready somewhere, you couldn't change anything in it; when it was there you would feel it's perfect in itself and you can't change anything in it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1762"><em>That would be fine!... When I write, what I constantly despair of is being true to something that should be expressed <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OUTSIDE ME</span></em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1763">But that's what I've told you, it's that direct inspiration. Because if you knew how imperative what comes from above is! All thoughts appear neutral, powerless...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1764"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1765">... partial, flimsy. That's the feeling they give.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1766">When the words come quite spontaneously, it's good, but... It's an odd phenomenon: sometimes the pure experience alone is there ‚Äì what is it? You can't formulate it; in order to formulate it, you are immediately forced to use words, and words diminish. But I remember, at the time of the experience, I spoke, hardly hearing what I said, but I had the experience. (The experience was wonderfully clear, powerful, immense ‚Äì universal, you know.) Then I listened to myself speaking, and I saw that first shrinkage. Then I began sensing the other mind making a tremendous effort to try and understand (!), and so I let the expression shrink a little more: I was obliged to let it shrink so as to make myself understood. And I followed all those phases of successive shrinkages. But at the time, the speech was very powerful: it was exactly Sri Aurobindo's style and way of speaking, and very powerful. Now it's only a vague impression, like a memory. But one always has ‚Äì always, in every case, even in the best conditions, even in a case like this one in which the formulation is given by Sri Aurobindo ‚Äì the sense of a shrinkage. A shrinkage in the sense that much escapes; it's slightly
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 292</p>
<p class="PE"> hardened, weakened, diminished, and there are also certain subtleties that escape ‚Äì they escape, they evaporate, they are too subtle to be concretized in words. And if one had a will for a perfect expression, it would certainly be very disappointing. I quite understand; if you want your book to reach the peak of its perfection, it's impossible. It's impossible to be realized, one feels the difference with what's up above and that's very disappointing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1767"><em>I am constantly disappointed.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1768"><em>(Mother laughs)</em> Yes, that doesn't surprise me!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1772"><em>(Mother laughs)</em> Oh, I see! oh, that's why!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1773"><em>I could stay up above forever.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1774">But in what I've read of yours (I set apart the book on Sri Aurobindo because that was a very special case: all sensitive people have instantly been brought into contact with Sri Aurobindo; that was a very special case), but in your first book <em>[The Goldwasher]</em> which I read, I felt it came from above. I feel that. Only, of course, it would be unreadable: it has to be concretized, materialized. But if one has oneself a relationship with this plane above, one must feel it in what is written: many people feel a ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that suffuses the whole thing. That's why I want you to read me your new book, it's to see if ‚Äúthat‚Äù is there.... You know, I am like this <em>(gesture to the forehead showing a vast stillness)</em>, it has become a constant state: a screen. A screen ‚Äì for absolutely everything. And really nothing comes from within: it's either this way <em>(horizontal gesture around Mother)</em> or this way <em>(gesture from above);</em> horizontally from outside, or the response from above. Here <em>(gesture to the level of the emotive heart)</em>, it's something so neutral as to be nonexistent; and here <em>(gesture to the forehead)</em>, it's vast, even, still. So if I stop <em>(gesture turned upward)</em>, right away, instantly, it comes in waves: a continuous light which
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 293</p>
<p class="PE"> comes down and through, comes down and through, comes down <em>... (gesture of a circulation through Mother as through a transmitter-receiver device)</em>. When something is read out to me or people ask me questions or they tell me about some matter or other, it's always like that (a screen). And what's very interesting is that when it's a question that deserves no answer or a matter that doesn't require my intervention, or anyway anything that can be expressed by ‚ÄúIt's no concern of mine, it's none of my business,‚Äù then there's an absolute <em>blank:</em> absolutely empty, neutral, without answer. I am obliged to say that there is no answer (if I were to tell the truth I should say, ‚ÄúI can't hear anything, I don't understand‚Äù). So it's absolutely still and neutral, and if it remains like that, it means there's nothing, I have nothing to do with it. Otherwise, when there is an answer... no time even elapses, there's hardly any lapse of time: the answer seems to come even as I am spoken to. Then I take the paper or letter right away and answer. It's automatic. The whole work is done like that. There's nothing here <em>(gesture to the forehead)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1775">Obviously we have to reconcile ourselves to it. The world is in a state of considerable imperfection, so everything that manifests in the world partakes of that imperfection ‚Äì what can we do about it?... The only thing we can do is to slowly try and transform ‚Äì but that's slow, so slow, unceasing ‚Äì transform this body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1776">And as Sri Aurobindo very well put it (I understand quite well what he means), miracles do occur, but they are momentary; that is, for the space of a few minutes, sometimes a few hours (but that's rare), things are wholly different. But they don't remain that way ‚Äì they don't, they go back to the old movement. Because <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> must have reached a certain degree (I suppose), a certain degree of receptivity, of preparation in the receptivity, so ‚Äúthat‚Äù may be established; otherwise, the old movement and the old law continue.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1777">I can see that with the body's cells: at times, for a few seconds or a few minutes (at the most a few hours, but not with physical things; with physical things, it's always seconds and minutes), all of a sudden a sort of perfection manifests ‚Äì and then it disappears. And you see very clearly that it cannot stay on because of a ceaseless invasion of everything around, which is imperfect. So then, it's engulfed. Like the first day when the supramental forces descended [in 1956]: I saw them descend, you know, and I saw those great billows of earth forces going brrf! brrf! <em>(gesture of rising and engulfing)</em>, and then it was all swallowed up. It was descending
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 294</p>
<p class="PE"> in awesome masses, but those billows were still more awesome, rising, brrf! and swallowing ‚Äì and That disappeared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1778">It still remains like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1779">It's still there. It's there and working, but... the opposing vibrations are still too powerful and too considerable in quantity for That not to disappear in the mass. But from within It works and works....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1780">That's how it is with the body: for a few seconds, at most a few minutes, the body suddenly feels in a state of irresistible power, inexpressible joy, undarkened luminousness ‚Äì a wonder, you know. You say to yourself, ‚ÄúAh, there we are!‚Äù And then it vanishes. It's there just long enough for you to notice it. Which means it comes to show you, ‚ÄúThat's how it is, that's how it will be.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1781">Yes, but when it is like that, we'll notice it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1782">But how is this fixity going to be changed into a plasticity sufficient to express what's within?... Sri Aurobindo said three hundred years ‚Äì that seems to me very much on the short side. There are millennia of habits! It's fixed, hard, dry, thin.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1783">And naturally, it's the same thing in the Mind, but to a much lesser degree. Fortunately, it's a little more fluid there.... But you know, when I receive and note down those things from above, at the time of receiving and noting them down, they have an intense luminosity and an extraordinary power of conviction. I note them down, then pass them on to people (and to people who are supposedly able to understand), and then they say it back to me [their inner reaction comes back to Mother]. Mon petit! It becomes... (laughing) like the bark of an old, half-dead tree!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1784">That's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1785">So you really wonder: Has the time come to tell things? What's the use?... They think they've understood; not only do they think they've understood, but they are enthusiastic, which means it has made them make some progress ‚Äì so where were they before!? And it's nothing, what they've understood is nothing, it has become a caricature of the thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1786">I realize that words in themselves are nothing; there, there was a power... a power that words are incapable of holding! So unless one receives directly, one receives nothing. One does receive, yes, but it's something like an onion skin.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1787">Basically, when we have reached the end (the ‚Äúend‚Äù which is the
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 295</p>
<p class="PE"> beginning of something else), the end of this work of transformation, when it really is the transformation and we are settled in it, maybe we'll remember and derive a special pleasure from remembering having gone through this?... In the ‚Äúhigher spheres‚Äù it has always been said that those who have the courage to come for the preparation will have, when it's done, superior assets and of a more intimate and deeper quality than those who will have quietly waited for others to do the work for them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1788">It may be so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1789">At any rate, because of the immensity of the work to be done, from an outward standpoint it looks like a quite thankless task. But that's only a purely superficial vision. Waves come to me like that from the world, from a whole class of the manifestation, saying, ‚ÄúAh, no! I don't want to bother about that, I just want to live peacefully, as well as I can. We'll see once the world has been transformed, then we can start bothering about it.‚Äù And that's among the most developed classes, the most intellectual, they are like that: ‚ÄúOh, very well, we'll see when it's done.‚Äù Which means they don't have the spirit of sacrifice. That's what Sri Aurobindo says (I keep coming across quotations from Sri Aurobindo all the time), he says that to do the Work one must have the spirit of sacrifice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1790">But it's true that, for instance, those few seconds (which come to me now and then and with increasing frequency), if you look at those few seconds calmly, well, they're worth a great deal of effort. Having that is worth quite a few years of struggle and effort, because that... is beyond anything perceptible, comprehensible, even beyond anything possible for life as it is now. It's... it's unimaginable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1791">And there is a real grace there, it's that it keeps you in a certain state as a result of which life as it is, things as they are, do not appear worse after those few seconds. There isn't, after them, that sort of horror of falling back into an abyss: there isn't that, you don't have that feeling.

For my part, I see things very differently, never in that way. I am always surprised at the way people see things. To me, it's completely different, it's... the Lord's Vibration crystallizing. That's all. And always, always ‚Äì at all times. So there's no ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù no ‚Äúhow‚Äù ‚Äì it's very simple, elementary in its simplicity. But I couldn't tell him that, he wouldn't have understood. So I looked at it from his standpoint, and all of a sudden I saw; I said, ‚ÄúYes indeed, how did this come about?‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> So I answered him (I don't remember the words I used, but in substance): The protection acts on the entire group when it works in a coordinated and disciplined way, but if individuals in it have an action <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INDEPENDENT</span> of the group, then they fall back into their own determinism, which means that the protection acts according to their personal faith, not at all as something collective: according to their personal state and faith, the action of the protection is greater or lesser.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1811">I saw it was clearly that. I saw how it had happened (because his question made me look at it, so I saw).

But anyway, they were outside the group, it was an action that had nothing to do with the group, and they did it because they were to rejoin the group at a precise time and they were late. So it was clearly an individual outgrowth. Walking round the pond would have taken three hours while there were hardly two hours left before nightfall, and they were in a jungle, without any light or anything. That was another impossibility. So with his reason and human common sense, he said, ‚ÄúThe best is to swim across.‚Äù But he hadn't foreseen (that was the reckless part) that the water would be icy.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1837">I am a little sad, naturally, because I tried to write with the best of my soul, but I am not attached and am ready to make the offering of this failure at your feet, with the certainty that all is well, even if I do not yet see the Lord's design.

<p class="Ps">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="Ps">Have you anything to tell me?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1847"><em>I wondered how a false expression (because it's false, I feel all this expression is false), how it could be worthwhile salvaging this false expression? Is it worth correcting and doing all this work when I feel this expression not to be the true one? Can it still be useful?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1848">The problem isn't like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1849">Certainly you must have observed two things: first the differences of condition while you wrote, and also a difference of ‚Äúpressure‚Äù among the things that wanted you to write them. You must have noted these differences while writing?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1850"><em>Yes, certainly.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1851">That's how it is. So then, once it's objectified on paper, you can become aware of the relationship between the pressure you received and the things you wrote, which have varying qualities. When, for instance, you read me those few pages, with certain things I saw the Light behind; with others, it was like a horizontal origin or will <em>(horizontal gesture at forehead level)</em>, and it was very pretty, very fine (you understand, I am not looking at it from the literary standpoint at all, or even the standpoint of the beauty of the form, that's not it). It's the quality of the vibration in what's written. And while you were reading to me, I felt the two origins, and I felt a sort of conflict between what came like this <em>(gesture from above)</em> and what came out of habit, like that <em>(horizontal gesture to the forehead)</em>: it was especially an old habit, something that came from the past and belonged to a mental, artistic, literary region
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 303</p>
<p class="PE"> (all that likes the form, likes certain emotions, certain expressions, all that). And it all constituted a horizontal world that exerted a pressure to be expressed, mostly out of habit, but also with a sort of will to be, a will to last. The other way was a Light falling and expressing itself quite naturally ‚Äì spontaneously, effortlessly, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNCONCERNED WITH THE EXTERNAL FORM</span>. And that was much more direct in its expression. But of course, the distinction isn't clear-cut, it's not easy to say, ‚ÄúOh, this comes from here <em>(gesture to a particular level)</em>, oh, that comes from there <em>(gesture to another level).‚Äù</em> But there is a movement above and another below.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1852">So I think the ‚Äúsadhana‚Äù would consist in sifting it out, or rather in developing a sensitivity such that the difference would become clear, quite perceptible, so it would no longer be the mind that chose and said, ‚ÄúThis is all right, that isn't.‚Äù There would be a spontaneous adherence to what is clothed in this light from above and a rejection of what isn't. The sadhana would consist in developing this sensitivity by separating yourself from the old movement, by taking the old movement outside you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1853"><em>I understand quite well, your letter was a grace for me in the sense that I saw clearly. The only thing is, it's the whole book that I find... inadequate.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1854">Yes, I think the whole book is like that. I don't know, you haven't read everything to me, but in what you read, in that dream notation, for instance, even there, now and then I felt the intrusion of the old habit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1855"><em>But then, is it worth salvaging all that? I would have to re-create the book.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1856">You mean it would be better to write another book?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1857"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1858">I told you: ‚ÄúThe book <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> be written,‚Äù but it's not necessarily the one that has been written: it's the one that must be written! <em>(Mother laughs)</em>. To me, you understand, there is a difference. ‚ÄúSomewhere‚Äù there is something that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> be said, and that something is very useful: I see that the people, for example, who have come to place trust in you because of the book on Sri Aurobindo, will read you with an opening of mind, and if at that time you give
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 304</p>
<p class="PE"> them a sort of sensation of the experience, it will help them a lot. It's in that sense I say this book is useful. But for you personally, if you'd rather rewrite it completely than correct it, it doesn't matter.... Only, for you to be capable of rewriting it without falling back into the old state, you must have a decisive awareness of the difference in condition. Suppose you said, ‚ÄúI'll rewrite the book,‚Äù and once you started writing the same conflict recurred, that would be useless.... Something must take place there, in the mind, that's where you must become totally conscious of the vibrations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1859"><em>I see fairly clearly all that must be cut out.... But there's a lot to cut out!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1860">You see clearly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1861"><em>Yes, but I feel almost everything should be cut out. It's a whole way of saying things...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1862">Ah, it's especially a way ‚Äì a way of feeling, a way of thinking.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1863">But from the standpoint of external form, the question remains of which method is easier: using the already written text, or writing everything anew. Writing everything anew... You understand, unless you are the master of your activity...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1864"><em>Yes, I am going to fall back into the same conflict.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1865">It's no use.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1867">Yes, I think it's better to correct it. It may not be very enjoyable, but from the point of view of mental discipline it's very useful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1868"><em>I really feel your letter as a grace, because as for me I'd toss everything out.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1869"><em>No!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1870"><em>You've made me see how false it was.</em></p>

<p class="p-num">Page 305</p>
<p class="PE"> to say, you mustn't receive the thing ‚Äúas it comes‚Äù and write it ‚Äúas it comes.‚Äù You must receive the inspiration and be conscious of the phenomenon of expression. Then it will be perfect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1872"><em>I was in the habit of being motionless and letting things flow down.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1873">Yes, but your mind is active ‚Äì the mind is active. You see, Sri Aurobindo could do it because his mind no longer existed; it was perfectly, perfectly still and inspiration went through it as through pure air. But your mind... In fact, that's the discipline you have to do, because your mind is in the habit of becoming active again. It's good if what comes from above goes through like that, but on condition that the mind be perfectly still. If you like, to put things differently, it's to learn to keep your mind still, while writing at the same time.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1896">I think that's why I am becoming deaf! It's because I am constantly listening there <em>(gesture turned upward)</em>, all the time. So I am not listening enough here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1897">It's the same thing with my eyes.... I have started seeing things with my eyes open, and, oh!... People's state, their thoughts, and especially the state of their vital (because it's a vision of the physical, a very subtle, very vitalized physical, and it's a representation of things in pictures). And their state shows itself as... if you knew <em>(Mother laughs)</em> the things one can see!... A myriad of forms, faces, expressions. You'd think it's an album by the sharpest humorist imaginable. It's extraordinarily humorous and sharp in the perception and the sense of how ridiculous people are. Then, in the middle of all that, suddenly a beautiful form, a beautiful picture, a beautiful expression appears; something so beautiful, so pure, so wonderfully noble! And it all turns round and round, constantly. It's very amusing, really.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1898">I had always complained it was a realm in which I didn't see. I mostly saw (in the past), I mostly saw mentally ‚Äì mental visions ‚Äì and also, naturally, I saw all the way up (but that was organized), and to some extent in the vital, especially at night, but anyway... The vision was highly developed, very clear and precise, but physically (‚Äúphysically,‚Äù I mean in the subtle physical and physically), I had never seen with open eyes: I always saw the stark reality as it is, never anything else, and I had always complained about it. Until suddenly it came: one day I started seeing, and then...! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> Now I am obliged to calm it down, because <em>(laughing)</em> it's too much. But it's unbelievable ‚Äì unbelievable how full of forms the air is, and such expressive forms!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1899">And I think that's what people see when they have what medical science calls ‚Äúhallucinations,‚Äù when they have a fever, for instance.

<p class="p-num">Page 309</p>
<p class="PE"> of all the hostile beings rushing to attack me from every side ‚Äì it was frightful! You understand, it's the support of the material consciousness that's no longer there, you are wholly in that vision, and that's why you generally get frightened, while others believe it's a ‚Äúhallucination.‚Äù I remember (Sri Aurobindo was there), at the time I told him, ‚ÄúAh, now I know what hallucinations caused by fever are.‚Äù ‚Äì It has nothing to do with hallucinations! But it's not pleasant, it's the vision of a world that's not pretty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1900">But now, it's not the result of fever, it's simply the vision I have. But then...! As I said, there's anything and everything there, all possibilities; and probably because of the quality of the aura [of Mother], I haven't seen anything really unclean or ugly. But it must exist ‚Äì it must exist, but it doesn't get in.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1901">But what one sees is the work of a priceless humorist! Things... like men's great ambitions, for example, also their self-satisfaction, the opinion they have of themselves, oh, it's all so comical! Those lives are shown in relation to (and, so to speak, in contact with) the Truth-Light, and then the difference between people's movement (or thought or attitude or action, or state of consciousness) and the Truth, the state of Truth, becomes plain to see, oh, if you knew!... But it's not seen by someone severe or harsh, no, no! It's seen by someone very sharp ‚Äì very sharp ‚Äì with a wonderful sense of humor and a charming irony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1902">It swarms and swarms....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV7-1907">Sri Aurobindo also said, ‚ÄúThere will first come the power to prolong life at will‚Äù (it's far more subtle and marvelous than that). But that's a state of consciousness which is now being established: it's a sort of constant and settled relationship and contact with the supreme Lord, which abolishes the sense of wear and tear; it replaces it with a sort of extraordinary flexibility, an extraordinary plasticity. But the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SPONTANEOUS</span> state of immortality isn't possible ‚Äì at least not for the time being. This structure must be changed into something else, and judging from the way things are going on, it will take a long time before it's changed into something else. It may go much faster than in the past, but even assuming that the movement is speeding up, it still takes time (according to our notion of time). And the rather remarkable thing is that to be in the state of consciousness in which wear and tear no longer exists, you must change your sense of time: you enter a state in which time no longer has the same reality. It's something else. It's very peculiar... it's an innumerable present. I don't know....
