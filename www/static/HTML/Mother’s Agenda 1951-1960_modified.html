<h2>Mother's Agenda</h2>
<h3>1951 - 1973</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document ‚Äî 6,000 pages in 13 volumes ‚Äî is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death ‚Äî upon the very power that changes death ‚Äî and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="Q"> When we have passed beyond humanity, then we shall be the Man.</p>
<p class="Q">Sri Aurobindo</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-5"><em>This <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AGENDA</span>... One day, another species among men will pore over this fabulous document as over the tumultuous drama that must have surrounded the birth of the first man among the hostile hordes of a great, delirious Paleozoic. A first man is the dangerous contradiction of a certain simian logic, a threat to the established order that so genteelly ran about amid the high, indefeasible ferns ‚Äì and to begin with, it does not even know that it is a man. It wonders, indeed, what it is. Even to itself it is strange, distressing. It does not even know how to climb trees any longer in its usual way ‚Äì and it is terribly disturbing for all those who still climb trees in the old, millennial way. Perhaps it is even a heresy. Unless it is some cerebral disorder? A first man in his little clearing had to have a great deal of courage. Even this little clearing was no longer so sure. A first man is a perpetual question. What am I, then, in the midst of all that? And where is my law? What is the law? And what if there were no more laws?... It is terrifying. Mathematics ‚Äì out of order. Astronomy and biology, too, are beginning to respond to mysterious influences. A tiny point huddled in the center of the world's great clearing. But what is all this, what if I were ‚Äúmad‚Äù? And then, claws all around, a lot of claws against this uncommon creature. A first man... is very much alone. He is quite unbearable for the pre-human ‚Äúreason.‚Äù And the surrounding tribes growled like red monkeys in the twilight of Guiana</em>.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page12">Page 12</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-6"><em> One day, we were like this first man in the great, stridulant night of the Oyapock. Our heart was beating with the rediscovery of a very ancient mystery ‚Äì suddenly, it was absolutely new to be a man amidst the diorite cascades and the pretty red and black coral snakes slithering beneath the leaves. It was even more extraordinary to be a man than our old confirmed tribes, with their infallible equations and imprescriptible biologies, could ever have dreamed. It was an absolutely uncertain ‚Äúquantum‚Äù that delightfully eluded whatever one thought of it, including perhaps what even the scholars thought of it. It flowed otherwise, it felt otherwise. It lived in a kind of flawless continuity with the sap of the giant balata trees, the cry of the macaws and the scintillating water of a little fountain. It ‚Äúunderstood‚Äù in a very different way. To understand was to be in everything. Just a quiver, and one was in the skin of a little iguana in distress. The skin of the world was very vast. To be a man after rediscovering a million years was mysteriously like being something still other than man, a strange, unfinished possibility that could also be all kinds of other things. It was not in the dictionary, it was fluid and boundless ‚Äì it had become a man through habit, but in truth, it was formidably virgin, as if all the old laws belonged to laggard barbarians. Then other moons began whirring through the skies to the cry of macaws at sunset, another rhythm was born that was strangely in tune with the rhythm of all, making one single flow of the world, and there we went, lightly, as if the body had never had any weight other than that of our human thought; and the stars were so near, even the giant airplanes roaring overhead seemed vain artifices beneath smiling galaxies. A man was the overwhelming Possible. He was even the great discoverer of the Possible. Never had this precarious invention had any other aim through millions of species than to discover that which surpassed his own species, perhaps the means to change his species ‚Äì a light and lawless species. After rediscovering a million years in the great, rhythmic night, a man was still something to be invented. It was the invention of himself, where all was not yet said and done</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-7"><em>And then, and then... a singular air, an incurable lightness, was beginning to fill his lungs. And what if we were a fable? And what are the means?</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-9"><em>A great and solemn good riddance to all our barbarous solemnities</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-10"><em>Thus had we mused in the heart of our ancient forest while we</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-11"><em>were still hesitating between unlikely flakes of gold and a civilization that seemed to us quite toxic and obsolete, however mathematical.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-12"><em>It was at this point that we met Mother, at this intersection of the anthropoid rediscovered and the ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that had set in motion this unfinished invention momentarily ensnared in a gilded machine.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-14"><em>A little white silhouette, twelve thousand miles away, solitary and frail amidst a spiritual horde which had once and for all decided that the meditating and miraculous yogi was the apogee of the species, was searching for the means, for the reality of this man who for a moment believes himself sovereign of the heavens or sovereign of a machine, but who is quite probably something completely different than his spiritual or material glories. Another, a lighter air was throbbing in that breast, unburdened of its heavens and of its prehistoric machines. Another Epic was beginning. Would Matter and Spirit meet, then, in a third <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSIOLOGICAL</span> position that would perhaps be at last the position of Man rediscovered, the something that had for so long fought and suffered in quest of becoming its own species?

But then we come to realize that the best is only the pretty muzzle of our worst, the same old beast defending itself, with all its claws out, with its sanctity or its electronic gadgets. Mother was there for something else</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-16"><em>‚ÄúSomething else‚Äù is ominous, perilous, disrupting ‚Äì it is quite unbearable for all those who resemble the old beast. The story of the Pondicherry ‚ÄúAshram‚Äù is the story of an old clan ferociously clinging to its ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù privileges, as others clung to the muscles that had made them kings among the great apes. It is armed with all the piousness and all the reasonableness that had made logical</em></p>

The spiritual brain is probably the worst obstacle to the new species, as were the muscles of the old orangutan for this fragile stranger who no longer climbed so well in the trees and sat, pensive, at the center of a little, uncertain clearing. There is nothing more pious than the old species. There is nothing more legal. Mother was searching for the path of the new species as much against all the virtues of the old as against all its vices or laws. For, in truth, ‚ÄúSomething Else‚Äù... is something else</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-18"><em>We landed there, one day in February 1954, having emerged from our Guianese forest and a certain number of dead-end peripluses; we had knocked upon all the doors of the old world before reaching that point of absolute impossibility where it was truly necessary to embark into something else or once and for all put a bullet through the brain of this slightly superior ape. The first thing that struck us was this exotic Notre Dame with its burning incense sticks, its effigies and its prostrations in immaculate white: a Church. We nearly jumped into the first train out that very evening, bound straight for the Himalayas, or the devil. But we remained near Mother for nineteen years. What was it, then, that could have held us there? We had not left Guiana to become a little saint in white or to enter some new religion. ‚ÄúI did not come upon earth to found an ashram; that would have been a poor aim indeed,‚Äù She wrote in 1934. What did all this mean, then, this ‚ÄúAshram‚Äù that was already registered as the owner of a great spiritual business, and this fragile, little silhouette at the center of all these zealous worshippers? In truth, there is no better way to smother someone than to worship him: he chokes beneath the weight of worship, which moreover gives the worshipper claim to ownership. ‚ÄúWhy do you want to worship?‚Äù She exclaimed. ‚ÄúYou have but to become! It is the laziness to become that makes one worship.‚Äù She wanted so much to make them</em> become <em>this ‚Äúsomething else,‚Äù but it was far easier to worship and quiescently remain what one was. She spoke to deaf ears. She was very alone in this ‚Äúashram.‚Äù Little by little, the disciples fill up the place, then they say: it is ours. It is ‚Äúthe Ashram.‚Äù We are ‚Äúthe disciples.‚Äù In Pondicherry as in Rome as in Mecca. ‚ÄúI do not want a religion! An end to religions!‚Äù She exclaimed. She struggled and fought in their midst ‚Äì was She therefore to leave this Earth like one more saint or yogi, buried beneath haloes, the ‚Äúcontinuatrice‚Äù of a great spiritual lineage? She was seventy-six years old when we landed there, a knife in our belt and a ready curse on our lips</em>.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-20"><em>No, She was not the ‚ÄúMother of the Pondicherry Ashram.‚Äù Then who was She?... We discovered Her step by step, as one discovers a forest, or rather as one fights with it, machete in hand ‚Äì and then it melts, one loves, so sublime does it become. Mother grew beneath our skin like an adventure of life and death. For seven years we fought with Her. It was fascinating, detestable, powerful and sweet; we felt like screaming and biting, fleeing and always coming back: ‚ÄúAh! You won't catch me! If you think I came here to worship you, you're wrong!‚Äù And She laughed. She always laughed. We had our bellyful of adventure at last: if you go astray in the forest, you get delightfully lost yet still with the same old skin on your back, whereas here, there is nothing left to get lost in! It is no longer just a matter of getting lost ‚Äì you have to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CHANGE</span> your skin. Or die. Yes, change species. Or become one more nauseating little worshipper ‚Äì which was not on our program. ‚ÄúWe are the enemy of our own conception of the Divine,‚Äù She told us one day with her mischievous little smile. The whole time ‚Äì or for seven years, in any event ‚Äì we fought with our conception of God and the ‚Äúspiritual life‚Äù: it was all so comfortable, for we had a supreme ‚Äúsymbol‚Äù of it right there. She let us do as we pleased, She even opened up all kinds of little heavens in us, along with a few hells, since they go together. She even opened the door in us to a certain ‚Äúliberation,‚Äù which in the end was as soporific as eternity ‚Äì but there was nowhere to get out: it</em> WAS <em>eternity. We were trapped on all sides. There was nothing left but these 4m2 of skin, the last refuge, that which we wanted to flee by way of above or below, by way of Guiana or the Himalayas. She was waiting for us just there, at the end of our spiritual or not so spiritual pirouettes. Matter was her concern. It took us seven years to understand that She was beginning there, ‚Äúwhere the other yogas leave off,‚Äù as Sri Aurobindo had already said twenty-five years earlier. It was necessary to have covered all the paths of the Spirit and all those of Matter, or in any case a large number geographically, before discovering, or even simply understanding, that ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù was really Something Else. It was not an improved Spirit nor even an improved Matter, but... it could be called ‚Äúnothing,‚Äù so contrary was it to all we know. For the caterpillar, a butterfly is nothing, it is not even visible and has nothing in common with caterpillar heavens nor even caterpillar matter. So there we were, trapped in an impossible adventure. One does not return from there: one must cross the bridge to the other side. Then one day in that seventh year, while</em></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="topographical-note">Topographical Note</h1>
<p class="PE"> From the time of Sri Aurobindo's departure (1950) until 1957, we have only a few notes and fragments or rare statements noted from memory. These are the only landmarks of this period, along with Mother's <em>Questions and Answers</em> from her talks at the Ashram Playground. A few of these conversations have been reproduced here insofar as they mark stages of the Supramental Action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-37">From 1957, Mother received us twice a week in the office of Pavitra, the most senior of the French disciples, on the second floor of the main Ashram building, on some pretext of work or other. She listened to our queries, spoke to us at length of yoga, occultism, her past experiences in Algeria and in France or of her current experiences; and gradually, She opened the mind of the rebellious and materialistic Westerner that we were and made us understand the laws of the worlds, the play of forces, the working of past lives ‚Äì especially this latter, which was an important factor in the difficulties with which we were struggling at that time and which periodically made us abscond. Mother would be seated in this rather medieval-looking chair with its high, carved back, her feet on a little tabouret, while we sat on the floor, on a slightly faded carpet, conquered and seduced, revolted and never satisfied ‚Äì but nevertheless, very interested. Treasures, never noted down, were lost until, with the cunning of the Sioux, we succeeded in making Mother consent to the presence of a tape recorder. But even then, and for a long time thereafter, She carefully made us erase or delete in our notes all that concerned Her rather too personally ‚Äì sometimes we disobeyed Her.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page22">Page 22</p>
<p class="PE"> But finally we were able to convince Her of the value inherent in keeping a chronicle of the route.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-38">It was only in 1958 that we began having the first tape-recorded conversations, which, properly speaking, constitute Mother's <em>Agenda</em>. But even then, many of these conversations were lost or only partly noted down. Or else we considered that our own words should not figure in these notes and we carefully omitted all our questions ‚Äì which was absurd. At that time, no one ‚Äì neither Mother, nor ourself ‚Äì knew that this was ‚Äúthe Agenda‚Äù and that we were out to explore the ‚ÄúGreat Passage.‚Äù Only gradually did we become aware of the true nature of these meetings. Furthermore, we were constantly on the road, so much so that there are sizable gaps in the text. In fact, for seven years, Mother was patiently preparing the instrument that would be able to traverse the adventure without breaking along the way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-39">From 1960, the <em>Agenda</em> took its final shape and grew for thirteen years, until May 1973, filling thirteen volumes in all (some six thousand pages), with a change of setting in March 1962 at the time of the Great Turning in Mother's yoga when She permanently retired to her room upstairs, as had Sri Aurobindo in 1926. The interviews then took place high up in this large room carpeted in golden wool, like a ship's stateroom, amidst the rustling of the Copper Pod tree and the cawing of crows. Mother would sit in a low rosewood chair, her face turned towards Sri Aurobindo's tomb, as though She were wearing down the distance separating that world from our own. Her voice had become like that of a child, one could hear her laughter. She always laughed, this Mother. And then her long silences. Until the day the disciples closed her door on us. It was May 19, 1973. We did not want to believe it. She was alone, just as we were suddenly alone. Slowly, painfully, we had to discover the why of this rupture. We understood nothing of the jealousies of the old species, we did not yet realize that they were becoming the ‚Äúowners‚Äù of Mother ‚Äì of the Ashram, of Auroville, of Sri Aurobindo, of everything ‚Äì and that the new world was going to be denatured into a new Church. There and then, they made us understand why She had pulled us from our forest, one day, and chosen as her confidant an incurable rebel.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-50">It can further be said that whatever happens in the world is the result of divine will, but also that this will has to be expressed and manifested in a world that contradicts or deforms it; these are two attitudes having, respectively, the practical effect of either submitting with peace and joy to whatever happens or, on the contrary, ceaselessly fighting for the triumph of what should be. To live the truth one must know how to rise above both attitudes and combine them.</p>

<p class="PE"> To acquire a total and perfect awareness of the world as it is in all its details, one must first have no more personal reactions in regard to any of these details, nor even any spiritual preference as to what they ought to be. In other words, a total acceptance with a perfect neutrality and indifference is the indispensable condition for a knowledge through integral identification. If one detail, no matter how small, escapes this neutrality, this detail also escapes identification. The absence of personal reactions, whatever their end, even the most exalted, is thus a basic necessity for total knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-54">So we could say, paradoxically, that we can only know a thing when we are not interested in it, or rather, more precisely, when we are not personally concerned with it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-55">Whenever a god has donned a body, it was always with the intention of transforming the earth and creating a new world.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-56">But it is the very imperfection of the incarnate god that makes the perfection of those about him indispensable. If the god incarnate realized the perfection needed for the progress to be made, this progress would not be conditioned by the state of the surrounding matter. However, interdependence is doubtlessly absolute in this world of utmost objectification, and a certain degree of perfection in the general manifestation is indispensable before a higher degree of perfection can be realized in the divine, incarnate being. It is the need for a certain perfection in the environment that drives human beings to progress; it is the insufficiency of this progress, whatever it may be, that impels the divine being to intensify his effort for progress in his own body. Thus both movements for progress are simultaneous and complementary.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-57">When we look back upon our lives, we almost always feel that in some circumstance or other we could have done better, even though at each minute the action was dictated by the inner truth; this is because the universe is in perpetual motion, and what was perfectly true at one time is only partly so today. Or, to express it more precisely, the action necessary at the time it was carried out is no longer so at the present time, and another action might more fruitfully take its place.</p>
<p class="sec-br">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-58">When we speak of transformation, the meaning of the word is still vague to us. It gives us the impression of something that is going to happen which will set everything right. The idea more or less boils down to this: if we have difficulties, the difficulties will vanish; those who are ill will be cured of their illness; if the body has infirmities or incapacities, the infirmities or incapacities will fade away, and so forth... But as I have said, it is very vague, it is only an impression. Now, what is quite remarkable about the body consciousness is that it is unable to know a thing with precision and in all its details except when it is just about to be realized. Thus, when the process of transformation becomes clear, when we are able to know by what sequence of movements and changes the total transformation will take place, in what order, by which path, as it were, which things will come first, which will follow ‚Äì when everything is known, in all its details, it will be a sure indication that the hour of realization is near, for each time you perceive a detail accurately, it means that you are ready to carry it out.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-59">In the meantime, one can have an overall view. For example, it is quite certain that under the influence of the supramental light, the transformation of the body consciousness will take place first; then will come a progress in the mastery and control of all the movements and workings of all the body's organs; afterwards this</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page36">Page 36</p>
<p class="PE"> mastery will gradually change into a kind of radical modification of the movement and then of the constitution of the organ itself. All this is certain, although rather vague to our perception. But what will finally take place ‚Äì once the various organs are replaced by centers of concentration of forces, each with a different quality and nature and each acting according to its own special mode ‚Äì is still a mere conception, and the body does not understand very well, for it is still very far from the realization, and the body can really understand only when it is on the point of being able to do.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-69">My answer is ready.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-70">I knew you would ask me this question because it is indeed the most interesting thing in the whole passage ‚Äì so my answer is</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page38">Page 38</p>
<p class="PE"> ready, along with my answer to another question. But first let me read you this one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-71">You asked, ‚ÄúWhat is this Personality and when will She come?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-72">Here is my answer <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother reads)</em></span>:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-73">‚ÄúShe <em>has</em> come, bringing with Her a splendor of power and love, an intensity of divine joy heretofore unknown to the Earth. The physical atmosphere has been completely changed by her descent, permeated with new and marvelous possibilities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-74">But if She is ever to reside and act here, She has to find at least a minimal receptivity, at least <em>one</em> human being with the required vital and physical qualities, a kind of super-Parsifal gifted with an innate and integral purity, yet possessing at the same time a body strong enough and poised enough to bear unwaveringly the intensity of the Ananda She brings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-75">Thus far, She has not found what is needed. Men remain obstinately men and do not want to or are unable to become supermen. All they can receive and express is a love at their own dimension: a human love ‚Äì whereas the supreme bliss of divine Ananda eludes their perception.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-76">At times, finding the world unready to receive Her, She contemplates withdrawing. But how cruel a loss this would be!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-77">It is true that <em>at present</em>, her presence is more rhetorical than factual, since so far She has had no chance to manifest. Yet even so, She is a powerful instrument in the Work, for of all the Mother's aspects, She holds the greatest power to transform the body. Indeed, those cells which can vibrate at the touch of the divine Joy, receive it and bear it, are cells reborn, on their way to becoming immortal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-78">But the vibrations of divine Bliss and those of pleasure cannot cohabit in the same vital and physical house. We must therefore <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TOTALLY</span> renounce <em>all</em> feelings of pleasure to be ready to receive the divine Ananda. But rare are those who can renounce pleasure without thereby renouncing all active participation in life or sinking into a stern ascetism. And among those who realize that the transformation is to be wrought in active life, some pretend that pleasure is a form of Ananda gone more or less astray and legitimize their search for self-satisfaction, thereby creating a virtually insuperable obstacle to their own transformation.‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page39">Page 39</p>
<p class="PE"> Now, if there is anything else you wish to ask me... Anyone may ask, anyone ‚Äì anyone who has something to say ‚Äì not just the students.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-83"><em>But Mother, if She came down, She must have seen a possibility!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-84">She came down because there <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> a possibility ‚Äì because things had reached such a stage that it was her hour to come down. But in truth, She came down because... because I thought it was possible for her to succeed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-85">Possibilities are still there ‚Äì only they have to materialize.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-86">This is borne out by the fact that her descent took place at a given moment and for two or three weeks the atmosphere ‚Äì not only of the Ashram but of the Earth ‚Äì was so highly charged with such a power of such an intense divine Bliss creating so marvelous a force that things difficult to do before could be done almost instantly.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-90">But there was a formidable battle with the Inconscient, for when I saw that the level of receptivity was not what it should have been, I blamed the Inconscient... and tried to wage the battle there.</p>

It can be said that without a doubt the majority of young people here have come because it was promised them that they would be present at the Hour of Realization ‚Äì but they just don't remember it! <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs)</em></span> I have already said several times that when you come down on earth, you fall on your head, which leaves you a little dazed! <span class="note_1"><em>(laughter)</em></span> It's a pity, but after all, you don't have to remain dazed all your lives, do you?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-101">But actually, to tell you the truth, I think your lives are so easy that you don't exert yourselves very much! How many among you have truly an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INTENSE</span> need to find their psychic beings? To find out truly who they are? To find out what their roles are, why they are here?... You just let yourselves drift. You even complain when things aren't easy enough! You just take things as they come. And sometimes, should an aspiration arise in you and you encounter some difficulty in yourself, you say, ‚ÄúOh, Mother is there! She'll take care of it for me!‚Äù And you think about something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-102"><em>Mother, previously things were very strict in the Ashram, but not now. Why?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-103">Yes, I have always said that it changed when we had to take the very little children. How can you envision an ascetic life with little sprouts no bigger than that? It's impossible! But that's the little surprise package the war left on our doorstep. When it was found that Pondicherry was the safest place on earth, naturally people came wheeling in here with all their baby carriages filled and asked us if we could shelter them, so we couldn't very well turn them away, could we?! That's how it happened, and in no other way... But, in the beginning, the first condition for coming here was that you would have nothing more to do with your family! If a man was married, then he had to completely overlook the fact that he had a wife and children ‚Äì completely sever all ties, have nothing further to do with them. And if ever a wife asked to come just because her husband happened to be here, we told her, ‚ÄúYou have no business coming here!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-104">In the beginning, it was very, very strict ‚Äì for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-105">The first condition was: ‚ÄúNothing more to do with your family...‚Äù Well, we are a long way from that! But I repeat that it only happened because of the war and not because we stopped seeing the need to cut all family ties; on the contrary, this is an indispensable condition because as long as you hang on to all these cords which bind you to ordinary life, which make you a slave to the ordinary life, how can you possibly belong to the Divine alone? What childishness! It is simply not possible. If you have ever taken the trouble to read over the early ashram rules,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page42">Page 42</p>
<p class="PE"> you would find that even friendships were considered dangerous and undesirable... We made every effort to create an atmosphere in which only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> thing counted: <em>the Life Divine</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-106">But as I said, bit by bit... things changed. However, this had one advantage: we were too much outside of life. So there were a number of problems which had never arisen but which would have suddenly surged up the moment we wanted a complete manifestation. We took on all these problems a little prematurely, but it gave us the opportunity to solve them. In this way we learned many things and surmounted many difficulties, only it complicated things considerably. And in the present situation, given such a large number of elements who haven't even the slightest idea why they're here (!)... well, it demands a far greater effort on the disciples' part than before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-107">Before, when there were... we started with 35 or 36 people ‚Äì but even when it got up to 150, even with 150 ‚Äì it was as if... they were all nestled in a cocoon in my consciousness: they were so near to me that I could constantly guide <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL</span> their inner or outer movements. Day and night, at each moment, everything was totally under my control. And naturally, I think they made a great deal of progress at that time: it is a fact that I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANTLY</span> doing the <em>sadhana</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="12" href="#">3</a> for them. But then, with this baby boom... The sadhana can't be done for little sprouts who are 3 or 4 or 5 years old! It's out of the question. The only thing I can do is wrap them in the Consciousness and try to see that they grow up in the best of all possible conditions. However, the one advantage to all this is that instead of there being such a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">COMPLETE</span> and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PASSIVE</span> dependence on the disciples' part, each one has to make his own little effort. Truly, that's excellent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-108">I don't know to whom I was mentioning this today (I think it was for a Birthday<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="13" href="#">4</a>)... No, I don't know now.

When a little later I chanced upon Vivekananda's <em>Raja Yoga</em>, it really seemed so wonderful to me that someone could explain something to me! And it helped me realize in only a few months what would have otherwise taken years.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page43">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE"> I met a man (I was perhaps 20 or 21 at the time), an Indian who had come to Europe and who told me of the <em>Gita</em>. There was a French translation of it (a rather poor one, I must say) which he advised me to read, and then he gave me the key (<span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HIS</span> key, it was his key). He said, ‚ÄúRead the <em>Gita</em>...‚Äù (this translation of the <em>Gita</em> which really wasn't worth much but it was the only one available at the time ‚Äì in those days I wouldn't have understood anything in other languages; and besides, the English translations were just as bad and... well, Sri Aurobindo hadn't done his yet!). He said, ‚ÄúRead the <em>Gita</em> knowing that Krishna is the symbol of the immanent God, the God within.‚Äù That was all. ‚ÄúRead it with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> knowledge ‚Äì with the knowledge that Krishna represents the immanent God, the God within you.‚Äù Well, within a month, the whole thing was done!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-109">So some of you people have been here since the time you were toddlers ‚Äì everything has been explained to you, the whole thing has been served to you on a silver platter (not only with words, but through psychic aid and in every possible way), you have been put on the path of this inner discovery... and then you just go on drifting along: ‚ÄúWhen it comes, it will come.‚Äù ‚Äì If you even spare it that much thought!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-122">For Her, this body is but one instrument among so many others in an eternity of ages to come, and for Her its only importance is that attributed to it by the Earth and mankind ‚Äì the extent to which it can be used as a channel to further Her manifestation. If I find myself surrounded by people who are incapable of receiving Her, then for Her, I am quite useless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-123">It is very clear. So it is not I who can make Her stay. And I certainly cannot ask Her to stay for egotistical reasons. Moreover, all these Aspects, all these Personalities manifest constantly ‚Äì but they</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page45">Page 45</p>
<p class="PE"> never manifest for personal reason. Not one of them has ever thought of helping my body ‚Äì besides, I don't ask them to because that is not their purpose. But it is more than obvious that if the people around me were receptive, She could permanently manifest since they could receive Her ‚Äì and this would help my body enormously because all these vibrations would run through it. But She never gets even a chance to manifest ‚Äì not a single one. She only meets people... who don't even feel Her when She's there! They don't even notice Her, they're not even aware of her presence. So how can She manifest in these conditions? I'm not going to ask Her, ‚ÄúPlease come and change my body.‚Äù We don't have that kind of relationship! Furthermore, the body itself wouldn't agree. It never thinks of itself, it never pays attention to itself, and besides, it is only through the work that it can be transformed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-124">Yes, certainly... had there been any receptivity when She came down and had She been able to manifest with the power with which She came... But I can tell you one thing: even before Her coming, when, with Sri Aurobindo, I had begun going down (for the Yoga) from the mental plane to the vital plane, when we brought our yoga down from the mental plane into the vital plane, in less than a month (I was forty years old at the time ‚Äì I didn't seem very old, I looked less than forty, but I was forty anyway), after no more than a month of this yoga, I looked exactly like an 18 year old! And someone who knew me and had stayed with me in Japan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="15" href="#">6</a> came here, and when he saw me, he could scarcely believe his eyes! He said, ‚ÄúBut my god, is it you?‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-125">Only when we went down from the vital plane into the physical plane, all this went away ‚Äì because on the physical plane, the work is much harder and we had so much to do, so many things to change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-126">But if a force like Hers could manifest and be received here, it would have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INESTIMABLE</span> results!...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-127">Well, I am only telling you all this because I thought someone might ask me about it, but otherwise... I don't have that kind of relationship with Her. You see, if you consider this body, this poor body, it is very innocent: it in no way tries to draw attention to itself nor to attract forces nor to do anything at all except its</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page46">Page 46</p>
<p class="PE"> work ‚Äì as best it can. And that's how it stands: its importance is proportionate to its usefulness... and to the significance the world attributes to it ‚Äì since its action is for the world.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Pondicherry, April 4, 1955</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-134">Mother, for more than a year now I have been near you and nothing, no really significant inner experience, no sign has come that allows me to feel I have progressed or merely to show me that I am on the right path. I cannot even say I am happy.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page49">Page 49</p>
<p class="PE"> I am not so absurdly pretentious as to blame the divine, nor yourself ‚Äì and I remain quite convinced that all this is my own fault. Undoubtedly I have not known how to surrender totally in some part of myself, or I do not aspire enough or know how to ‚Äúopen‚Äù myself as needed. Also, I should rely entirely upon the divine to take care of my progress and not be concerned about the absence of experiences. I have therefore asked myself why I am so far away from the true attitude, the genuine opening, and I see two main reasons: on the one hand, the difficulties inherent in my own nature, and on the other, the outer conditions of this sadhana. These conditions do not seem to be conducive to helping me overcome the difficulties in my own nature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-135">I feel that I am turning in circles and taking one step backward for each one forward. Furthermore, instead of helping me draw nearer to the divine consciousness, my work in the Ashram (the very fact of working ‚Äì for to change work, even if I felt like it, would not change the overall situation), diverts me from this divine consciousness, or at least keeps me in a superficial consciousness from which I am unable to ‚Äúunglue‚Äù myself as long as I am busy writing letters, doing translations, corrections or classes.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="18" href="#">1</a> I know it's my own fault, that I ‚Äúshould‚Äù know how to be detached from my work and do it by relying upon a deeper consciousness, but what can be done? Unless I receive the grace, I cannot ‚Äúremember‚Äù the essential thing as long as the outer part of my being is active.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-136">When I am not immediately engrossed in work, I have to confront a thousand little temptations and daily difficulties that come from my contact with other beings and a life that does indeed remain in life. Here, even more, there is the feeling of an impossible struggle, and all these ‚Äúlittle‚Äù difficulties seem to gnaw away at me; scarcely has one hole been filled when another opens up, or the same one reappears, and there is never any real victory ‚Äì one has constantly to begin everything again. Finally, it seems to me that I really live <em>only one hour a day</em>, during the evening ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù at the playground.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="19" href="#">2</a> It is scarcely a life and scarcely a sadhana!</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page50">Page 50</p>
<p class="PE"> Consequently, I understand much better now why in the traditional yogas one ‚Äúsettled‚Äù all these difficulties once and for all by escaping from the world, without bothering to transform a life that seems so untransformable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-137">I am not now going to renounce Sri Aurobindo's Yoga, Mother, for my whole life is based upon it, but I believe I should employ other means ‚Äì which is why I am writing you this letter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-138">By continuing this daily little ant-like struggle and by having to confront the same desires, the same ‚Äúdistractions‚Äù every day, it seems to me I am wasting my energy in vain. Sri Aurobindo's Yoga, which is meant to include life, is so difficult that one should come to it only after having already established the solid base of a concrete divine realization. That is why I want to ask you if I should not ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù for a certain time, to Almora,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">3</a> for example, to Brewster's place,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="21" href="#">4</a> to live in solitude, silence, meditation, far away from people, work and temptations, until a beginning of Light and Realization is concretized in me. Once this solid base is acquired, it would be easier for me to resume my work and the struggle here for the true transformation of the outer being. But to want to transform this outer being without having fully illumined the inner being seems to me to be <em>putting the cart before the horse</em>, or at least condemning myself to a pitiless and endless battle in which the best of my forces are fruitlessly consumed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-139">In all sincerity, I must say that when I was at Brewster's place in Almora, I felt very near to that state in which the Light must surge forth. I quite understand the imperfection of this process, which involves fleeing from difficulties, but this would only be a stage, a strategic ‚Äúretreat,‚Äù as it were.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-140">Mother, this is not a vital desire seeking to divert me from the sadhana, for my life has no other meaning than to seek the divine, but it seems to be the only solution that could bring about some progress and get me out of this <em>lukewarm slump</em> in which I have been living day after day. I cannot be satisfied living merely one hour a day, when I see you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-141">I know that you do not like to write, Mother, but couldn't you say in a few words if you approve of my project or what I should do? In spite of all my rebellions and discouragements and resistances, I am your child. O Mother, help me!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-160">Mother... suddenly everything seems to have crystallized ‚Äì all the little revolts, the little tensions, the ill will and petty vital demands ‚Äì forming a single block of open, determined resistance. I have become conscious that from the beginning of my sadhana, the mind has led the game ‚Äì with the psychic behind ‚Äì and has ‚Äúheld me in leash,‚Äù helped muzzle all contrary movements, but at no time, or only rarely, has the vital submitted or opened to the higher influence. The rare times when the vital participated, I felt a great progress.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-161">Mother, I am sufficiently awakened not to rebel against your Light and to understand that the vital is but one part of my being, but I have come to the conclusion that the only way of ‚Äúconvincing‚Äù this vital is not to force or stifle it, but to let it go through its own experience so it may understand by itself that it cannot be satisfied in this way. I feel the need to leave the Ashram for a while to see how I can get along away from here ‚Äì and to realize, no doubt, that one can really breathe only here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-162">I have friends in Bangalore whom I would like to join for two or three weeks, perhaps more, perhaps less, however long it may take to confront this vital with its own freedom.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-174">Mother, after seeing you, I received a letter from my Bangalore friends. They have just bought an old Mogul residence and gardens in Hyderabad that used to belong to the Nizam... They suggest that their new property would be an enchanting setting for writing the book I have felt like writing for years but never wrote because I was always on the move. Anyway, they have made it clear that should I have qualms about staying with them too long, it would be easy for them to find me some lucrative work that would not be too time consuming ‚Äì which would allow me to write or do whatever I wish ‚Äì with their friend the Maharajah of Jaipur, or even in Hyderabad.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-175">All this tends to kindle something in me and ignites many temptations that correspond to very diverse, and not very satisfied, elements within me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-176">To complete the picture ‚Äì for I don't know what inspiration compels me to expose all this to you in such detail ‚Äì I must tell you that these friends are opium users and that opium has played an important role in my life and continues to exert a strong attraction over me, the attraction of oblivion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-177">So that's the situation. All this is in conflict within me and all the more so since it is happening now, in my present state of mind that you know so well.</p>

<p class="Q">Bangalore</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-182">Sweet Mother, during the three days since I left the Ashram, I have never ceased feeling your Presence deep within me like the one thing essential, the only thing solid in the midst of all these hazy appearances. As I entered more and more into this outer world, I seemed to be entering a world without depth, without consistency, where all sorts of things and beings were fluttering like a very thin veil in the wind; and as I entered into this wavering world, you seemed to grow within me with an irrefutable self-evidence, like the only real thing, my only reason to be in this world ‚Äì without you, everything withers away and loses its Meaning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-183">Mother, never before have I felt with such force how much you are part of me, nor how much I belong to you, irreversibly. And this I felt not only in my mind or even in my heart, but physically. Moreover, during the several weeks when I went through this latest ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù in the Ashram, it seemed to me, sweet Mother, that a physical link was being built between you and me. Am I wrong? At times, I had the feeling that you were no longer merely ‚ÄúMother‚Äù in Spirit, but rather my Mother, as if you had really brought me into the world physically and there was nothing foreign anymore in our relationship. My words are awkward, but you will know how to see the Truth behind them, even if this Truth is still obscure to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-184">I believed I had committed a spiritual ‚Äúerror‚Äù by leaving the Ashram. But now it seems to me that this experience was necessary, for it put me glaringly in the presence of my life's Meaning and its profound Reality. In a way, I needed to ‚Äúobjectify‚Äù my presence in the Ashram, to see it from the outside. Not that I believe these to be good or even bad reasons to mentally justify this flight, but I see no other reason for this departure. And I find myself here without any need to satisfy the least desire, as if all these worldly ‚Äúpleasures‚Äù no longer awaken anything at all in me. Your grace is there, surely. The only¬†</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page58">Page 58</p>
<p class="PE"> experience I have had is smoking opium. Before, I found it very refined and calming, but this time I found only stomach cramps and a joyless vapidity. It is strange, but I feel that nothing has a hold on me any longer and the only people who seem to be really <em>living</em> are those in the Ashram. The others, on the contrary, are only pretending and are all completely outside of life, however paradoxical that might appear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-185">Sweet Mother, my experience is over. Will you allow me to return to the Ashram towards the middle of next week? There is no more struggle or conflict in me, it is my entire being, right down to the physical, that needs you, that wants to return and aspires to serve you ‚Äì joyfully, peacefully. And not only do I aspire to serve you, but also to <em>fight</em> against these dark, ignorant and deceptive forces so as to be worthy of your Light, the true Light of my being. I see no other meaning for my life, for all life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-186">Mother, I know now what the word ‚Äúconsecration‚Äù means. I want to consecrate myself wholly to your work, with my heart, my mind, my body and my soul. I belong to you irrevocably, unreservedly. I know that nothing else exists in the world that is worthy of being lived, except you. This crisis has helped me to see into myself clearly, and I believe I have gained something from it. Or am I deluding myself?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-187">Finally, I would like to tell you how grateful I am, for I seem to feel your hand everywhere, your infinite understanding leading me towards your Light, through all the meanderings of my nature, making use of it and transforming it, uplifting it little by little in each of its elements and in the minutest details. Thank you, Mother, for letting me find you ‚Äì and forgive this terrible child who has been rebelling against the force of transformation, no doubt so as better to find you again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-188">I feel myself so much your child in every fiber of my being. Yes, your child.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-195">All artistic creation is born of a question, a conflict, a discord with oneself, mankind or the cosmos. What painter, what poet, what writer has not wrenched from this conflict the best of his art, from Michelangelo to Goya, from Van Gogh to Rodin, from Villon to Rimbaud, Baudelaire or Dostoevski? And the work of art ‚Äì the painting, novel or poem ‚Äì is a harmony torn from this disharmony, a conquest over some chaos, a response to a question posed by man ‚Äì a metamorphosis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-196">Artistic creation relies upon that which is most unique in man, most singular with respect to others, and it is through this singular uniqueness that the artist achieves his metamorphosis, his re-creation of the world; it is through this that he seeks to commune with others, himself and the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-197">Now, Yoga seeks to eliminate conflict, problems or questions. Man has to forget all this, to cease being a question.</p>

<p class="PE"> So when an answer has been given to every question, what place remains for the work of art? When all is metamorphosized through Transcendence, what place remains for artistic metamorphosis? When all is supreme harmony, can this harmony be expressed otherwise than through silence, a smile, a radiance or ‚Äúinspired‚Äù poetry ‚Äì of which Sri Aurobindo is the <em>sole</em> example; even so, his poetry is not drawn from the human level, it surpasses the human, it issues from <em>elsewhere</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-198">Must artistic creation cease being human, then; must it cease relying upon the human? ‚Äì which would then mean having to reject so many undeniably great painters, poets or writers? Must one wait to be open to the supramental planes of consciousness before being able to reconcile (assuming such reconciliation is possible) yoga and artistic creation? And, until then, smother all that sustains the creative √©lan, i.e. the individual, the conflict, that part of oneself which every creator feels to be the purest human part? Must one extinguish in oneself this play of light and shadow from which art derives its highest accents?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-199">Mother, I need to unburden myself of all that is wringing my heart, and if the Divine exists somewhere, it is to him that I would like to express my profound disgust. For all this is profoundly scandalous, absurd and revolting. I know that the external world is absurd and that men live in it vainly; but the world of the Ashram is no less absurd, no less vain. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äù is making fun of us, ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù is deceiving us ‚Äì for if truly there is some witness to this tragi-comedy and if this whole world is his ‚Äúgame,‚Äù it is a cruel game and he is a cheater, for he has all the cards in his hand and he pretends to make us play a game in which we are</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page65">Page 65</p>
<p class="PE"> inevitably the losers ‚Äì a game we cannot play, for we are helpless, miserable, without strength, without light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-200">All our efforts are vain and sadly ridiculous. At each instant we must begin everything anew, one step seems to lead us forward, another to draw us back. We desperately turn in circles and sometimes, in our dizziness, we believe we glimpse lights, but these are only the little, dancing lights of our own fatigue, our own weakness. There is no victory, there are only moments of respite. Meditation brings calm and peace, of course, but so does sleep. We are all seeking release, in love, in opium, in action, in war or in power ‚Äì or in Yoga; but one means is just as vain as the other. There is no real solution, there are only more or less effective ways of forgetting for an hour, or a day, that we are men, alone and helpless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-201">It is quite possible, even quite probable, that in another hour or another day, I may feel quite the contrary of what I now write. But the person I am tomorrow does not <em>negate</em> he who I am today, it only makes him more absurd, more unbearably absurd. The one who I am right now, for an hour perhaps, needs to cry out his disgust with this nameless farce. We are puppets, fools, and I am ready to admit that everything is just a state of consciousness ‚Äì but it is still a fool's state of consciousness. Tomorrow's puppet who might ask for grace from the divine, and believe in him, will still be a puppet, a pacified and resigned puppet ‚Äì but a marionette no less absurd playing a game no less absurd. I understand those who go about planting dynamite everywhere; if they seek death, it is because they desperately wanted to live but found it impossible to live. One cannot live, one can only flee this intolerable existence in one way or another. Mother, it is impossible for a man to look at himself straight in the face in a completely lucid way for more than five minutes ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IF HE DID, HE WOULD KILL HIMSELF</span>... So I wonder if the divine ‚Äì if he exists ‚Äì has ever known the suffering of mankind. If he exists, why doesn't he give men the <em>strength</em> to break out of this ‚ÄúMagic Circle‚Äù in which they keep turning like prisoners in a cell. Twelve years ago, when I was twenty, I was turning in circles in a prison cell in Bordeaux,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="22" href="#">1</a> awaiting some execution or other ‚Äì but I am still this same prisoner. If I have advanced during these twelve years, it is in despair, in misery. All this is outrageous, scandalous, should the divine exist.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-203">All my past is weighing down on me, not because of any attachments, for I regret <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOTHING</span> of my past and my only hope is what lies before me. Yet I have not entirely undergone all this like a marionette, it even seems to me that ‚ÄúI‚Äù have created it, composed it like a book ‚Äì for the last fifteen years, from the time of the concentration camps, I have consciously multiplied my experiences and have passed through a whole range of rebellions and situations in order to gather the basic material for a book. As it happens, this formulation of ‚Äúmy‚Äù book gradually merged with the search for my real Self. Now I know what I was seeking, but this book has grown with me, it is there like a powerful formation weighing down on me, and it weighs on me all the more now, for since my contact with Sri Aurobindo all my past experiences seem charged with meaning and symbolism. I find your hand in it everywhere, and I can now connect all the apparent coincidences and sift out an extraordinary necessity that has led me here; all this makes a dense, living, vibrant book that weighs on me. I need to cast it all out, to free myself, to write this book.</p>

<p class="PE"> commitment, it will help me set my route in a decisive way. It is a test.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-205">There is another consideration as well ‚Äì though if I am deluding myself, please enlighten me. I feel that if this book is successful, it could be useful to others and serve Sri Aurobindo's work. For I have had the opportunity to live concretely, the hard way, many of the questions that others ask themselves. Thus all my past experiences appear to be a living demonstration of a teaching to which Sri Aurobindo is the key. What has already been said abstractly or philosophically, I can say in the form of a living and moving novel. I think that I feel in me the power to express these things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-206">Sweet Mother, perhaps I am deceiving myself, but I am writing you explicitly so that you may enlighten me. I am not telling you all these things for you to approve of my need to write, but for you to tell me what is <em>your will</em>. I do not want to be ‚Äúa writer,‚Äù but your child, your instrument. Only, there is something in me that has to be liquidated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-207">The problem poses itself <em>practically</em>, for I would need a rather long period of uninterrupted work to be rid of all this. Yet I have carried this book in me for so long that it is ready in every detail ‚Äì I could finish it in six months. Here, I am too occupied with other things to finish it quickly. Furthermore, I feel the need to redefine my presence here from an outside perspective. I thought of going to Brewster's lodge in the Himalayas. There, I could continue some of the work I have been doing with Pavitra. It seems to me that I would come back freed and refortified in my purpose for being here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-208">Sweet Mother, am I deluding myself? What is your will? It is your will that I want, not my desire, and I am sure you will give me the strength to follow your directives, <em>whatever they be</em>. Enlighten me.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-211">Sweet Mother, here is what has been happening in me almost every evening: I am literally like a bundle of compressed force that somehow can neither explode nor settle down and dissolve. The heaviness in my chest is such that I breathe with difficulty, as though all the blood in my body were converging there, oppressing me. In my head, the pressure at times is so intense that I dare not even close my eyes or concentrate further, for I feel it could crack. My entire being is so tense and filled with force that it seems it could break <em>physically</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-212">Is this perhaps a dangerous state? Or else is it normal? I would like to know whether this feeling that it could physically crack is a good sign or a bad one. If it is a bad sign, what can be done?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-213">There is certainly some resistance in me, something that fundamentally says ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù and I am mentally trying to remain calm, unrebellious, but deep down it resists. I am not at all in search of ‚Äúpowers,‚Äù but is this negative condition enough to avert accidents? Could you enlighten me? What can I do against this deep-rooted resistance?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-226">Sweet Mother, for many long months I have been struggling with myself in a painful conflict, and at times I have even felt certain dangers. Finally, I went within myself, into the calm, and it seemed to me that I would do well to go away for a while.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-227">I had thought I could free myself from this conflict by writing a book. But in fact, it is not the mind that needs to be freed, or at least not only that, it is the vital that needs to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WEAR ITSELF OUT</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-228">I believe I have a clear mental perception of the goal to be attained, and I no longer doubt the spiritual meaning of my life, but this kind of mental maturity is coming into conflict with a vital that is too ‚Äúyoung‚Äù and has not yet worn itself out enough on the open road. Here, this vital force has become even more concentrated and is unable to free itself. It is undoubtedly a question of time, of aging. Thus all my energy, especially during the past year, has been spent ‚Äúnegatively,‚Äù as it were ‚Äì in an effort not to leave. This struggle seems to have eliminated all positive effort, even the very meaning of my presence here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-229">This vital force is no longer seeking a sexual fulfillment nor success in a world it no longer believes in, but it needs to ‚Äúmove,‚Äù to come out. Perhaps things would be better if I went to breathe a bit in the Himalayas? I don't want to do anything without your accord, and were I to leave, it would be after the 15th of August.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-230">Sweet Mother, I am writing you all this calmly, without rebellion; but during these past months, the acuteness of the conflict has become so great that at times I feel myself in danger. I am putting all this before you so that you may tell me what is right.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-232">Mother, two months ago I had a clear mental perception of what was asked of me: to spend the rest of my life here. This is the source of my difficulties and of the inner hell I have been living through ever since. Each time I try to emerge, there is this image that rises up in me: your-whole-life ‚Äì and this casts me into a violent conflict. When I came here, I thought of staying for two or three years; for me the Ashram was a means of realization, not an end.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-233">I understand now that as long as my whole being has not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ACCEPTED</span> that it must finish its life here, there is no way out nor any ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù possible. Through my mental force alone, this acceptance is impossible; I have been turning infernally in circles these past two months, and the mind is in league with the vital. Therefore, a force greater than mine must help me accept that my way is here. I need you, Mother, for without you I am lost. I need you to tell me that the Truth of my being is indeed here and that I am truly ready to follow this path. Mother, I beseech you, help me to see the truth of my being, give me some sign that my way is here and not elsewhere. I beg of you, Mother, help me to know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-234">I also had a very clear sensation that you were abandoning me, that you had no further interest in me and I could just as well do as I pleased. Perhaps you cannot forgive some of my inner rebellions which have been so very violent? Am I totally <em>guilty? Is</em> it true that you are abandoning me?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-235">I am broken and battered in the depths of my being as I was in my flesh in the concentration camps. Will the divine grace take pity on me?

I felt luminously that without you I would never have been able to go forward a single step and that, basically, all my efforts have served only to teach me the futility of my efforts, as it were, and to lead me to this point of helplessness where I must totally surrender myself into the hands of a greater Force ‚Äì into your hands. And I felt so absolutely that you would do <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> for me if only I relied upon you totally.

And this dual movement of receiving and offering seemed to grow within me, as though it were the very movement of the world, the breathing of the world that receives and gives itself. And I perceived that, at a certain moment, this rhythm could stop, the circle close again, the two breaths join in a luminous immobility. Then vaguely, I discerned ‚Äì as though from far away, behind a veil ‚Äì a kind of pure, brilliant white light, and saw that it was you at the heart of the world. And then I felt how marvelous it was to be able to give myself. I seemed to have grasped the secret of duality, for the joy of offering, for the joy of love. Then I felt that I was beginning to mentalize things. In a way, I was afraid of recording too well what was happening, and I held myself out to you in silence and in love, for it seemed to me that the experience could be an obstacle, a stopping place, whereas one must always go farther. Then it seemed that you were there ‚Äì I did not see you exactly, but I felt, I felt that you were smiling at me as from behind a veil. The distribution ended all too soon, and then I had a class.

<p class="PE"> Oh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-290">And why should they benefit from it? What entitles them to benefit from it? Simply because they took the train to come here?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-291">I knew some people who came here a long time ago, something like (Oh, I don't recall anymore, but quite a long time ago!), certainly more than twenty years ago; the first time someone died in the Ashram, they expressed a considerable dissatisfaction: ‚ÄúBut I came here because I thought this yoga would make me immortal! If you can still die, then why did I come here?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-292">Well, it's the same thing.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-294">I would repeat the same thing. What reason and what right have they to ask that things be easier? What have they done on their side? Why should it be easier? To satisfy people's laziness and sloth ‚Äì or what?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-295"><em>Because when something new comes, we always have the idea of benefiting from it.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-296">No! Not only in the case of something new: in every case, there is always this idea of benefiting. However, that is the best way to get nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-297">Who are you trying to fool? The Divine?... That is hardly possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-298">It's the same with those who ask for an interview. I 
tell them, ‚ÄúLook, you have come in large numbers, and if each one asks me for an

<p class="PE"> Look. If all of you who have heard of this, not once but perhaps hundreds of times, who have spoken of it yourselves, thought about it, hoped for it, wanted it (there are some people who have come here only for this, to receive the Supramental Force and to be transformed into supermen, this has been their goal...) then how is it that you were <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL</span> such strangers to this Force that when it came, you did not even feel it?!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-311">Can you solve that problem for me? If you find the solution to this problem, you will have the solution to the difficulty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-312">I am not speaking of people from outside who have never thought about it, who have never felt concerned and who do not even know that there may be something like the Supermind to receive, in fact. I am speaking of people who have built their lives upon this aspiration (and I don't doubt their sincerity for a minute), who have worked ‚Äì some of them for thirty years, some for thirty-five, others somewhat less ‚Äì all the while saying, ‚ÄúWhen the supermind comes... When the supermind comes...‚Äù That was their refrain: ‚ÄúWhen the supermind comes...‚Äù Consequently, they were really in the best possible frame of mind, one could not have dreamt of a better predisposition. How is it, then, that their inner preparation was so... let's just say ‚Äúincomplete,‚Äù that they did not feel the Vibration immediately, as soon as it came, through a shock of identity?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-313">Individually, each one's goal was to make himself ready, to enter into a more or less intimate individual relationship with this Force, so as to help the process; or else, if he could not help, at least be ready to recognize and be open to the Force when it would manifest. Then instead of being an alien element in a world in which your <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OWN</span> inner capacity remains unmanifest, you suddenly become <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>, you enter directly, fully, into the very atmosphere: the Force is there, all around you, permeating you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-314">If you had had a little inner contact, you would have recognized it immediately, don't you think so?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-315">Well, in any event, that was the case for those who had a little inner contact; they recognized it, they felt it, and they said, ‚ÄúAh, there it is! It has come!‚Äù But how is it that so many hundreds of people ‚Äì not to mention the handful of those who really wanted only that, thought only of that, had staked their whole lives on that ‚Äì how is it that they felt nothing? What can this mean?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-316">It is well known that only like knows like. It is an obvious fact.</p>

<p class="PE"> Thing individually ‚Äì this was even what Sri Aurobindo had described as being the necessary procedure: a certain number of people would enter into contact with this Force through their inner effort and their aspiration. We had called it the ascent towards the Supermind. And <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IF</span> and when they had touched the Supermind through an inner ascent (that is, by freeing themselves from the material consciousness), they should have recognized it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SPONTANEOUSLY</span> as soon as it came. But a preliminary contact was indispensable ‚Äì if you have never touched it, how can you recognize it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-318">That's how the universal movement works (I read this to you a few days ago): through their inner effort and inner progress, certain individuals, who are the pioneers, the forerunners, enter into communication with the new Force which is to manifest, and they receive it in themselves. And because a number of calls like this surge forth, the thing becomes possible, and the era, the time, the moment for the manifestation comes. This is how it happened ‚Äì and the Manifestation took place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-319">But then, all those who were ready should have recognized it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-320">I hasten to tell you that some did recognize it, but they were so few... But as for those who ask these questions, who even took the trouble to come here, who took the train to gulp this down as you gulp down a soft drink, how can they possibly feel anything whatsoever if they have not prepared themselves at all? Yet they are already speaking of profiting: ‚ÄúWe want to benefit from it...‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-321">After all, if they have even a tiny bit of sincerity (not too much, it's tiring!), a tiny bit of sincerity, it is quite possible (I am joking), it is quite possible that they might get a few good kicks to make them go faster! It is possible. In fact, I think that's what will happen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-322">But really, this attitude... this rather overly commercial attitude, is usually not very profitable. If you have difficulties and you sincerely aspire, it is likely that the difficulties will diminish. Let us hope so.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-330">You may call it whatever you like, it makes no difference to me, but we must understand each other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-331">What I call a ‚Äúdescent‚Äù takes place in the individual consciousness. In the same way, we speak of ‚Äúascent‚Äù (there is no ascent really, there is no high or low, no direction: it's all a manner of speaking) ‚Äì we speak of ‚Äúascent‚Äù when we feel ourselves rising up towards something, and we call it a ‚Äúdescent‚Äù when, after having caught this thing, we bring it down into ourselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-332">But when the doors are opened and the flood pours in, it can no longer be called a ‚Äúdescent‚Äù: it is a Force that spreads everywhere. Understood?... Ah!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-333">I don't care what words you use. I do not essentially insist upon my words, but I explain them to you, and it's better to agree on words beforehand, for otherwise there's no end to explanations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-334">But now, you may reply to those people who are asking these insidious questions that the best way to receive anything whatsoever is not to pull, but to give. If they want to give themselves to the new life, well, the new life will enter into them.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-399">Sweet Mother, my birthday is the day after tomorrow, the 30th. I come to place my inner situation before you so that you may help me take a decision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-400">I am facing the same difficulties as before my departure to Hyderabad, and I have made the same mistakes. The main reason for this state is that, on the one hand, words and ideas seem to have lost all power over me, and on the other, the vital √©lan which led me thus far is dead. So upon what shall my faith rest? I still have some faith, of course, but it has become totally <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ABSTRACT</span>. The vital does not cooperate, so I feel all withered, suspended in a void, nothing seems to give me direction anymore. There is no rebelliousness in me, but rather a void.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-401">In this state, I am ceaselessly thinking of my forest in Guiana or of my travels through Africa and the ardor that filled me with life in those days. I seem to need to have my goal before me and to walk towards it. Outer difficulties also seem to help me resolve my inner problems: there is a kind of need in me for the ‚Äúelements‚Äù ‚Äì the sea, the forest, the desert ‚Äì for a milieu with which I can wrestle and through which I can grow. Here, I seem to lack a dynamic point of leverage. Here, in the everyday routine, everything seems to be falling apart in me. Should I not return to my forest in Guiana?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-402">Mother, I implore you, in the name of whatever led me to you in the first place, give me the strength to do <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WHAT HAS TO BE DONE</span>.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-444"><em>When a serious decision has to be made, how can one know in which direction lies one's true destiny?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-445">We do not have one destiny, but several destinies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-446">Each one has the right to reunite with his supreme Origin, whatever his place in the world order ‚Äì that is the gift the Divine has given to matter, and this is your true destiny. And it is a special gift given to the earth; it does not exist in the other worlds. At the same time, each one has a particular role in the manifestation, which is determined by the Supreme, but this same role can exist on different levels depending upon the degree of evolution of ‚Äúthat‚Äù which is within you. If ‚Äúthat‚Äù within you is still very young, your realization may be absolute and you may effectively be able to reunite with the Supreme, but the field of realization in the world will be limited, very small. Along the vertical plane, you may be able to touch the Supreme directly, in spite of your smallness, but on the horizontal plane, the extent of your realization will be infinitesimal. We could take the example</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page103">Page 103</p>
<p class="PE"> of Maheshwari, the Mother of Might and All-Wisdom. This aspect of the Mother will assume different forms depending upon the degree of evolution of ‚Äúthat‚Äù within you: it might be a mere little group leader, a queen, an empress. She will be in the group leader as well as in the empress, but the field of realization will obviously be different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-447">So, along this same vertical line that leads you to your divine Origin, you might have several outer destinies depending upon your state of development. The yoga seeks to accelerate things, but this is not always possible, for some psychological combinations in the being can only be worked out through experience. This experience may take a few lifetimes, a few years, a few months, a few minutes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-448">When seen from the supreme consciousness, the unfolding of all the destinies and all the possibilities of destiny is something infinitely interesting. For example, there are beings accused of megalomania because they have vast projects and great designs which do not always fit in with the world's present possibilities. Most often, it is a simple lack of judgment on their part, a lack of knowledge. They have indeed entered into communication with a higher truth, something that probably corresponds to a future phase of their destiny (which is why they are so convinced), but through lack of judgment, they do not see that the time for this truth has not yet come, that the circumstances are not yet ready, or that the conditions in which they were born prevent them from carrying out what they feel to be true. There is a gap between the vision of a truth and its present possibilities for realization. But these great dreams must not be killed, for it would mean killing something of your own future. Above all, we must refuse, energetically reject, this hideous morality of the Philistine which says that ‚Äúnothing ever changes,‚Äù this flat and vulgar common sense <em>√† la</em> Sancho Panza. Simply, one must know how to wait and to nurture one's dreams for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-449">To conclude, this is what may be said: in the universe, there are no two destinies alike ‚Äì there cannot be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-450">Each one's destiny is inevitably fulfilled, but the nearer one is to the Divine, the more this destiny assumes its divine qualities.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Extract from the Wednesday class)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-453">I have been asked if we are doing a collective yoga and what are the conditions of a collective yoga.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-454">First, I could tell you that to do a collective yoga, there has to be a collectivity!... And I could speak to you about the different conditions required to be a collectivity. But last night <span class="note_1"><em>(smiling)</em></span>, 
I had a symbolic vision of our collectivity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-455">This vision took place early in the night and woke me up with a rather unpleasant feeling. Then I fell back to sleep and forgot about it; but a little while ago, when I was thinking of the question put to me, it returned. It returned with a great intensity and so imperatively that now, just as I wanted to tell you what kind of collectivity we wish to realize according to the ideal described by Sri Aurobindo in the last chapter of <em>The Life Divine ‚Äì a</em> gnostic, supramental collectivity, the only kind that can do Sri Aurobindo's integral yoga and be realized physically in a progressive collective body becoming more and more divine ‚Äì the recollection of this vision became so imperative that I couldn't speak.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-456">Its symbolism was very clear, though of quite a familiar nature,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page105">Page 105</p>
<p class="PE"> as it were, and because of its very familiarity, unmistakable in its realism... Were I to tell you all the details, you would probably not even be able to follow: it was rather intricate. It was a kind of (how can I express it?) ‚Äì an immense hotel where all the terrestrial possibilities were lodged in different apartments. And it was all in a constant state of transformation: parts or entire wings of the building were suddenly torn down and rebuilt while people were still living in them, such that if you went off somewhere within the immense hotel itself, you ran the risk of no longer finding your room when you wanted to return to it, for it might have been torn down and was being rebuilt according to another plan! It was orderly, it was organized... yet there was this fantastic chaos which I mentioned. And all this was a symbol ‚Äì a symbol that certainly applies to what Sri Aurobindo has written here<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="36" href="#">1</a> regarding the necessity for the transformation of the body, the type of transformation that has to take place for life to become a divine life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-457">It went something like this: somewhere, in the center of this enormous edifice, there was a room reserved ‚Äì as it seemed in the story ‚Äì for a mother and her daughter. The mother was a lady, an elderly lady, a very influential matron who had a great deal of authority and her own views concerning the entire organization. Her daughter seemed to have a power of movement and activity enabling her to be everywhere at once while at the same time remaining in her room, which was... well, a bit more than a room ‚Äì it was a kind of apartment which, above all, had the characteristic of being very central. But she was constantly arguing with her mother. The mother wanted to keep things ‚Äújust as they were,‚Äù with their usual rhythm, which precisely meant the habit of tearing down one thing to rebuild another, then again tearing down that to build still another, thus giving the building an appearance of frightful confusion. But the daughter did not like this, and she had another plan. Most of all, she wanted to bring something completely new into the organization: a kind of super-organization that would render all this confusion unnecessary. Finally, as it was impossible for them to reach an understanding, the daughter left the room to go on a kind of general inspection... She went out, looked everything over, and then wanted to return to her room to decide upon some final measures. But this is where something rather... peculiar began happening.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page106">Page 106</p>
<p class="PE"> She clearly remembered where her room was, but each time she set out to go there, either the staircase disappeared or things were so changed that she could no longer find her way! So she went here and there, up and down, searched, went in and out... but it was impossible to find the way to her room! Since all of this assumed a physical appearance ‚Äì as I said, a very familiar and very common appearance, as is always the case in these symbolic visions ‚Äì there was somewhere (how shall I put it?) the hotel's administrative office and a woman who seemed to be the manager, who had all the keys and who knew where everyone was staying. So the daughter went to this person and asked her, ‚ÄúCould you show me the way to my room?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúBut of course! Easily!‚Äù Everyone around the manager looked at her as if to say, ‚ÄúHow can you say that?‚Äù However, she got up, and with authority asked for a key ‚Äì the key to the daughter's room ‚Äì saying, ‚ÄúI shall take you there.‚Äù And off she went along all kinds of paths, but all so complicated, so bizarre! The daughter was following along behind her very attentively, you see, so as not to lose sight of her. But just as they should have come to the place where the daughter's room was supposed to be, suddenly the manageress (let us call her the manageress), both the manageress and her key... vanished! And the sense of this vanishing was so acute that... at the same time, everything vanished!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-458">So... to help you understand this enigma, let me tell you that the mother is physical Nature as she is, and the daughter is the new creation. The manageress is the world's organizing mental consciousness as Nature has developed it thus far, that is, the most advanced organizing sense to have manifested in the present state of material Nature. This is the key to the vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-459">Naturally, when I awoke, I immediately knew what could resolve this problem which appeared so absolutely insoluble. The vanishing of the manageress and her key was an obvious sign that she was altogether incapable of leading what could be called ‚Äúthe creative consciousness of the new world‚Äù to its true place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-460">I knew this, but I did not have a vision of the solution, which means it has yet to manifest; this ‚Äúthing‚Äù had not yet manifested in the building, this fantastic construction, although it is the very mode of consciousness which could transform this incoherent creation into something real, truly conceived, willed and materialized, with a center in its proper place, a recognized place, and with a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">REAL</span> effective power.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page107">Page 107</p>
<p class="PE"> The symbolism is quite clear in that all the possibilities are there, all the activities are there, but in disorder and confusion. They are neither coordinated nor centralized nor unified around the central and unique truth and consciousness and will. So this brings us back... precisely to this question of a collective yoga and of a collectivity capable of realizing it. What should this collectivity be?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-461">It is certainly not an arbitrary construction of the type built by men, where everything is put pell-mell, without any order, without reality, and which is held together by only illusory ties. Here, these ties were symbolized by the hotel's walls, while actually in ordinary human constructions (if we take a religious community, for example), they are symbolized by the building of a monastery, an identity of clothing, an identity of activities, an identity even of movement ‚Äì or to put it more precisely: everyone wears the same uniform, everyone gets up at the same time, everyone eats the same thing, everyone says his prayers together, etc.; there is an overall identity. But naturally, on the inside there remains the chaos of many disparate consciousnesses, each one following its own mode, for this kind of group identification, which extends right up to an identity of beliefs and dogma, is absolutely illusory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-462">Yet it is one of the most common types of human collectivity ‚Äì to group together, band together, unite around a common ideal, a common action, a common realization but in an absolutely artificial way. In contrast to this, Sri Aurobindo tells us that a true community ‚Äì what he terms a gnostic or supramental community ‚Äì can be based only upon the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INNER REALIZATION</span> of each one of its members, each realizing his real, concrete oneness and identity with all the other members of the community; that is, each one should not feel himself a member connected to all the others in an arbitrary way, but that all are one within himself. For each one, the others should be as much himself as his own body ‚Äì not in a mental and artificial way, but through a fact of consciousness, by an inner realization.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-463">This means that before hoping to realize such a gnostic collectivity, each one must first of all become (or at least start to become) a gnostic being. It is obvious that the individual work must take the lead and the collective work follow; but the fact remains that spontaneously, without any arbitrary intervention of</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page108">Page 108</p>
<p class="PE"> will, the individual progress 
is restrained or <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CHECKED</span>, as it were, by the collective state. Between the collectivity and the individual, there exists an interdependence from which one cannot be totally free, even if one tries. And even he who might try, in his yoga, to free himself totally from the human and terrestrial state of consciousness, would be at least subconsciously bound by the state of the whole, which impedes and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PULLS BACKWARDS</span>. One can attempt to go much faster, one can attempt to let all the weight of attachments and responsibilities fall off, but in spite of everything, the realization of even the most advanced or the leader in the march of evolution is dependent upon the realization of the whole, dependent upon the state in which the terrestrial collectivity happens to be. And this <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PULLS</span> backwards to such an extent that sometimes one has to wait centuries for the earth to be ready before being able to realize what is to be realized.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-464">This is why Sri Aurobindo has also written somewhere else that a double movement is necessary: the effort for individual progress and realization must be combined with the effort of trying to uplift the whole so as to enable it to make a progress indispensable for the greater progress of the individual: a mass progress, if you will, that allows the individual to take a further step forward.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-465">And now you understand why I had thought it would be useful to have a few meditations in common, to work at creating a common atmosphere a bit more organized than... my big hotel of last night!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-466">So, the best way to use these meditations (and they are going to increase, since we are now also going to replace the ‚Äúdistributions‚Äù with short meditations) is to go deep within yourselves, as far as you can, and find the place where you can feel, perceive and perhaps even create an atmosphere of oneness wherein a force of order and organization can put each element in its true place, and out of the chaos existing at this hour, make a new, harmonious world surge forth.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(On freedom)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-488">There are all kinds of freedom ‚Äì mental freedom, vital freedom, spiritual freedom ‚Äì which are the fruits of successive masteries. But a completely new freedom has become possible with the Supramental Manifestation: it is the freedom of the body.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page112">Page 112</p>
<p class="PE"> One of the very first results of the supramental manifestation was to give the body a freedom and an autonomy it has never before known. And when I say freedom, I don't mean some psychological perception or an inner state of consciousness, but something else and far better ‚Äì it is a new phenomenon in the body, in the cells of the body. For the first time, the cells themselves have felt that they are free, that they have the power to decide. When the new vibrations came and combined with the old ones, I felt it at once and it showed me that a new world was really taking birth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-489">In its normal state, the body always feels that it is not its own master: illnesses invade it without its really being able to resist them ‚Äì a thousand factors impose themselves or exert pressure upon it. Its sole power is the power to defend itself, to react. Once the illness has got in, it can fight and overcome it ‚Äì even modern medicine has acknowledged that the body is cured only when it decides to get cured; it is not the drugs <em>per se</em> that heal, for if the ailment is temporarily suppressed by a drug without the body's will, it grows up again elsewhere in some other form until the body itself has decided to be cured. But this implies only a defensive power, the power to react against an invading enemy ‚Äì it is not true freedom.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-490">But with the supramental manifestation, something new has taken place in the body: it feels it is its own master, autonomous, with its two feet solidly on the ground, as it were. This gives a physical impression of the whole being suddenly drawing itself up, with its head lifted high ‚Äì I am my own master.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-491">We live perennially with a burden on our shoulders, something that bows our heads down, and we feel pulled, led by all kinds of external forces, we don't know by whom or what, nor where to ‚Äì this is what men call Fate, Destiny. When you do yoga, one of the first experiences ‚Äì the experience of the <em>kundalini</em>, as it is called here in India ‚Äì is precisely one in which the consciousness rises, breaks through this hard ‚Äúlid,‚Äù here, at the crown of the head, and at last you emerge into the Light. Then you see, you know, you decide and you realize ‚Äì difficulties may still remain, but truly speaking one is above them. Well, as a result of the supramental manifestation, it is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span> experience that came into the body. The body straightened its head up and felt its freedom, its independence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-492">During the flu epidemic, for example, I spent every day in the midst of people who were germ carriers. And one day, I clearly</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page113">Page 113</p>
<p class="PE"> felt that the body had decided not to catch this flu. It asserted its autonomy. You see, it was not a question of the higher Will deciding, no. It didn't take place in the highest consciousness: the body itself decided. When you are way above in your consciousness, you see things, you know things; but in actual fact, once you descend again into matter, it is like water running through sand. In this respect, things have changed, the body has a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DIRECT</span> power, independent of any outer intervention. Even though it is barely visible, I consider this to be a very important result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-493">And this new vibration in the body has allowed me to understand the mechanism of the transformation. It is not something that comes from a higher Will, not a higher consciousness that imposes itself upon the body: it is the body itself awakening in its cells, a freedom of the cells themselves, an absolutely new vibration that sets disorders right ‚Äì even disorders that existed prior to the supramental manifestation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-494">Naturally, all this is a gradual process, but I am hopeful that little by little this new consciousness will grow, gain ground and victoriously resist the old forces of destruction and annihilation, and this Fatality we believed to be so inexorable.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-499">The integral yoga is made up of an uninterrupted series of tests that you must pass through without any advance notice, thereby forcing you to be always vigilant and attentive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-500">Three groups of examiners conduct these tests. Apparently they have nothing in common and their methods are so different, at times even so seemingly contradictory, that they do not appear to work towards the same goal, and yet they complete one another, they work together for a common aim and each is indispensable for the integral result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-501">These three categories of tests are: those conducted by the forces of Nature, those conducted by the spiritual and divine forces, and those conducted by the hostile forces. This latter category is the most deceptive in its appearance, and a constant state of vigilance, sincerity and humility is required so as not to be caught by surprise or unprepared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-502">The most commonplace circumstances, people, the everyday events of life, the most seemingly insignificant things, all belong to one or another of these three categories of examiners. In this considerably complex organization of tests, those events generally considered the most important in life are really the easiest of all examinations to pass, for they find you prepared and on your guard. One stumbles more easily over the little pebbles on the path, for they attract no attention.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page115">Page 115</p>
<p class="PE"> The qualities more particularly required for the tests of physical Nature are endurance and plasticity, cheerfulness and fearlessness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-503">For the spiritual tests: aspiration, confidence, idealism, enthusiasm and generosity in self-giving.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-504">For the tests stemming from the hostile forces: vigilance, sincerity and humility.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-505">But do not imagine that those who are tested are on one side and those who test on the other; depending upon the times and circumstances, we are both examiners and examined, and it may even happen that simultaneously, at the very same moment, we are the examined and the examiner. And whatever benefits we derive depend, in both quality and quantity, upon the intensity of our aspiration and the alertness of our consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-506">To conclude, a final recommendation: never pose as an examiner. For while it is good to remember constantly that perhaps one is passing a very important test, it is, on the other hand, extremely dangerous to imagine oneself entrusted with applying tests to others, for that is an open door to the most absurd and harmful vanities. It is not an ignorant human will that decides these things but the Supreme Wisdom.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-512"><em>It is said that Sri Aurobindo and you are one and the same consciousness, but are the personal presence of Sri Aurobindo and your own personal presence two distinct things, each playing a particular role?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-513">I am with you because I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AM</span> you or you are me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-514">‚ÄúI am with you‚Äù means a world of things, for I am with you at every level, on every plane, from the supreme consciousness to my most physical consciousness. Here, in Pondicherry, you cannot breathe without breathing my consciousness. It permeates the atmosphere in the subtle physical almost materially and extends right to the lake, seven miles away from here. Beyond, my consciousness can be felt in the material vital, and then on the mental and the other higher planes everywhere. When I came here for the first time, I felt Sri Aurobindo's atmosphere, felt it materially, ten miles from the shore ‚Äì ten nautical miles, not kilometers! It was very sudden, very concrete, a pure and luminous atmosphere, light, so light that it lifts you up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-515">A long time ago, Sri Aurobindo had this reminder, with which you are all quite familiar, put up everywhere in the Ashram: ‚ÄúAlways behave as if the Mother was looking at you; because she is, indeed, always present.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-516">This is not some mere sentence, these are not just words, it is a fact. I am very concretely with you, and those with a subtle vision can see me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-517">Generally speaking, my Force is constantly here at work, constantly changing the psychological elements of your being to put them into new relationships and to make clear to you the diverse</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page117">Page 117</p>
<p class="PE"> facets of your nature so that you may see what must be changed, developed or eliminated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-518">But besides all this, there is a special personal bond of affection between you and me, between all who have turned towards Sri Aurobindo's teaching and me ‚Äì and of course, distance does not count; you may be in France, at the other end of the world, or in Pondicherry, but this bond remains just as real and as living. Each time there is a call, each time I need to know something to send out a force, an inspiration, a protection or whatever else, a sort of message suddenly comes to me, and I do what is needed. Obviously, these communications come to me at any moment whatsoever, and you may have seen me more than once suddenly stop in the middle of a sentence or some work: it means something, some communication is coming, so I concentrate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-519">There is more than a bond with those whom I have accepted as disciples, those to whom I have said ‚Äúyes‚Äù ‚Äì there is an emanation of myself. Whenever necessary, this emanation notifies me as to what is happening. In fact, I know constantly, but all these things are not registered in my active memory, otherwise I would be flooded ‚Äì the physical consciousness acts as a filter: things are recorded on a subtle plane and remain there in the latent state, rather like music that is silently recorded, and when I need to know something with my physical consciousness, I plug into this subtle plane and the tape starts playing. Then I can see things, their evolution and the present result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-520">And if, for some reason or other, you write asking for my help, and I answer, ‚ÄúI am with you,‚Äù this means that the communication with you becomes active, that you are even in my active consciousness for some time ‚Äì the time needed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-521">And this bond between you and me is never cut. There are people who left the Ashram a long time ago, in a state of revolt, and yet I continue to know them and to take care of them. You are never abandoned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-522">In truth, I feel responsible for everyone, even for people I have met for only one second in my life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-523">Now, you know that Sri Aurobindo and I are always one and the same consciousness, one and the same person. Only, when this unique force or presence is felt in your individual consciousness, it assumes different forms or appearances depending upon your temperament, your aspirations, your needs, the particular cast of your nature. Your individual consciousness is</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page118">Page 118</p>
<p class="PE"> like a filter, a pointer, as it were; it makes a choice and settles upon one possibility in the infinity of divine possibilities. In truth, the Divine gives to each one exactly what he expects from Him. If you believe the Divine to be distant and cruel, He will be distant and cruel, because it may be necessary for your supreme well-being to feel the wrath of God. He will be Kali<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="31" href="#">1</a> for the worshippers of Kali, and bliss for the bhakta.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="32" href="#">2</a> He will be the All-Knowledge of seekers after Knowledge, the Transcendent Impersonal of the illusionist. He will be an atheist for the atheist, and the love of the lover. He will be fraternal and near, an ever faithful friend, ever helpful, to those who feel him as the inner guide of each movement, at each minute. And if you believe that He can erase everything, He will erase all your faults, all your errors, tirelessly, and at each moment you will feel his infinite Grace. In truth, the Divine is what you expect of Him in your deep aspiration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-524">And once you enter into this consciousness where all things are seen with a single look, the infinite multitude of the Divine's relationships with men, you realize how wonderful everything is, in every detail. You can also look at the history of mankind and see how much the Divine has evolved depending upon what men have understood, desired, hoped for or dreamed; how he was materialistic with the materialist, and how each day he grows, draws nearer, becomes more luminous, as the human consciousness widens. Everyone is free to choose. The perfection of this endless variety of relationships between man and God throughout the history of the world is an unutterable wonder. Yet all this together is but a second in the total manifestation of the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-525">The Divine is with you according to your aspirations. This does not mean, naturally, that He bends to the whims of your outer nature ‚Äì I am speaking here of the truth of your being. Yet sometimes He does fashion himself according to your outer aspirations; and if, like the devout, you live alternately in estrangement and embrace, ecstasy and despair, the Divine too will be estranged from you or draw near, according to your belief. Therefore, one's attitude is extremely important, even one's outer attitude. People do not know just how important faith is, how faith is miracle ‚Äì the creator of miracles. For if at each moment, you expect to be uplifted and drawn towards the Divine, He will come</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(On past lives)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-532">If we are to speak of these things truly, we must speak of everything, in all details, for among the innumerable experiences I have had for nearly eighty years, many were of such variety and apparently so contradictory that in truth it can be said that all is possible. Therefore, to say something about past lives without retrieving the thread that runs through all the elements is to open the door to dogmatism. One day they will say, ‚ÄúMother said this, Mother said that...‚Äù and that is, alas, how dogmas are born.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-533">So given the multiplicity of experiences and the impossibility of spending my life speaking and writing, you must clearly understand that everything is possible and not be dogmatic. Nevertheless, I can give you a few general indications.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-534">It is only when one is consciously identified with his divine Origin that he can speak with complete truthfulness of a memory of past lives. Sri Aurobindo speaks of a progressive manifestation of the Spirit in the forms it inhabits. When one reaches the summit of this manifestation, one has a plunging view of the path already traversed, and one remembers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-535">But that does not mean remembering in a mental way. Those who claim to have been this or that baron in the Middle Ages or such and such a person who lived at such and such a place during such and such a time are fantasizing; they are simply victims of their own mental fancies. For what remains of past lives are not beautiful illustrated classics in which you see yourself as a great lord in a castle or a victorious general at the head of his army ‚Äì all that is fiction. What remains is the memory of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INSTANTS</span></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page121">Page 121</p>
<p class="PE"> when the psychic being emerged from the depths of your being and revealed itself to you, or in other words, the memory of those moments when you were fully conscious. The growth of the consciousness is effected progressively through evolution, and the memory of past lives is generally limited to the critical moments of this evolution, to the great, decisive turning points that have marked some progress in your consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-536">While living such minutes of your life, you do not at all care about remembering whether you were Lord so and so who lived at such and such a place during such and such a time ‚Äì it is not the memory of your civil status that remains. On the contrary, you lose sight of these petty external things, these minor perishable details, so as to be fully ablaze in this revelation of the soul or this divine contact. And when you recall these minutes of your past lives, the memory is so intense that it seems very near, still living ‚Äì much more living than most of the ordinary memories of your present life. At times, in dreams, when you enter into contact with certain planes of consciousness, you may also have memories with this same intensity, this vibrant hue, as it were, so much more intense than the colors and things of the physical world. These being the moments of true consciousness, all assumes an extraordinary radiance, everything is vibrant, everything is charged with a quality that eludes our ordinary vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-537">These minutes of contact with the soul are often those that mark a decisive turning point in one's life, a step forward, a progress in consciousness, and they frequently result from a crisis, a situation of extreme intensity, when a call surges forth from the whole being, a call so strong that the inner consciousness pierces through the unconscious layers that envelop it and is revealed fully luminous upon the surface. This very strong call of the being can also call forth the descent of a divine emanation, an individuality, a divine aspect that unites with your own individuality at a given moment to do a given work, to win a particular battle, to express this thing or that. Then, when the work is accomplished, this emanation most often withdraws. So it may be that one retains the memory of the circumstances surrounding these minutes of revelation or inspiration, one sees again a landscape, the color of a garment one was wearing, the shade of one's skin, things that were around you at that particular moment ‚Äì all this is imprinted in an indelible way, with an extraordinary intensity, for the details of ordinary life are then also revealed in their true</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page122">Page 122</p>
<p class="PE"> intensity, their true tonality. The consciousness that reveals itself in you reveals at the same time the consciousness in things. These details can sometimes help you reconstitute the period in which you lived or the deeds that were accomplished, surmise the country where you lived, but it is quite easy, too, to fantasize and mistake one's imaginings for reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-538">You should not conclude, however, that all memories of past lives refer to moments of great crisis, important missions or revelations. Sometimes these are very simple, transparent minutes when a perfect and integral harmony of the being is expressed. And these may correspond to entirely insignificant external situations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-539">But apart from the things that were around you at that minute, apart from that minute of contact with your psychic being, nothing remains. Once the privileged moment has passed, the psychic being sinks back into its inner somnolence and the whole outer life fades into a monotonous gray which leaves no trace. In fact, something of the same phenomenon occurs in the course of your present life: apart from those exceptional moments when you are at the summit of your mental, vital or even physical being, the rest of your existence seems to fade into an uninteresting, dull tonality, and it matters very little whether you have been at this place or some other or whether you have done this thing rather than another. If suddenly you try to look at your life in order to gather its essence ‚Äì to peer twenty or thirty or forty years behind you ‚Äì you will see two or three images spontaneously leap before you, and they are the true minutes of your life, but all the rest fades away. A spontaneous choice and a tremendous elimination thus take place in your consciousness. This gives you an idea of what happens in regard to past lives: a choice of a few special moments, and an immense elimination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-540">Of course, one's early lives are quite rudimentary and little remains of them, a few scattered memories. But the more you progress in consciousness and the more the psychic being consciously associates itself with the outer activities, the more abundant, coherent and precise do the memories become ‚Äì yet here too the memory that remains is that of the contact with the soul, and sometimes of the things associated with the psychic revelation ‚Äì not your civil status nor the ever-changing setting. And this explains why these so-called memories of animal lives partake of the highest fantasies; in animals, the divine spark is too deeply buried to come to the surface consciously and be associated with the</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page123">Page 123</p>
<p class="PE"> outer life. One must become a totally conscious being, in all the parts of the being, and be totally united with one's divine origin before one can truly say that one recalls his past lives.</p>

I want to be like a knight, your knight, and go off in search of a treasure that I could bring back to you. The world has lost all sense of the wonderful, all beauty of Adventure, this quest known to the knights of the Middle Ages.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-544"><em> The other day you told me that in order to know things, you plug into the subtle plane, and there it all unrolls as on a tape recorder. How does this work, exactly?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-545">There is a whole gradation of planes of consciousness, from the physical consciousness to my radiant consciousness at the very highest level, that which knows the Will of the Supreme. I keep all these planes of consciousness in front of me, working simultaneously, coordinatedly, and I am acting on each plane, gathering the information proper to each plane, so as to have the integral truth of things. Thus, when I have a decision to make in regard to one of you, I plug into you directly from that level of the supreme consciousness which sees the deep truth of your being. But at the same time, my decision is shaped, as it were, by the information given to me by the other planes of consciousness and particularly by the physical consciousness, which acts as a recorder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-546">This physical consciousness records all it sees, all your reactions, your thoughts, all the facts ‚Äì without preference, without prejudice, without personal will. Nothing escapes it. Its work is almost mechanical. Therefore I know what to tell or to ask you according to the integral truth of your being and its present possibilities. Ordinarily, in the normal man, the physical consciousness does not see things as they are, for three reasons: because of ignorance, because of preference, and because of an egoistic will. You color what you see, eliminate what displeases you. In short, you see only what you desire to see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-547">Now, I recently had a very striking experience: a discrepancy occurred between my physical consciousness and the consciousness of the world. In some instances decisions made in the Light and the Truth produced unexpected results, upheavals in the consciousness of others that were neither foreseen nor desired, and I did not understand. No matter how hard I tried, I could not understand ‚Äì and I emphasize this word ‚Äúunderstand.‚Äù At last, I had to leave my highest consciousness and pull myself down into the physical consciousness to find out what was happening. And there, in my head, I saw what appeared to be a little cell bursting, and suddenly I understood: the recording had been defective. The physical consciousness had neglected to register</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page125">Page 125</p>
<p class="PE"> certain of your lower reactions. It could not have been through preference or through personal will (these things were eliminated from my consciousness long, long ago). But I saw that this most material consciousness was already completely permeated with the transforming supramental truth, and it could no longer follow the rhythm of normal life. It was much more attuned to the true consciousness than to the world! I couldn't possibly blame it for lagging behind; on the contrary, it was in front, too far ahead! There was a discrepancy between the rhythm of the transformation of my being and the world's own rhythm. The supramental action on the world is slow, it does not act directly ‚Äì it acts by infiltration, by traversing the successive layers, and the results are slow to come about. So I had to pull myself violently down in order to wait for the others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-548">One must at times know how not to know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-549">This experience showed me once more the necessity to be perfectly humble before the Lord. It is not enough merely to rise to the heights, to the ethereal planes of consciousness: these planes have also to descend into matter and illuminate it. Otherwise, nothing is really done. One must have the patience to establish the communication between the high and the low. I am like a tempest, a hurricane ‚Äì if I listened to myself, I would tear into the future, and everything would go flying! But then, there would no longer be any communication with the rest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-550">One must have the patience to wait.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-551">Humility, a perfect humility, is the condition for all realization. The mind is so cocksure. It thinks it knows everything, understands everything. And if ever it acts through idealism to serve a cause that appears noble to it, it becomes even more arrogant, more intransigent, and it is almost impossible to make it see that there might be something still higher beyond its noble conceptions and its great altruistic or other ideals. Humility is the only remedy. I am not speaking of humility as conceived by certain religions, with this God that belittles his creatures and only likes to see them down on their knees. When I was a child, this kind of humility revolted me, and I refused to believe in a God that wants to belittle his creatures. I don't mean that kind of humility, but rather the recognition that one does not know, that one knows nothing, and that there may be something beyond what presently appears to us as the truest, the most noble or disinterested. True humility consists in constantly referring oneself to the Lord, in placing all before Him. When I receive a blow (and there are quite</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page126">Page 126</p>
<p class="PE"> a few of them in my sadhana), my immediate, spontaneous reaction, like a spring, is to throw myself before Him and to say, ‚ÄúThou, Lord.‚Äù Without this humility, I would never have been able to realize anything. And I say ‚ÄúI‚Äù only to make myself understood, but in fact ‚ÄúI‚Äù means the Lord through this body, his instrument. When you begin living <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span> kind of humility, it means you are drawing nearer to the realization. It is the condition, the starting point.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Extract from the Wednesday class)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-557" style="width: 80%;	margin: 0 auto;">O Nature, Material Mother,<br/>
	thou hast said that thou wilt collaborate<br/>
	and there is no limit<br/>
	to the splendour of this collaboration.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(Message of January 1, 1958)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-558"><em>Sweet Mother, will you explain this year's message?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-559">There is nothing to explain. It is an experience, something that took place, and when it took place, I noted it down; and it so happens that it occurred just as I remembered that I had to write something for the new year (which at that time was the following year, that is, the year beginning today). When I remembered that I had to write something ‚Äì not because of that, but simultaneously ‚Äì this experience came, and when I noted it down, I realized that it was... the message for this year!</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(Mother reads the notation of her experience)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-560">During one of our classes <em>(October 30, 1957)</em>, I spoke of the limitless abundance of Nature, this tireless Creatrice who takes the multitude of forms, mixes them together, separates them again and reforms them, again undoes them, again destroys them, in order to move on to ever new combinations. As I said, it is a huge cauldron. Things get churned up in it and somehow something emerges; if it's defective, it is thrown back in and something else is taken out... One form, two forms or a hundred forms make no difference to her, there are thousands upon thousands of forms ‚Äì and one year, a hundred years, a thousand years, millions of years, what difference does it make? Eternity lies before her! She quite obviously enjoys herself and is in no hurry. If you speak to her of pressing on or of rushing through</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page132">Page 132</p>
<p class="PE"> some part of her work or other, her reply is always the same: ‚ÄúBut what for? Why? Aren't you enjoying it?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-561">The evening I told you these things, I totally identified myself with Nature and I entered into her play. And this movement of identification brought forth a response, a new kind of intimacy between Nature and myself, a long movement of drawing ever nearer which culminated in an experience that came on November 8.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-562">Nature suddenly understood. She understood that this newborn Consciousness does not seek to reject her, but wants to embrace her entirely. She understood that this new spirituality does not stand apart from life, does not timorously recoil before the awesome richness of her movement, but on the contrary wants to integrate all her facets. She understood that the supramental consciousness is not there to diminish her but to make her complete.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-563">Then, from the supreme Reality came this command: ‚ÄúAwaken, O Nature, to the joy of collaboration.‚Äù And suddenly, all Nature rushed forth in an immense bounding of joy, saying, ‚ÄúI accept! I will collaborate!‚Äù And at the same time, there came a calm, an absolute tranquillity, to allow this receptacle, this body, to receive and contain without breaking and without losing anything of the Joy of Nature that was rushing forth in a movement of grateful recognition like an overwhelming flood. She accepted, she saw ‚Äì with all eternity before her ‚Äì that this supramental consciousness would fulfill her more perfectly and impart a still greater force to her movement and more richness, more possibilities to her play.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-564">And suddenly, as if resounding from every corner of the earth, I heard these great notes which are sometimes heard in the subtle physical ‚Äì rather like those of Beethoven's Concerto in D ‚Äì which come at moments of great progress, as though fifty orchestras were bursting forth all at once without a single discordant note, to sound the joy of this new communion of Nature and Spirit, the meeting of old friends who, after a long separation, find each other once more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-565">Then came these words: ‚ÄúO Nature, Material Mother, thou hast said that thou wilt collaborate, and there is no limit to the splendor of this collaboration.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-566">And the radiant felicity of this splendor was perceived in a perfect peace.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page133">Page 133</p>
<p class="PE"> Such was the birth of this year's message.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(Then Mother comments)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-567">I have one thing to add: we must not misinterpret the meaning of this experience and imagine that henceforth everything will take place without difficulties or always in accordance with our personal desires. It is not at this level. It does not mean that when we do not want it to rain, it will not rain! Or when we want some event to take place in the world, it will immediately take place, or that all difficulties will be abolished and everything will be like a fairytale. It is not like that. It is something more profound. Nature has accepted into her play of forces the newly manifested Force and has included it in her movements. But as always, the movements of Nature take place on a scale infinitely surpassing the human scale and invisible to the ordinary human consciousness. It is more of an inner, psychological possibility that has been born in the world than a spectacular change in earthly events.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-568">I mention this because you might be tempted to believe that fairytales are going to be realized upon earth. The time has not yet come.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-569">We must have a great deal of patience and a very wide and very complex vision to understand how things work.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-570">The miracles that are taking place are not what could be called literary miracles, for they do not take place as in storybooks. They are visible only to a very profound vision of things ‚Äì very profound, very comprehensive, very vast.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-571">You first have to be able to follow the methods and the means of the Grace to recognize its action. You first have to be able to remain unblinded by appearances to see the deeper truth of things.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-578">It is an error to confuse Joy and Felicity. They are two very different things. Not only are their vibrations different, but their colors are different. The color of Felicity is blue, a clear silvery blue (the blue of the Ashram flag), very luminous and transparent. And it has a passive and fresh quality that refreshes and rejuvenates.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-579">Whereas Joy is a golden rose color, a pale gold with a tinge of red, a very pale red. It is active, warm, fortifying, intensifying. The first is sweetness, the second is tenderness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-580">And Bliss ‚Äì what I spontaneously call Bliss ‚Äì is the synthesis of both. It is found in the very heights of the supramental consciousness, in a diamond light, an uncolored, sparkling light containing all the colors. Joy and Felicity form two sides of a triangle that has Bliss at its apex.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-581">Bliss contains coolness and warmth, passivity and activity, repose and action, sweetness and tenderness, all at the same time. Divine tenderness... is something very different from sweetness ‚Äì it is a paroxysm of joy, a vibration so strong that the body feels it will burst, so it is forced to widen.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page135">Page 135</p>
<p class="PE"> The diamond light of Bliss has the power to melt all hostile forces. Nothing can resist it. No consciousness, no being, no hostile will can draw near it without immediately being dissolved, for it is the Divine light in its pure creative power.</p>

<p class="Q"> <em>(The following experience was later read out to the Wednesday class on 2.19.58)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-591">Between the beings of the supramental world and men, there exists approximately the same gap as between men and animals. Sometime ago, I had the experience of identification with animal life, and it is a fact that animals do not understand us; their consciousness is so constituted that we elude them almost entirely. And yet I have known domestic animals ‚Äì cats and dogs, but especially cats ‚Äì who made an almost yogic effort of consciousness to understand us. But generally, when they watch us living and acting, they don't understand, they don't <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEE US</span> as we are, and they suffer because of us. We are a constant enigma to them. Only a very tiny part of their consciousness is linked to us. And it is the same for us when we try to look at the supramental world. Only when the link of consciousness has been built shall we see it ‚Äì and even then, only that part of our being which has undergone the transformation will be capable of seeing it as it is ‚Äì otherwise the two worlds would remain as separate as the animal world and the human world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-592">The experience I had on February 3 proves this. Before, I had had an individual, subjective contact with the supramental world, whereas on February 3, I went strolling there in a concrete way ‚Äì as concretely as I used to go strolling in Paris in times past ‚Äì in a world that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EXISTS IN ITSELF</span>, beyond all subjectivity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-593">It is like a bridge being built between the two worlds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-594">This is the experience as I dictated it immediately thereafter:</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-595">The supramental world exists in a permanent way, and I am there permanently in a supramental body. I had proof of this today when my earthly consciousness went there and consciously remained there between two and three o'clock in the afternoon: I now know that for the two worlds to join in a constant and conscious relationship what is missing is an intermediate zone between the existing physical world and the supramental world as it exists. This zone has yet to be built, both in the individual consciousness and in the objective world, and it is being built. When</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page138">Page 138</p>
<p class="PE"> formerly I used to speak of the new world that is being created, I was speaking of this intermediate zone. And similarly, when I am on ‚Äúthis‚Äù side ‚Äì that is, in the realm of the physical consciousness ‚Äì and I see the supramental power, the supramental light and substance constantly permeating matter, I am seeing and participating in the construction of this zone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-596">I found myself upon an immense ship, which is the symbolic representation of the place where this work is being carried out. This ship, as big as a city, is thoroughly organized, and it had certainly already been functioning for quite some time, for its organization was fully developed. It is the place where people destined for the supramental life are being trained. These people (or at least a part of their being) had already undergone a supramental transformation because the ship itself and all that was aboard was neither material nor subtle-physical, neither vital nor mental: it was a supramental substance. This substance itself was of the most material supramental, the supramental substance nearest the physical world, the first to manifest. The light was a blend of red and gold, forming a uniform substance of luminous orange. Everything was like that ‚Äì the light was like that, the people were like that ‚Äì everything had this color, in varying shades, however, which enabled things to be distinguished from one another. The overall impression was of a shadowless world: there were shades, but no shadows. The atmosphere was full of joy, calm, order; everything worked smoothly and silently. At the same time, I could see all the details of the education, the training in all domains by which the people on board were being prepared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-597">This immense ship had just arrived at the shore of the supramental world, and a first batch of people destined to become the future inhabitants of the supramental world were about to disembark. Everything was arranged for this first landing. A certain number of very tall beings were posted on the wharf. They were not human beings and never before had they been men. Nor were they permanent inhabitants of the supramental world. They had been delegated from above and posted there to control and supervise the landing. I was in charge of all this since the beginning and throughout. I myself had prepared all the groups. I was standing on the bridge of the ship, calling the groups forward one by one and having them disembark on the shore. The tall beings posted there seemed to be reviewing those who were disembarking, allowing those who were ready to go ashore and sending</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page139">Page 139</p>
<p class="PE"> back those who were not and who had to continue their training aboard the ship. While standing there watching everyone, that part of my consciousness coming from here became extremely interested: it wanted to see, to identify all the people, to see how they had changed and to find out who had been taken immediately as well as those who had to remain and continue their training. After awhile, as I was observing, I began to feel pulled backwards and that my body was being awakened by a consciousness or a person from here<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="43" href="#">1</a> ‚Äì and in my consciousness, I protested: ‚ÄúNo, no, not yet! Not yet! I want to see who's there!‚Äù I was watching all this and noting it with intense interest... It went on like that until, suddenly, the clock here began striking three, which violently jerked me back. There was the sensation of a sudden fall into my body. I came back with a shock, but since I had been called back very suddenly, all my memory was still intact. I remained quiet and still until I could bring back the whole experience and preserve it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-598">The nature of objects on this ship was not that which we know upon earth; for example, the clothes were not made of cloth, and this thing that resembled cloth was not manufactured ‚Äì it was a part of the body, made of the same substance that took on different forms. It had a kind of plasticity. When a change had to be made, it was done not by artificial and outer means but by an inner working, by a working of the consciousness that gave the substance its form or appearance. Life created its own forms. There was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE SINGLE</span> substance in all things; it changed the nature of its vibration according to the needs or uses.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-599">Those who were sent back for more training were not of a uniform color; their bodies seemed to have patches of a grayish opacity, a substance resembling the earth substance. They were dull, as though they had not been wholly permeated by the light or wholly transformed. They were not like this all over, but in places.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-600">The tall beings on the shore were not of the same color, at least they did not have this orange tint; they were paler, more transparent. Except for a part of their bodies, only the outline of their forms could be seen. They were very tall, they did not seem to have a skeletal structure, and they could take on any form according to their needs. Only from their waists to their feet did they have a permanent density, which was not felt in the rest of their body. Their color was much more pallid and contained very</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page140">Page 140</p>
<p class="PE"> little red, it verged rather on gold or even white. The parts of whitish light were translucid; they were not absolutely transparent, but less dense, more subtle than the orange substance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-601">Just as I was called back, when I was saying, ‚ÄúNot yet...,‚Äù I had a quick glimpse of myself, of my form in the supramental world. I was a mixture of what these tall beings were and the beings aboard the ship. The top part of myself, especially my head, was a mere silhouette of a whitish color with an orange fringe. The more it approached the feet, the more the color resembled that of the people on the ship, or in other words, orange; the more it went up towards the top, the more translucid and white it was, and the red faded. The head was only a silhouette with a brilliant sun at its center; from it issued rays of light which were the action of the will.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-602">As for the people I saw aboard ship, I recognized them all. Some were here in the Ashram, some came from elsewhere, but I knew them as well. I saw everyone, but as I realized that I would not remember everyone when I came back, I decided not to give any names. Besides, it is unnecessary. Three or four faces were very clearly visible, and when I saw them, I understood the feeling that I have had here, on earth, while looking into their eyes: there was such an extraordinary joy... On the whole, the people were young; there were very few children, and their ages were around fourteen or fifteen, but certainly not below ten or twelve (I did not stay long enough to see all the details). There were no very old people, with the exception of a few. Most of the people who had gone ashore were of a middle age ‚Äì again, except for a few. Several times before this experience, certain individual cases had already been examined at a place where people capable of being supramentalized are examined; I had then had a few surprises which I had noted ‚Äì I even told some people. But those whom I disembarked today I saw very distinctly. They were of a middle age, neither young children nor elderly people, with only a few rare exceptions, and this quite corresponded to what I expected. I decided not to say anything, not to give any names. As I did not stay until the end, it would be impossible for me to draw an exact picture, for it was neither absolutely clear nor complete. I do not want to say things to some and not say them to others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-603">What I can say is that the criterion or the judgment was based <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EXCLUSIVELY</span> on the substance constituting the people ‚Äì whether they belonged completely to the supramental world or not, whether they were made of this very special substance. The</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page141">Page 141</p>
<p class="PE"> criterion adopted was neither moral nor psychological. It is likely that their bodily substance was the result of an inner law or an inner movement which, at that time, was not in question. At least it is quite clear that the values are different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-604">When I came back, along with the memory of the experience, I knew that the supramental world was permanent, that my presence there is permanent, and that only a missing link is needed to allow the consciousness and the substance to connect ‚Äì and it is this link that is being built. At that time, my impression (an impression which remained rather long, almost the whole day) was of an extreme relativity ‚Äì no, not exactly that, but an impression that the relationship between this world and the other completely changes the criterion by which things are to be evaluated or judged. This criterion had nothing mental about it, and it gave the strange inner feeling that so many things we consider good or bad are not really so. It was very clear that everything depended upon the capacity of things and upon their ability to express the supramental world or be in relationship with it. It was so completely different, at times even so opposite to our ordinary way of looking at things! I recall one little thing that we usually consider bad... actually how funny it was to see that it is something excellent! And other things that we consider important were really quite unimportant there! Whether it was like this or like that made no difference. What is very obvious is that our appreciation of what is divine or not divine is incorrect. I even laughed at certain things... Our usual feeling about what is anti-divine seems artificial, based upon something untrue, unliving (besides, what we call life here appeared lifeless in comparison with that world); in any event, this feeling should be based upon our relationship between the two worlds and according to whether things make this relationship easier or more difficult. This would thus completely change our evaluation of what brings us nearer to the Divine or what takes us away from Him. With people, too, I saw that what helps them or prevents them from becoming supramental is very different from what our ordinary moral notions imagine. I felt just how... ridiculous we are.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-605">There is a continuation to all this, which is like the result in my consciousness of the experience of February 3, but it seems</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page142">Page 142</p>
<p class="PE"> premature to read it now. It will appear in the April issue [of the Bulletin], as a sequel to this.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-606">But one thing ‚Äì and I wish to stress this point to you ‚Äì which now seems to me to be the most essential difference between our world and the supramental world (and it is only after having gone there consciously, with the consciousness that ordinarily works here, that this difference appeared to me in what might be called its enormity): everything here, except for what happens within and at a very deep level, seemed absolutely artificial to me. Not one of the values of ordinary physical life is based upon truth. Just as we have to buy cloth, sew it together, then put it on our backs in order to dress ourselves, likewise we have to take things from outside and then put them inside our bodies in order to feed ourselves. For everything, our life is artificial.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-607">A true, sincere, spontaneous life, as in the supramental world, is a springing forth of things through the fact of conscious will, a power over substance that shapes this substance according to what we decide it should be. And he who has this power and this knowledge can obtain whatever he wants, whereas he who does not has no artificial means of getting what he desires.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-608">In ordinary life, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> is artificial. Depending upon the chance of your birth or circumstances, you have a more or less high position or a more or less comfortable life, not because it is the spontaneous, natural and sincere expression of your way of being and of your inner need, but because the fortuity of life's circumstances has placed you in contact with these things. An absolutely worthless man may be in a very high position, and a man who might have marvelous capacities of creation and organization may find himself toiling in a quite limited and inferior position, whereas he would be a wholly useful individual if the world were sincere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-609">It is this artificiality, this insincerity, this complete lack of truth that appeared so shocking to me that... one wonders how, in a world as false as this one, we can arrive at any truthful evaluation of things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-610">But instead of feeling grieved, morose, rebellious, discontent, I had rather the feeling of what I spoke of at the end: of such a ridiculous absurdity that for several days I was seized with an uncontrollable laughter whenever I saw things and people!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-612">Everyone carries with him, in his atmosphere, what Sri Aurobindo calls the ‚ÄúCensors‚Äù; in a way, they are the permanent delegates of the hostile forces. Their role is to criticize mercilessly each act, each thought, the least movement of the consciousness, and to place you before the most hidden motives of your behavior, to expose the least lower vibration accompanying your apparently purest or highest thoughts or acts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-613">It is not here a question of morality. These gentlemen are not moralizing agents, although they know very well how to make use of morality! And when they are dealing with a scrupulous conscience, they can harass it pitilessly, whisper to it at every minute, ‚ÄúYou should not have done this, you should not have done that, you should have done such and such, said such and such; now you have ruined everything, you have made an irreparable mistake, just see how everything is irremediably lost now because of the mistake you made.‚Äù They can even possess the consciousness of some people: you chase the thought away and vrrm! ‚Äì two minutes later, back it comes! You chase it away again, but there it is still hammering away at you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-614">Each time I meet these gentlemen, I give them a hearty welcome, for they force you to be absolutely sincere, they unearth the subtlest hypocrisy and at each moment place you before your most secret vibrations. And they are intelligent, with an intelligence infinitely surpassing our own! They know everything, they know how to set your least thought against you, your least</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page144">Page 144</p>
<p class="PE"> argument or action, with a really wonderful subtlety. Nothing escapes them. But what gives a hostile shading to these beings is that, first and foremost, they are defeatists. They always present you with the darkest side of the picture and if necessary distort your own intentions. They are truly instruments of sincerity. Yet they always overlook one thing, deliberately, something they reject and cast far behind, as if it didn't exist ‚Äì the divine Grace. They overlook prayer, this spontaneous prayer that suddenly surges up from the depths of your being like an intense call and makes the Grace descend and changes the course of things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-615">And each time that you have made some progress or passed to a higher level, they put you back in the presence of all the actions of your past and in a few months, a few days or a few minutes make you pass all the tests again, at a higher level. And it does not help to brush aside the thought, saying, ‚ÄúOh, I know!‚Äù and throw a little cloak over it so as not to see. You have to face and conquer, keep your consciousness filled with light, be unwavering, uncomplaining, without a single vibration in the cells of the body, and then the attack dissolves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-616"><em>The other day, too, in your supramental experience, you said that moral values had lost all their meaning.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-617">But our conceptions of Good and Evil are so ridiculous! Our ideas of what is near to the Divine or far from the Divine are so absurd! The experience of the other day [February 3] was quite a revelation to me, and I came out of it utterly changed. I suddenly understood a great many things from the past ‚Äì certain actions, parts of my life that had remained inexplicable ‚Äì in truth, the shortest path from one point to another is not the straight line we imagine!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-618">And the whole time this experience lasted, one hour (an hour of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> time is long!), I was in an extraordinarily mirthful, almost inebriated state... The difference between the two consciousnesses is such that when you are in one, the other seems unreal, like a dream. When I came back, I was at first struck by the futility of life here; our petty conceptions seem so comical, so laughable... We say that certain people are mad, but their madness is perhaps a great wisdom from the supramental point of view, and their behavior is perhaps very near the truth of things ‚Äì I am not speaking of the obscure insane who have had some brain disorder, but of many other incomprehensible mad</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page145">Page 145</p>
<p class="PE"> people, the luminous mad: they have wanted to leap across the border too quickly, and the rest did not follow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-619">When one looks at the world of men from the supramental consciousness, the dominant characteristic is a feeling of oddity, of artificiality ‚Äì a world that is absurd because it is artificial. This world is false because its material appearance does not at all express the profound truth of things. There is as if a discrepancy between the appearance and what lies within. Thus, a man with a divine power deep within him may, on the outer plane, find himself in the situation of a slave. It's preposterous! Whereas in the supramental world, the will acts directly upon the substance, and the substance is obedient to this will. When you want to clothe yourself, the substance you are living in immediately assumes the form of clothing to cover you. When you want to move from one place to another, your will is sufficient to carry you without your needing any kind of vehicle or artificial means. Thus, for example, the ship in my experience had no need of any mechanism whatsoever in order to move; it was the will that shaped the substance according to its needs. When it was necessary to disembark, the wharf formed by itself. When I wanted the groups to go ashore, those who had to do so automatically knew it, without my having to say a word, and they came in the right order. Everything took place in silence, there was no need to speak to be understood; but aboard the ship, the silence itself did not give this artificial impression it gives here. Here, when we want silence, we have to keep our mouths shut: silence is the opposite of noise. There, the silence was vibrant, living, active and comprehensive, comprehensible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-620">The absurdity here consists of all the artificial means that have to be used. Any imbecile has more power if he has more means by which to acquire the necessary artifice. Whereas in the supramental world, the more one is conscious and in contact with the truth of things, the more authority has the will over the substance. The authority is a true authority. If you want clothes, you have to have the power to make them, a real power. If you do not have this power, well then, you remain naked. There are no artificial means to compensate for this lack of power. Here, not once in a million times is authority the expression of something true. Everything is colossally stupid.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-621">When I came back down (‚Äúcame back down‚Äù is a manner of speaking, for it is neither high nor low, nor within nor without, it is... somewhere), it took me a while to readjust. I even recall</p>

<p class="PE"> having said to someone, ‚ÄúNow we are going to regress into our usual stupidity.‚Äù But I understood a lot of things, and I came back from there with a decisive force.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-623">For me, this subtle world is far more real than the material world ‚Äì much truer, much more tangible, concrete, real ‚Äì but for others in this material world to believe in the subtle worlds, either they must have some beginning of experience, or else they must agree to have confidence and say, ‚ÄúAll right, they say it's like that, therefore it must be like that.‚Äù Otherwise, to be convinced, they want the truth to manifest in a world of falsehood in spite of the falsehood. Their attitude is like this: ‚ÄúWe are willing to admit that it is possible, that it is real, but as long as it has not manifested here, we do not quite believe in it.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-625">The question remains: for those who have seen and to whom things have happened in this way (like the little child, for example, who was playing with fairies), is it that they enter into this consciousness and then remember when they leave it, or is it that this state really manifests here? For me, this is still a question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-626">As this experience often happens to people with a simple heart and mind, quite possibly they don't realize that for a while they have lived in another consciousness and in another world and then have come back to an ordinary condition where they remember the other thing.

And I feel an infinite gratitude that you are there, and that this thread from you to me keeps me anchored to something in this world.

Apart from this, I am holding up quite well physically. But inside and outside, nothing is left but you. I need you, that's all. Mother, this world is so horrifyingly empty.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-649">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-650">I was waiting for things to be well established in me before writing you again. An important change has occurred: it seems that something in me has ‚Äúclicked‚Äù ‚Äì what Sri Aurobindo calls the ‚Äúcentral will,‚Äù perhaps ‚Äì and I am living literally in the obsession of divine realization. This is what I want, nothing else, it is the only goal in life, and at last I have understood (not with the head) that the outer realization in the world will be the consequence of</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page152">Page 152</p>
<p class="PE"> the inner realization. So thousands of times a day, I repeat, ‚ÄúMother, I want to be your instrument, ever more conscious, I want to express your truth, your light. I want to be what you want, as you want, when you want.‚Äù There is in me now a kind of need for perfection, a will to abolish this ego, a real understanding that to become your instrument means at the same time to find the perfect plenitude of one's personality. So I am living in an almost constant state of aspiration, I feel your force constantly, or nearly so, and if I am ‚Äúdistracted‚Äù a few minutes, I experience a void, an uneasiness that calls me back to you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-651">And at the same time, I <em>saw</em> that it is you who is doing everything, you who aspires in me, you who wants the progress, and that all ‚ÄúI‚Äù myself am in this affair is a screen, a resisting obstacle. O Mother, break this screen that I may be wholly transparent before you, that your transforming force may purify all the secret recesses in my being, that nothing may remain but you and you alone. O Mother, may all my being be a living expression of your light, your truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-652">Mother, from the depths of my being, I offer you a sole prayer: may I become your more and more perfect instrument, a sword of light in your hands. Oh, to get out of this ego that belittles everything, diminishes everything, to emerge from it! All is falsehood in it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-653">And I, who understood nothing of love, am beginning to suspect who Satprem is. Mother, your grace is infinite, it has accompanied me everywhere in my life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-654">We are still in Kataragama, and we shall only go up to northern Ceylon, to Jaffna, around the 15th, then return to India towards the beginning of May if the visa problems are settled. Only in India, at the temple of Rameswaram, can I receive the orange robe. I am living here as a sannyasi, but dressed in white, like a Hindu. It is a stark life, nothing more. I have seen, however, that truth does not lie in starkness but in a change of consciousness. (Desire always finds a means to entrench itself in very small details and in very petty and stupid, though well-rooted, avidities.)</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-669">This morning, I suddenly looked at my body (usually, I don't look at it ‚Äì I am inside it, working), I looked at my body and said to myself, ‚ÄúLet's see, what would a witness say about this body?‚Äù ‚Äì the witness Sri Aurobindo speaks of in <em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>. Nothing very remarkable. So I formulated it like this <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother reads a written note)</em></span>:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-670">‚ÄúThis body has neither the uncontested authority of a god nor the imperturbable calm of the sage.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-671">So, what then?</p>

<p class="PE"> ‚ÄúIt is as yet only an apprentice in supermanhood.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-672">That is all it is trying to be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-673">I saw and understood very well that by concentrating, I could have given it the attitude of the absolute authority of the eternal Mother. When Sri Aurobindo told me, ‚ÄúYou are She,‚Äù at the same time he bestowed upon my body this attitude of absolute authority. But as I had the inner vision of this truth, I concerned myself very little with the imperfections of the physical body ‚Äì I didn't bother about that, I only used it as an instrument. Sri Aurobindo did the sadhana for this body, which had only to remain constantly open to his action.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-674">Afterwards, when he left and I had to do the Yoga myself, to be able to take his physical place, I could have adopted the attitude of the sage, which is what I did since I was in an unparalleled state of calm when he left. As he left his body and entered into mine, he told me, ‚ÄúYou will continue, you will go right to the end of the work.‚Äù It was then that I imposed a calm upon this body ‚Äì the calm of total detachment. And I could have remained like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-675">But in a way, absolute calm implies withdrawal from action, so a choice had to be made between one or the other. I said to myself, ‚ÄúI am neither exclusively this nor exclusively that.‚Äù And actually, to do Sri Aurobindo's work is to realize the Supramental on earth. So I began that work and, as a matter of fact, this was the only thing I asked of my body. I told it, ‚ÄúNow you shall set right everything which is out of order and gradually realize this intermediate supermanhood between man and the supramental being or, in other words, what I call the superman.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-676">And this is what I have been doing for the last eight years, and even much more during the past two years, since 1956. Now it is the work of each day, each minute.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-677">That's where I am. I have renounced the uncontested authority of a god, I have renounced the unshakable calm of the sage... in order to become the superman. I have concentrated everything upon that.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-681">The difficulty is greater for Westerners than for Indians. It's as though their substance were steeped in falsehood. It also happens with Indians, of course, but generally the falsehood is much more in the vital than in the physical ‚Äì because after all, the physical has been utilized by bodies belonging to enlightened beings. The European substance seems steeped in rebellion; in the Indian substance, this rebelliousness is subdued by an influence of <em>surrender</em>. The other day, someone was telling me about some Europeans with whom he corresponds, and I said, ‚ÄúBut tell them to read, to learn, to follow <em>The Synthesis of</em> Yoga! ‚Äì it leads you straight to the path.‚Äù Whereupon he replied, ‚ÄúOh, but they say it's full of talk on surrender, surrender, always surrender...‚Äù and they want none of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-682">They want none of it! Even if the mind accepts, the body and the vital refuse. And when the body refuses, it refuses with the stubbornness of a stone.</p>

It reeks! I know it well. I know it very well. These laws reek of falsehood. In the body, we have no faith in the divine Grace, none, none, none, none! Those who have not undergone a tapasya<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="47" href="#">2</a> as I have, say, ‚ÄúYes, all these inner moral things, feelings, psychology, all that is very good; we want the Divine and we are ready to...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-685">We must understand that this isn't true ‚Äì it isn't true, it's a falsehood, all this is sheer falsehood. It is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT TRUE</span>, it is not true!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-687">When I had this experience, I understood that only a month ago I was still uttering mountain-sized imbecilities. And I laughed to the point of almost approving those who say, ‚ÄúBut all the same, the Supreme does not decide the number of sugar cubes you put in your coffee! That would be to project your own way of being onto the Supreme.‚Äù But this is an Himalayan imbecility! It is a stupidity, the mind's pretentious stupidity projecting itself onto the divine life and imagining that the divine life conforms to its own projection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-688">The Supreme does not decide: He knows. The Supreme does not want: He sees. And it is so for each thousandth of a second, eternally. That's all. And it is the only true condition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-689">I know that the experience I had the other day is new and that I was the first person on earth to have it. But it is the only thing that is true. All the rest...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-690">I began my sadhana at birth, without knowing that I was doing it. I have continued it throughout my whole life, which means for almost eighty years (even though for perhaps the first three or four years of my life it was only something stirring about in unconsciousness). But I began a deliberate, conscious sadhana at about the age of twenty-two or twenty-three, upon prepared ground. I am now more than eighty years old: I have thought of nothing but that, I have wanted nothing but that, I had no other interest in life, and not for a single minute have I ever forgotten that it was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> that I wanted. There were not periods of remembering and forgetting: it was continuous, unceasing, day and night, from the age of twenty-four ‚Äì and I had this experience for the first time about a week ago! So, I say that people who are in a hurry, people who are impatient, are arrogant fools.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-691">...It is a hard path. I try to make it as comfortable as possible, but nevertheless, it is a hard path. And it is obvious that it cannot be otherwise. You are beaten and battered until you understand. Until you are in that state in which all bodies are your body. But at that point, you begin to laugh! You were upset by this, hurt by that, you suffered from this or that ‚Äì but now, how laughable it all seems! And not only the head, but the body too finds it laughable!</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-692">...but it is so deeply rooted: all the reactions of the</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page158">Page 158</p>
<p class="PE"> body-consciousness are like that, with a kind of shrinking at the idea of allowing a higher power to intervene.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-693">From the positive point of view, I am convinced that we agree upon the result to be obtained, that is, an integral and unreserved consecration ‚Äì in love, knowledge and action ‚Äì to the Supreme <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AND TO HIS WORK</span>. I say to the Supreme and to his work because consecration to the Supreme alone is not enough. Now we are here for the supramental realization, this is what is expected of us, but to reach it, our consecration to it must be total, unreserved, absolutely integral. I believe you have understood this ‚Äì in other words, that you have the will to realize it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-694">From the negative point of view ‚Äì I mean the difficulties to be overcome ‚Äì one of the most serious obstacles is that the ignorant and falsifying outer consciousness, the ordinary consciousness legitimizes all the so-called physical laws, causes, effects and consequences, all that science has discovered physically and materially. All this is an unquestionable reality to the consciousness, a reality that remains independent and absolute even in the face of the eternal divine Reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-695">And it is so automatic that it is unconscious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-696">When it is a question of movements like anger, desire, etc., you recognize that they are wrong and must disappear, but when material laws are in question ‚Äì laws of the body, for example, its needs, its health, its nourishment, all those things ‚Äì they have such a solid, compact, established and concrete reality that it appears absolutely unquestionable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-697">Well, to be able to cure that, which of all the obstacles is the greatest (I mean the habit of putting spiritual life on one side and material life on the other, of acknowledging the right of material laws to exist), one must make a resolution never to legitimize any of these movements, at any cost.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-698">To be able to see the problem as it is, it is absolutely indispensable, as a first step, to get out of the mental consciousness, even out of a mental transcription (in the highest mind) of the supramental vision and truth. A thing cannot be seen as it is, in its truth, except in the supramental consciousness, and if you try to explain, it immediately begins to escape you because you are obliged to give it a mental formulation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-699">As for me, I saw the thing only at the time of this experience,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="49" href="#">4</a></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page159">Page 159</p>
<p class="PE"> and as a result of this experience. But it is impossible to formulate even the experience itself, and as soon as I endeavored to formulate it and the more I was able to formulate it, the more the thing faded, escaped.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-700">Consequently, if you do not remember having had the experience, you are left in the same condition as before, but with the difference that now you know, you can know, that these material laws do not correspond to the truth ‚Äì that's all. They do not at all correspond to the truth, so consequently, if you want to be faithful to your aspiration, you must in no way legitimize all that. Rather, you must say that it is an infirmity from which we are suffering for the moment, for an intermediate period ‚Äì it is an infirmity and an ignorance ‚Äì for it really is an ignorance (this is not just a word): it is ignorance, it is not the thing as it is, even in regard to our present material bodies. Therefore, we will not legitimize anything. What we say is this ‚Äì it is an infirmity which has to be endured for the time being, until we get out of it, but we do <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT ACKNOWLEDGE</span> all this as a concrete reality. It does <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> have a concrete reality, it has a false reality ‚Äì what we call concrete reality is a false reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-701">And the proof ‚Äì I have the proof because I experienced it myself ‚Äì is that from the minute you are in the other consciousness, the true consciousness, all these things which appear so real, so concrete, change <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INSTANTLY</span>. There are a number of things, certain material conditions of my body ‚Äì material ‚Äì that changed instantly. It did not last long enough for everything to change, but some things changed and never returned, they remained changed. In other words, if that consciousness were kept constantly, it would be a perpetual miracle (what we would call a miracle from our ordinary point of view), a fantastic and perpetual miracle! But from the supramental point of view, it would not be a miracle at all, it would be the most normal of things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-702">Therefore, if we do not want to oppose the supramental action by an obscure, inert and obstinate resistance, we have to admit once and for all that none of these things should be legitimized.</p>

I have seen that practically, in the case of almost all the people who write to me saying, ‚ÄúI am being violently attacked by hostile forces,‚Äù it's an excuse they are giving. It means that certain things in their nature do not want to yield, so they put all the blame on the hostile forces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-715">As a matter of fact, my tendency is more and more towards something in which the role of these hostile forces will be reduced to that of an examiner ‚Äì which means that they are there to test the sincerity of your spiritual quest. These elements have a reality in their action and for the work ‚Äì this is their great reality ‚Äì but when you go beyond a certain region, it all grows dim to such a degree that it is no longer so well defined, so distinct. In the occult world, or rather if you look at the world from the occult point of view, these hostile forces are very real, their action is very real, quite concrete, and their attitude towards the divine realization is positively hostile; but as soon as you go beyond this region and enter into the spiritual world where there is no longer anything but the Divine in all things, and where there is nothing undivine, then these ‚Äúhostile forces‚Äù become part of the total play and can no longer be called ‚Äúhostile forces‚Äù: it is only an attitude that they have adopted ‚Äì or more precisely, it is only an attitude adopted by the Divine in his play.</p>

Because everything on earth fades away ‚Äì everything fades away, nothing remains. In this sense, there has never been any realization, for everything fades away. Nothing is ever permanent. And I know for myself: I am doing the sadhana at a gallop, as it were; never are two experiences identical nor do they recur in the same way. As soon as something is established, the next thing begins immediately. It may appear to fade away, but it doesn't fade away; rather, it is the basis upon which the next thing is built.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-718">It was represented by a kind of image in which I was as vast as the Universe, and each way of approaching the Divine was like a tiny image containing the characteristic form of this approach.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-721">From that moment on, I was conscious that all one does is the expression of the indwelling Divine Will. But it is the Divine Will <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT THE VERY CENTER</span> of oneself, although for a while there remained an activity in the physical mind. But this was stilled two or three days after I saw Sri Aurobindo for the first time in 1914,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page164">Page 164</p>
<p class="PE"> and it never started up again. Silence settled. And the consciousness was established above the head.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-722">In the first experience [of 1910], the consciousness was established in the psychic depths of the being, and from that poise issued the feeling of no longer doing anything but what the Divine wanted ‚Äì it was the consciousness that the divine Will was all-powerful and that there was no longer any personal will, although there was still some mental activity and everything had to be made silent. In 1914, it was silenced, and the consciousness was established above the head. Here <span class="note_1"><em>(the heart)</em></span> and here <span class="note_1"><em>(above the head)</em></span>, the connection is constant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-723"><em>Does one exclude the other?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-724">They exist simultaneously; it's the same thing. When you start becoming truly conscious, you realize that it depends upon the kinds of activities you have to do. When you do a certain kind of work, it is in the heart that the Force gathers to radiate outwards, and when you do another kind of work, it is above the head that the Force concentrates to radiate outwards, but the two are not separate: the center of activity is here or there depending upon what you have to do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-725">As for the latest experience,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">1</a> I can't say for sure that no one has ever had it, because someone like Ramakrishna, individuals like that, could have had it. But I am not sure, for when I had this experience (not of the divine Presence, which I had already felt in the cells for a long time, but the experience that the Divine <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALONE</span> is acting in the body, that He has <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BECOME</span> the body, yet all the while retaining his character of divine omniscience and omnipotence), well, the whole time it remained actively like that, it was absolutely impossible to have the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LEAST</span> disorder in the body, and not only in the body, but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN ALL THE SURROUNDING MATTER</span>. It was as if every object obeyed without even needing to decide to obey: it was automatic. There was a divine harmony in <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> (it took place in my bathroom upstairs, certainly to demonstrate that it exists in the most trivial things), in everything, constantly. So if that is established in a permanent way, there <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAN NO LONGER</span> be illness, it is impossible. There can no longer be accidents, there can no longer be illness, there can no longer be disorders, and everything should harmonize (probably in a progressive way) just as that</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page165">Page 165</p>
<p class="PE"> was harmonized: all the objects in the bathroom were full of a joyful enthusiasm ‚Äì everything obeyed, everything!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-726">As it was the first experience, it started to fade slightly when I began having contact with people; but I really had the feeling that it was a first experience, new upon earth. For I have experienced an absolute identity of the will with the divine Will ever since 1910, it has never left me. It isn't that, it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SOMETHING ELSE</span>. It is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MATTER BECOMING THE DIVINE</span>. And it really came with the feeling that this thing was happening for the first time upon earth. It is difficult to say for sure, but Ramakrishna died of cancer, and now that I have had the experience, I know in an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ABSOLUTE</span> way that this is impossible. If he had decided to go because the Divine wanted him to go, it would have been an orderly departure, in total harmony and with a total will, whereas this illness is a means of disorder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-727"><em>Is this experience of May 1 related to the Supramental Manifestation of 1956? Is it a supramental experience?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-728">It is the result of the descent of the supramental substance into Matter. Only this substance ‚Äì what it has put into physical Matter ‚Äì could have made it possible. It is a new ferment. From the material standpoint, it removes from physical Matter its tamas, the heaviness of its unconsciousness, and from the psychological standpoint, its ignorance and its falsehood. Matter is subtilized. But it has surely come only as a first experience to show how it will be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-729">It is truly a state of absolute omniscience and omnipotence in the body which changes all the vibrations around it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-730">It is likely that the greatest resistance will be in the most conscious beings due to a lack of mental receptivity, due to the mind itself which wants things to continue (as Sri Aurobindo has written) according to its own mode of ignorance. So-called inert matter is much more easily responsive, much more ‚Äì it does not resist. And I am convinced that among plants, for example, or among animals, the response will be much quicker than among men. It will be more difficult to act upon a very organized mind; beings who live in an entirely crystallized, organized mental consciousness are as hard as stone! It resists. According to my experience, what is unconscious will certainly follow more easily. It was a delight to see the water from the tap, the mouthwash in the bottle, the glass, the sponge ‚Äì it all had such an air of joy and consent! There is much less ego, you see, it is not a conscious ego.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page166">Page 166</p>
<p class="PE"> The ego becomes more and more conscious and resistant as the being develops. Very primitive, very simple beings, little children will respond first, because they don't have an organized ego. But these big people! People who have worked on themselves, who have mastered themselves, who are organized, who have an ego made of steel, it will be difficult for them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-731">Unless they go beyond all this and have enough spiritual knowledge to be able to make the ego surrender... in which case the realization will naturally be much greater ‚Äì it will be more difficult to accomplish, but the result will be far more complete.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-732"><em>When you had this experience of February 3, 1958 [the supramental ship], the vision of your usual consciousness, which is nevertheless a Truth Consciousness, no longer seemed true to you at all.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-733">Yes, one enters into another world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-734">This consciousness here is true in relation to this world as it is, but the other... is something else entirely. An adjustment is needed for the two to touch, otherwise one jumps from one to the other. And that serves no purpose. A progressive passage has to be built between the two. This means that a whole number of rungs of consciousness are missing. This consciousness here must consciously connect with that consciousness there, which means a multitude of stairs passing from one to the other. Then we will be able to rise up progressively, and the whole will arise.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-735">Its action will be somewhat similar to what is described in the Last Judgment, which is an entirely symbolic expression of something that makes us discern between what belongs to the world of falsehood which is destined to disappear and what belongs to this same world of ignorance and inertia but is transformable. One will go to one side and the other to the other side. All that is transformable will be permeated more and more with this new substance and this new consciousness to such an extent that it will rise towards it and serve as a link between the two, but all that belongs incorrigibly to falsehood and ignorance will disappear. This was also prophesied in the <em>Gita:</em> among what we call the hostile or anti-divine forces, those capable of being transformed will be uplifted and go off towards the new consciousness, whereas all that is irrevocably in darkness or belongs to an evil will shall be destroyed and vanish from the Universe. And a whole</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page167">Page 167</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(At the time of publishing the following conversation of March 19, 1958, in the Ashram ‚ÄúBulletin,‚Äù Mother added certain commentaries that have a direct bearing upon the preceding conversation about the Last Judgment, and She incorporated an entire passage from the conversation of the end of February 1958 on the same subject.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-736">One thing seems clear: humanity has reached such a generalized state of tension ‚Äì tension in effort, tension in action, tension even in daily life ‚Äì with such an excessive hyperactivity, such an overall restlessness, that the species as a whole seems to have reached a point where it must either burst through the resistance and surge forth into a new consciousness, or else sink back into an abysm of obscurity and inertia.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-737">This tension is so total and so generalized that obviously something must break. It cannot go on like this. Yet all this is a sure sign that a new principle of force, consciousness and power has been infused into matter and by its very pressure has produced this acute state. Outwardly, we might expect to see the old habitual means used by Nature whenever she wants to bring about an upheaval; but here there is a new phenomenon, which is evidently visible only in a select few, although even these few are widespread enough ‚Äì this phenomenon is not localized in one point or one place in the world, for the signs are to be found in every country all over the earth: the will to find a new, a higher, an ascending solution, an effort to surge forth into a vaster, more encompassing perfection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-738">Certain ideas of a more general, more extensive, more collective nature, as it were, are being worked out and are at work in the world. And the two go together: a greater and more total possibility of destruction and an inventiveness that unrestrainedly</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page168">Page 168</p>
<p class="PE"> increases the possibility of catastrophe, a catastrophe that would be much more massive than it has ever been; and at the same time, the birth, or rather the manifestation, of much higher and more comprehensive ideas and wills which, when heard, will bring a vaster, more extensive, more complete and more perfect solution than before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-739">This struggle, this conflict between the constructive forces of an ascending evolution, of an increasingly perfect and divine realization, and the more and more destructive forces ‚Äì powerfully destructive, forces of an uncontrollable madness ‚Äì is becoming more obvious, unmistakably visible, and it is a kind of race or battle as to which will be first to reach its goal. All the hostile, anti-divine forces, these forces of the vital world, seem to have descended upon earth and are using it as their field of action; and at the same time, a new, higher, more powerful spiritual force has also descended upon earth to bring a new life to it. This renders the battle more bitter, violent and visible, but apparently more decisive, too, which is why we may hope to arrive at an early solution.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-740">There was a time, not so very long ago, when man's spiritual aspiration was turned towards a silent, inactive peace, detached from all the things of this world, an evasion of life to avoid the struggle, precisely, to rise above the battle, to be liberated from effort. It was a spiritual peace where, along with the cessation of tension, struggle and effort, suffering in all its forms also ceased, and this was considered the true and unique expression of the spiritual and divine life. This is what was considered divine grace, divine succor, divine intervention. And even now, in this age of anguish, tension and hypertension, this sovereign peace is of all help the best received, the most welcome, the relief asked and hoped for. For many, it is still the true sign of divine intervention, of divine grace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-741">In fact, no matter what you wish to realize, you must begin by establishing this perfect and immutable peace ‚Äì it is the necessary basis for any work; but unless you are thinking of an exclusive or personal and egoistic liberation, you cannot stop there. There is yet another aspect to the divine grace, the aspect of progress that will be victorious over all obstacles, the aspect that will propel humanity into a new realization, open the doors unto a new world, enable not only a select few to benefit from the divine realization, but through their influence, their example and their power, bring a new and better condition to the rest of humanity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-742">It opens vistas of realization into the future and already foreseen possibilities through which an entire section of humanity, which</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page169">Page 169</p>
<p class="PE"> is consciously or unconsciously open to the new forces, will be lifted up, as it were, towards a higher, more harmonious, more perfect life... and even if individual transformations are not permissible nor possible in all cases, at least there will be a kind of uplifting of the whole, a harmonization of everything, enabling a new order, a new harmony to be established and the anguish of disorder and the present strife to disappear and be replaced by an order that will allow for the harmonious working of the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-743">There will be other consequences that by opposite means will tend to eradicate the perversion and ugliness created in life due to the intervention of the mind, a whole range of deformations that have aggravated suffering, misery, moral poverty, a whole zone of sordid and repugnant miseries that makes an entire portion of human life so hideous. That must disappear. That is what in many respects makes humanity infinitely inferior to animal life, with its simplicity and its natural spontaneity, and which in spite of everything is harmonious. Suffering among animals is never as miserable and sordid as it is in a whole section of humanity perverted by a mentality exclusively turned towards egoistic needs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-744">One must rise above, surge forth into the Light and the Harmony, or sink back down into the simplicity of a wholesome, unperverted animal life.</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>(After a moment of silence, Mother adds)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-745">But those who cannot be lifted up, who refuse to progress, will automatically lose the use of the mental consciousness and fall back into an infrahuman stage.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-746">I'll tell you of an experience I had which will help you better understand. It was a short while after the supramental experience of February 3, and I was still in that state where things of the physical world seemed so remote, so absurd. A group of visitors asked permission to greet me, and they came one evening to the playground. They were rich people ‚Äì that is, they had more money than they needed to live. Among them was a woman in a saree. She was very fat, and her saree was so arranged as to hide her body. When she bent over to receive my blessings, a corner of her saree fell open, uncovering part of her body, a bare belly. An enormous belly. It came as a shock to me... There are obese people who are not at all repugnant, but there I suddenly saw the perversion, the rottenness that this abdomen concealed. It was like an enormous abscess expressing greed, vice, depravity of taste, sordid</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page170">Page 170</p>
<p class="PE"> desire that seeks satisfaction as no animal would, grossly, and above all, perversely. I saw the perversion of a depraved mind placed at the service of the basest appetites. Then, in a flash, something leapt forth from me, a prayer, like a Veda: ‚ÄúO Lord, it is this that must vanish!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-747">One can well understand that physical misery or the unequal distribution of the world's wealth could be remedied. One can think of economic and social solutions that could remedy all that, but this particular misery, this mental misery, this vital perversion ‚Äì it is this that cannot change, that does <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT WANT</span> to change. And those who belong to this kind of humanity are condemned in advance to disintegration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-748">The meaning of original sin is precisely this: the perversion that began with the mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-749">That part of humanity, of the human consciousness, which is able to unite with the Supermind and liberate itself will be completely transformed. It is moving towards its future reality as yet unexpressed in the outer form; the part very close to the simplicity of the animal, close to Nature, will be reabsorbed by Nature and thoroughly reassimilated. But that corrupted part of the human consciousness, which through its wrong use of the mind allows this perversion, will be abolished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-750">That kind of humanity belongs to an unfruitful attempt ‚Äì and will be eliminated, like so many other abortive species which have vanished in the course of universal history.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-751">Certain prophets in the past had this apocalyptic vision, but as usual things became mixed, and along with their vision of the apocalypse they did not have the vision of the supramental world that will come to uplift the consenting part of humanity and transform this physical world. However, to give hope to those born into this perverted part of the human consciousness, redemption through faith was taught: those who have faith in the sacrifice of the Divine in Matter will automatically be saved, in another world ‚Äì faith alone, without understanding, without intelligence. They never saw the supramental world, nor did they see that the great Sacrifice of the Divine in Matter is that of an involution which will lead to the total revelation of the Divine in Matter itself.</p>

<p class="PE"> A subject for this evening...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-756">Something I have never said completely. On the one hand, there is the attitude of those in yesterday evening's film:<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="57" href="#">2</a> God is everything, God is everywhere, God is in he who smites you (as Sri Aurobindo wrote ‚Äì ‚ÄúGod made me good with a blow, shall I tell Him: O Mighty One, I forgive you your harm and cruelty but do not do it again!‚Äù), an attitude which, if extended to its ultimate conclusion, accepts the world as it is: the world is the perfect expression of the divine Will. On the other hand, there is the attitude of progress and transformation. But for that, you must recognize that there are things in the world which are not as they should be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-757">In <em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>, Sri Aurobindo says that this idea of good and bad, of pure and impure, is a notion needed for action; but the purists, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna and others, do not agree. They do not agree that it is indispensable for action. They simply say: your acceptance of action as a necessary thing is contrary to your perception of the Divine in all things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-758"><em>How can the two be reconciled?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-759">I recall that once I tried to speak of this, but no one followed me, no one understood, so I did not insist. I left it open and never pursued it further, for they could not decipher anything or find any meaning in what I was saying. But now I could give a very simple answer: Let the Supreme do the work. It is He who has to progress, not you!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-760"><em>Ramdas does not at all consider that the world as it is, is good.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-761">No, but I know all these people, I know them thoroughly! I know Chaitanya, Ramakrishna and Ramdas thoroughly. They are utterly familiar to me. It doesn't bother them. These are people who live with a certain feeling, who have an entirely concrete experience and live in this experience, but they don't care at all if their formation ‚Äì they have not even crystallized it, they leave it like that, vague ‚Äì contains things that are mutually contradictory, because, in appearance, they reconcile them. They do not raise any questions, they do not have the need for an absolutely clear vision; their feeling is absolutely clear, and that's enough for them.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-771">This morning I asked myself the question, ‚Äúis money truly under Nature's control?‚Äù I shall have to see... Because for me personally, she always gives everything in abundance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-772">When I was young, I was as poor as a turkey, as poor as could be! As an artist, I sometimes had to go out in society (as artists are forced to do). I had lacquered boots that were cracked... and I painted them so it wouldn't show! This is to tell you the state I was in ‚Äì poor as a turkey. So one day, in a shop window, I saw a very pretty petticoat much in fashion then, with lace, ribbons, etc. (It was the fashion in those days to have long skirts which trailed on the floor, and I didn't have a petticoat which could go with such things ‚Äì I didn't care, it didn't matter to me in the least, but since Nature had told me I would always have everything I needed, I wanted to make an experiment.) So I said, ‚ÄúWell, I would very much like to have a petticoat to go with those skirts.‚Äù I got five of them! They came from every direction!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-773">And it is always like that. I never ask for anything, but if by chance I say to myself, ‚ÄúHmm, wouldn't it be nice to have that,‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page175">Page 175</p>
<p class="PE"> mountains of them pour in! So last year, I made an experiment, I told Nature, ‚ÄúListen, my little one, you say that you will collaborate, you told me I would never lack anything. Well then, to put it on a level of feelings, it would really be fun, it would give me joy (in the style of Krishna's joy), to have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">A LOT</span> of money to do everything I feel like doing. It's not that I want to increase things for myself, no; you give me more than I need. But to have some fun, to be able to give freely, to do things freely, to spend freely ‚Äì I am asking you to give me a crore of rupees<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="59" href="#">1</a> for my birthday!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-774">She didn't do a thing! Nothing, absolutely nothing: a complete refusal. Did she refuse or was she unable to? It may be that... I always saw that money was under the control of an asuric force. (I am speaking of currency, ‚Äúcash‚Äù; I don't want to do business. When I try to do business, it generally succeeds very well, but I don't mean that. I am speaking of cash.) I never asked her that question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-775">You see, this is how it happened: there's this Ganesh<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="60" href="#">2</a>... We had a meditation (this was more than thirty years ago) in the room where ‚ÄúProsperity‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="61" href="#">3</a> is now distributed. There were eight or ten of us, I believe. We used to make sentences with flowers; I arranged the flowers, and each one made a sentence with the different flowers I had put there. And one day when the subject of prosperity or wealth came up, I thought (they always say that Ganesh is the god of money, of fortune, of the world's wealth), I thought, ‚ÄúIsn't this whole story of the god with an elephant trunk merely a lot of human imagination?‚Äù Thereupon, we meditated. And who should I see walk in and park himself in front of me but a living being, absolutely alive and luminous, with a trunk that long... and smiling! So then, in my meditation, I said, ‚ÄúAh! So it's true that you exist!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúOf course I exist! And you may ask me for whatever you wish, from a monetary standpoint, of course, and I will give it to you!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-776">So I asked. And for about ten years, it poured in, like this <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture of torrents)</em></span>. It was incredible. I would ask, and at the next Darshan, or a month or several days later, depending, there it was.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-777">Then the war and all the difficulties came, bringing a tremendous increase of people and expenditure (the war cost a fortune ‚Äì</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page176">Page 176</p>anything at all cost ten times more than before), and suddenly, finished, nothing more. Not exactly nothing, but a thin little trickle. And when I asked, it didn't come. So one day, I put the question to Ganesh through his image (!), I asked him, ‚ÄúWhat about your promise?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúI can't do it, it's too much for me; my means are too limited!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I said to myself <span class="note_1"><em>(laughing)</em></span>, ‚ÄúWhat bad luck!‚Äù And I no longer counted on him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-778">Once someone even asked Santa Claus! A young Muslim girl who had a special liking for ‚ÄúFather Christmas‚Äù ‚Äì I don't know why, as it was not part of her religion! Without saying a word to me, she called on Santa Claus and told him, ‚ÄúMother doesn't believe in you; you should give Her a gift to prove to Her that you exist. You can give it to Her for Christmas.‚Äù And it happened!... She was quite proud.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-779">But it only happened like that once. And as for Ganesh, that was the end of it. So then I asked Nature. It took her a long time to accept to collaborate. But as for the money, I shall have to ask her about it; because for me personally, it is still going on. I think, ‚ÄúHmm, wouldn't it be nice to have a wristwatch like that.‚Äù And I get twenty of them! I say to myself, ‚ÄúWell, if I had that...‚Äù and I get thirty of them! Things come in from every side, without my even uttering a word ‚Äì I don't even ask, they just come.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-780">The first time I came here and spoke with Sri Aurobindo about what was needed for the Work, he told me (he also wrote it to me) that for the secure achievement of the Work we would need three powers: one was the power over health, the second was the power over government, and the third was the power over money.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-781">Health naturally depends upon the sadhana; but even that is not so sure: there are other factors. As for the second, the power over government, Sri Aurobindo looked at it, studied it, considered it very carefully, and finally he told me, ‚ÄúThere is only one way to have that power: it is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TO BE</span> the government. One can influence individuals, one can transmit the will to them, but their hands are tied. In a government, there is no one individual, nor even several, who is all-powerful and who can decide things. One must be the government oneself and give it the desired orientation.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-782">For the last, for money, he told me, ‚ÄúI still don't know exactly what it depends on.‚Äù Then one day I entered into trance with this idea in mind, and after a certain journey I came to a place like a subterranean grotto (which means that it is in the subconscient, or perhaps even in the inconscient) which was the source, the place and the power over money. I was about to enter into this grotto (a</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page177">Page 177</p>
<p class="PE"> kind of inner cave) when I saw, coiled and upright, an immense serpent, like an all black python, formidable, as big as a seven-story house, who said, ‚ÄúYou cannot pass!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhy not? Let me pass!‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúMyself, I would let you pass, but if I did, ‚Äòthey‚Äô would immediately destroy me.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúWho, then, is this ‚Äòthey‚Äô?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúThey are the asuric<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="62" href="#">4</a> powers who rule over money. They have put me here to guard the entrance, precisely so that you may not enter.‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúAnd what is it that would give one the power to enter?‚Äù Then he told me something like this: ‚ÄúI heard (that is, he himself had no special knowledge, but it was something he had heard from his masters, those who ruled over him), I heard that he who will have a total power over the human sexual impulses (not merely in himself, but a universal power ‚Äì that is, a power enabling him to control this everywhere, among all men) will have the right to enter.‚Äù In other words, these forces would not be able to prevent him from entering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-783">A personal realization is very easy, it is nothing at all; a personal realization is one thing, but the power to control it among all men ‚Äì that is, to control or master such movements at will, everywhere ‚Äì is quite another. I don't believe that this... condition has been fulfilled. If what the serpent said is true and if this is really what will vanquish these hostile forces that rule over money, well then, it has not been fulfilled.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-784">It has been fulfilled to a certain extent ‚Äì but it's negligible. It is conditional, limited: in one case, it works; in another, it doesn't. It is quite problematic. And naturally, where terrestrial things are involved (I don't say universal, but in any case terrestrial), when it is something involving the earth, it must be complete; there cannot be any approximations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-785">Therefore, it's an affair between the asuras and the human species. To transform itself is the only solution left to the human species ‚Äì in other words, to tear from the asuric forces the power of ruling over the human species.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-786">You see, the human species is a part of Nature, but as Sri Aurobindo has explained, from the moment mind expressed itself in man, it put him into a relationship with Nature very different from the relationship all the lower species have with her. All the lower species right up to man are completely under the rule of Nature; she makes them do whatever she wants, and they can do nothing without her consent. Whereas man begins to act and to live as an equal; not as an equal in terms of power, but from the</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page178">Page 178</p>
<p class="PE"> standpoint of consciousness (he is beginning to do so since he has the capacity to study and to find out Nature's secrets). He is not superior to her, far from it, but he is on an equal footing. And so he has acquired ‚Äì this is a fact ‚Äì he has acquired a certain power of independence that he immediately used to put himself under the influence of the hostile forces, which are not terrestrial but extra-terrestrial.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-787">I am speaking of terrestrial Nature. Through their mental power, men had the choice and the freedom to make pacts with these extraterrestrial vital forces. There is a whole vital world that has nothing to do with the earth, it is entirely independent or prior to earth's existence, it is self-existent ‚Äì well, they have brought that down here! They have made... what we see! And such being the case... This is what terrestrial Nature told me: ‚ÄúIt is beyond my control.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-788">So considering all that, Sri Aurobindo came to the conclusion that only the supramental power... <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother brings down her hands)</em></span> as he said, will be able to rule over everything. And when that happens, it will be all over ‚Äì including Nature. For a long time, Nature rebelled (I have written about it often). She used to say, ‚ÄúWhy are you in such a hurry? It will be done one day.‚Äù But then last year, there was that extraordinary experience.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="63" href="#">5</a> And it was because of that experience that I told her, ‚ÄúWell, now that we agree, give me some proof; I am asking you for some proof ‚Äì do it for me.‚Äù She didn't budge, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-789">Perhaps it is a kind of... it can hardly be called an intuition, but a kind of divination of this idea that made people speak of ‚Äúselling one's soul to the devil for money,‚Äù of money being an evil force, which produces this shrinking on the part of all those who want to lead a spiritual life ‚Äì but as for that, they shrink from everything, not only from money!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-790">Perhaps it would not be necessary to have this power over all men, but in any event, it should be great enough to act upon the mass. It is likely that once a certain movement has been mastered to some degree, what the mass does or doesn't do (this whole human mass that has barely, barely emerged into even the mental consciousness) will become quite irrelevant. You see, the mass is still under the great rule of Nature. I am referring to mental humanity, predominantly mental, which developed the mind but misused it and immediately set out on the wrong path ‚Äì first thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-791">There is nothing to say since the first thing done by the divine</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page179">Page 179</p>
<p class="PE"> forces which emanated for the Creation was to take the wrong path!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="64" href="#">6</a> That is the origin, the seed of this marvelous spirit of independence ‚Äì the negation of <em>surrender</em>, in other words. Man said, ‚ÄúI have the power to think; I will do with it what I want, and no one has the right to intervene. I am free, I am an independent being, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN-DE-PEN-DENT!‚Äù</span> So that's how things stand: we are all independent beings!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-792">But yesterday, in fact, I was looking (with all these mantras and these prayers and this whole vibration that has descended into the atmosphere, creating a state of constant calling in the atmosphere), and I remembered the old movements and how everything now has changed! I was also thinking of the old disciplines, one of which is to say, ‚ÄúI am That.‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="65" href="#">7</a> People were told to sit in meditation and repeat, ‚ÄúI am That,‚Äù to reach an identification. And it all seemed to me so obsolete, so childish, but at the same time a part of the whole. I looked, and it seemed so absurd to sit in meditation and say, ‚ÄúI am That‚Äù! ‚ÄúI,‚Äù what is this ‚ÄúI‚Äù who is That; what is this ‚ÄúI,‚Äù where is it?... I was trying to find it, and I saw a tiny, microscopic point (to see it would almost require some gigantic instrument), a tiny, obscure point in an im-men-sity of Light, and that little point was the body. At the same time ‚Äì it was absolutely simultaneous ‚Äì I saw the Presence of the Supreme as a very, very, very, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> immense Being, within which was ‚ÄúI‚Äù in an attitude of... (‚ÄúI‚Äù was only a sensation, you see), an attitude... <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture of surrender)</em></span> like this. There were no limits, yet at the same time, one felt the joy of being permeated, enveloped and of being able to widen, widen, widen indefinitely ‚Äì to widen the whole being, from the highest consciousness to the most material consciousness. And then, at the same time, to look at this body and to see every cell, every atom vibrating with a divine, radiant Presence with all its Consciousness, all its Power, all its Will, all its Love ‚Äì all, all, really ‚Äì and a joy! An extraordinary joy. And one did not disturb the other, nothing was contradictory and everything was felt at the same time. That was when I said, ‚ÄúBut truly! This body had to have the training it has had for more than seventy years to be able to bear all that without starting to cry out or dance or leap up or whatever it might be!‚Äù No, it was</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page180">Page 180</p>
<p class="PE"> calm (it was exultant, but it was very calm), and it remained in control of its movements and its words. In spite of the fact that it was really living in another world, it could apparently act normal due to this strenuous training in self-control by the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">REASON</span> ‚Äì by the reason ‚Äì over the whole being, which has tamed it and given it such a great cohesive power that I can <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BE</span> in the experience, I can <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVE</span> this experience, and at the same time respond with the most amiable of smiles to the most idiotic questions!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-793">And then, it always ends in the same way, by a canticle to the action of the grace: ‚ÄúO, Lord! You are truly marvelous! All the experiences I have needed to pass through You have given to me, all the things I needed to do to make this body ready You have made me do, and always with the feeling that it was You who was making me do it‚Äù ‚Äì and with the universal disapproval of all the right-minded humanity!</p>

So according to the human mode, it is obvious that man is much more conscious than the animal, but the human brings in sin and perversion which do not exist outside of this state we call ‚Äúconscious‚Äù ‚Äì which in fact is not conscious but merely consists in mentalizing things and in having the ability to objectify them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-811">It is an ascending curve, but a curve that swerves away from the Divine. So naturally, one has to climb much higher to find a higher Divine, since it is a conscious Divine, whereas the others are divine spontaneously and instinctively, without being conscious of it. All our moral notions of good and evil, all of that, are what we have thrown over the creation with our distorted and perverted consciousness. It is we who have invented it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-864">I have a whole stock of mantras; they have all come spontaneously, never from the head. They sprang forth spontaneously, as the Veda is said to have sprung forth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-865">I don't know when it began ‚Äì a very long time ago, before I came here, although some of them came while I was here. But in my case, they were always very short. For example, when Sri Aurobindo was here in his body, at any moment, in any difficulty, for anything, it always came like this: ‚ÄúMy Lord!‚Äù ‚Äì simply and spontaneously ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Lord!‚Äù And instantly, the contact was established. But since He left, it has stopped. I can no longer say it, for it would be like saying ‚ÄúMy Lord, My Lord!‚Äù to myself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-866">I had a mantra in French before coming to Pondicherry. It was <em>Dieu de bont√© et de mis√©ricorde... [God</em> of kindness and mercy], but what it means is usually not understood ‚Äì it is an entire program, a universal program. I have been repeating this mantra since the beginning of the century; it was the mantra of ascension, of realization. At present, it no longer comes in the same way, it comes rather as a memory. But it was deliberate, you see; I always said <em>Dieu de bont√© et de mis√©ricorde</em>, because even then I understood that everything is the Divine and the Divine is in all things and that it is only we who make a distinction between what is or what is not the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-867">My experience is that, individually, we are in relationship with that aspect of the Divine which is not necessarily the most in conformity with our natures, but which is the most essential for our development or the most necessary for our action. For me, it was always a question of action because, personally, individually, each aspiration for personal development had its own form, its own spontaneous expression, so I did not use any formula. But as soon as there was the least little difficulty in action, it sprang forth. Only long afterwards did I notice that it was formulated in a certain way ‚Äì I would utter it without even knowing what the words were. But it came like this: <em>Dieu de bont√© et de mis√©ricorde</em>. It was as if I wanted to eliminate from action all aspects that were not this one. And it lasted for... I don't know, more than twenty or twenty-five years of my life. It came spontaneously.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page193">Page 193</p>
<p class="PE">Just recently one day, the contact became entirely physical, the whole body was in great exaltation, and I noticed that other lines were spontaneously being added to this <em>Dieu de bont√© et de mis√©ricorde</em>, and I noted them down.

As soon as I finished writing (in writing, all this becomes rather flat), the impetus within was still alive and it gave me the sense of an all-conquering Truth. And the last mantra sprang forth:</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-900">But when I have this mantra, I believe something will happen.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-901">For the moment, of all the formulas or mantras, the one that acts most directly on this body, that seizes all the cells and immediately does this <span class="note_1"><em>(vibrating motion)</em></span> 
is the Sanskrit mantra: OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-902">As soon as I sit for meditation, as soon as I have a quiet minute to concentrate, it always begins with this mantra, and there is a response in the body, in the cells of the body: they all start vibrating.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page195">Page 195</p>
<p class="PE"> This is how it happened: Y had just returned, and he brought back a trunk full of things which he then proceeded to show me, and his excitement made tight, tight little waves in the atmosphere, making my head ache; it made... anyway, it was unpleasant. When I left, just after that had happened, I sat down and went like this <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture of sweeping out)</em></span> to make it stop, and immediately the mantra began.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-903">It rose up from here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the solar plexus)</em></span>, like this: Om Namo Bhagavateh <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH</span>. It was formidable. For the entire quarter of an hour that the meditation lasted, everything was filled with Light! In the deeper tones it was of golden bronze (at the throat level it was almost red) and in the higher tones it was a kind of opaline white light: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH, OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH, OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-904">The other day (I was in my bathroom upstairs), it came; it took hold of the entire body. It rose up in the same way, and all the cells were trembling. And with such a power! So I stopped everything, all movement, and I let the thing grow. The vibration went on expanding, ever widening, as the sound itself was expanding, expanding, and all the cells of the body were seized with an intensity of aspiration... as if the entire body were swelling ‚Äì it became overwhelming. I felt that it would all burst.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-905">I understood those who withdraw from everything to live that totally.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-906">And it has such a transformative power! I felt that if it continued, something would happen, something like a change in the equilibrium of the body's cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-907">Unfortunately, I was unable to continue, because... I don't have the time; it was just before the balcony darshan and I was going to be late. Something told me, ‚ÄúThat is for people who have nothing to do.‚Äù Then I said, ‚ÄúI belong to my work,‚Äù and I slowly withdrew. I put on the brakes, and the action was cut short. But what remains is that whenever I repeat this mantra... everything starts vibrating.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-908">So each one must find something that acts on himself, individually. I am only speaking of the action on the physical plane, because mentally, vitally, in all the inner parts of the being, the aspiration is always, always spontaneous. I am referring only to the physical plane.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-909">The physical seems to be more open to something that is repetitious ‚Äì for example, the music we play on Sundays, which</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page196">Page 196</p>
<p class="PE"> has three series of combined mantras. The first is that of Chandi, addressed to the universal Mother:</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Ya devi sarvabhuteshu matrirupena sansthita</em></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Ya devi sarvabhuteshu shaktirupena sansthita</em></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Ya devi sarvabhuteshu shantirupena sansthita</em></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namo namah</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-910">The second is addressed to Sri Aurobindo (and I believe they have put my name at the end). It incorporates the mantra I was speaking of:</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Om namo namah shrimirambikayai</em></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Om namo bhagavateh shriaravindaya</em></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Om namo namah shrimirambikayai.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-911">And the third is addressed to Sri Aurobindo: ‚ÄúThou art my refuge.‚Äù</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Shriaravindah sharanam mama</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-912">Each time this music is played, it produces exactly the same effect upon the body. It is strange, as if all the cells were dilating, with a feeling that the body is growing larger... It becomes all dilated, as if swollen with light ‚Äì with force, a lot of force. And this music seems to form spirals, like luminous ribbons of incense smoke, white (not transparent, literally white) and they rise up and up. I always see the same thing; it begins in the form of a vase, then swells like an amphora and converges higher up to blossom forth like a flower.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-913">So for these mantras, everything depends upon what you want to do with them. I am in favor of a short mantra, especially if you want to make both numerous and spontaneous repetitions ‚Äì one or two words, three at most. Because you must be able to use them in all cases, when an accident is about to happen, for example. It has to spring up without thinking, without calling: it should issue forth from the being spontaneously, like a reflex, exactly like a reflex. Then the mantra has its full force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-914">For me, on the days when I have no special preoccupations or difficulties (days I could call normal, when I am normal), everything I do, all the movements of this body, all, all the words I utter, all the gestures I make, are accompanied and upheld by or lined, as it were, with this mantra:</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page197">Page 197</p>
<p class="PE"> <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH... OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH</span>...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-915">all, all the time, all the time, all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-916">That is the normal state. It creates an atmosphere of an intensity almost more material than the subtle physical; it's like... almost like the phosphorescent radiations from a medium. And it has a great action, a very great action: it can prevent an accident. And it accompanies you all the time, all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-917">But it is up to you to know what you want to do with it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-918"><em>To sustain the aspiration ‚Äì to remember. We so easily lapse into forgetfulness. To create a kind of automatism.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-921">That's why it should spring forth from you.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-922">This one, this mantra, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OM NAMO BHAGAVATEH</span>, came to me after some time, for I felt... well, I saw that I needed to have a mantra of my own, that is, a mantra consonant with what this body has to do in the world.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-927">It must be strong enough to pull me from my concentration or my activity. If I knew when you concentrate or do your <em>puja</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="78" href="#">1</a> I could tune into you, and 
then I would know more; otherwise, my inner life is too... I am not at all passive inwardly, you see, I am very active, so I don't usually receive your vibrations unless they impose themselves strongly or unless I have decided beforehand to be attentive to what is coming from someone or other. If I know that at a given moment something is going to happen, then I open a door, as it were. But it's difficult to speak of these things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-928">When you left on your journey,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="79" href="#">2</a> for example, I made a special concentration for all to go well so that nothing untoward happen to you. I even made a formation and asked for a constant, special help over you. Then I renewed my concentration every day, which is how I came to notice that you were invoking me very regularly. I 
saw you everyday, everyday, with a very regular precision. It was something that imposed itself on me, but it imposed itself only because I had initially made a formation to follow you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-929">For people here in the Ashram, my work is not the same. It is more like a kind of atmosphere that extends everywhere ‚Äì a very conscious atmosphere ‚Äì which I let work for each one according to his need. I don't have a special action for each person, unless something requires my special attention. When I would tune into you while you were travelling, I clearly saw your image appear before me, as though you were looking at me, but now that you have returned here, I no longer see it. Rather, I receive a sensation or an impression; and as these sensations and impressions are innumerable, it's rather like one element among many. It no longer imposes itself in such an entirely distinct way nor does</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-930">As soon as I am alone, I enter into a very deep concentration, ‚Äì a state of consciousness, a kind of universal activity. Is it deep? What is it?... It is far beyond all the mental regions, far, far beyond, and it is constant. As soon as I am alone or resting somewhere, that's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-931">The other day when I was in this state of concentration, I had the vision that I mentioned to you. I felt I was being pulled, that something was pulling me and trying to draw my attention. I felt it very strongly. So I opened my eyes, my mental eyes (the physical eyes may remain opened or closed, it makes no difference either way; when I am concentrated, things on the physical plane no longer exist), I deliberately opened the mind's eyes, for that is where I felt myself being pulled, and then I had this vision I told you of. Someone was trying to draw my attention, to tell me something. It takes someone really quite powerful, with a very great power of concentration, to do that ‚Äì there are certainly a great many people here and elsewhere who try to do this, yet I don't feel a thing.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="80" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-932">In the outer, practical domain, I might suddenly think of someone, so I know that this person is calling or thinking of me. When you left on your trip, I created a special link-up so that if ever, at any moment, you called me for anything, I would know it instantly, and I remained attentive and alert. But I do that only in exceptional cases. Generally speaking, when I haven't made this special link-up, things keep coming in and coming in and coming in and coming in, and the answer goes out automatically, here or there or there or there ‚Äì hundreds and hundreds of things that I don't keep in my memory because then it would really be frightful. I don't keep these things in my consciousness; it is rather a work that is done automatically.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-933">When you asked me if X<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="81" href="#">4</a> were thinking of me, I consulted my atmosphere and saw that it was true, that even many times a day X's thoughts were coming. So I know that he is concentrating on me, or something: it simply passes through me, and I answer automatically. But I don't particularly pay attention to X, unless</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page201">Page 201</p>
<p class="PE"> you ask me a question about him, in which case I deliberately tune into him, then observe and determine whether it's like this or like that. Whereas this vision the other day was something that thrust itself on me; I was in another region altogether, in my inner contemplation, my concentration ‚Äì a very strong concentration ‚Äì when I was forced to enter into contact with this being whose vision I had and who was obviously a very powerful being. After telling me what he had to tell me, he went away in a very peculiar way, not at all suddenly as most people appear and disappear, not at all like that. When I first saw him, there was a living form ‚Äì the being himself was there ‚Äì but upon leaving (probably to see the effect, to find out whether he had truly succeeded in making himself understood), he left behind a kind of image of himself. Afterwards, this image blurred and it left only a silhouette, an outline, then it disappeared altogether leaving only an impression. That was the last thing I saw. So I kept the impression and analyzed it to find out exactly what was involved; all this was filed away, and then it was over. I began my concentration once again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-934">I intentionally carry everybody in my active consciousness for the work, and I do the work consciously; but the extent to which people in the world, or those who are here in the Ashram, are conscious of this or receive the results depends upon them, though not exclusively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-935">The other day, for example, though I no longer recall exactly when (I forget everything on purpose) ‚Äì but it was in the last part of the night ‚Äì I had a rather long activity concerning the whole realization of the Ashram, notably in the fields of education and art. I was apparently inspecting this area to see how things were there, so naturally I saw a certain number of people, their work and their inner states. Some saw me and, at that moment, had a vision of me. It is likely that many were asleep and didn't notice anything, but some actually saw me. The next morning, for example, someone who works at the theater told me that she had had a splendid vision of me in which I had spoken to her, blessed her, etc. This was her way of receiving the work I had done. And this kind of thing is happening more and more, in that my action is awakening the consciousness in others more and more strongly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-936">Naturally, the reception is always incomplete or partially modified; when it passes through the individuality, it becomes narrowed, a personal thing. It seems impossible for each one to have a consciousness vast enough to see the thing in its entirety.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-937"><em> You said that our way of receiving your work or becoming conscious of it does not ‚Äúexclusively‚Äù depend upon us. What do you mean?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-938">It depends upon the progress in the consciousness. The more the action is supramentalized, the more its reception is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IMPOSED</span> upon the consciousness of each one. The action's progress makes it more and more perceptible <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN SPITE OF</span> each one's condition. The milieu obviously limits and alters ‚Äì distorts ‚Äì what it receives, but the quality of the Work acts upon this receptivity and imposes itself on it in a more and more efficient and imperious way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-939">There is an interdependence between the individual progress and the collective progress, between that which works and that which is worked upon. It proceeds like this <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture of intermeshing)</em></span>, and as one progresses, the other progresses. The progress above not only hastens the progress below but brings the two nearer together, thus changing the distance in the relationship; that is, the distance will not remain the same, the ratio between the progress here and the progress above won't always be identical.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-940">The progress above follows a certain trajectory, and in some cases the distance increases, in others it decreases (although on the whole, the distance remains relatively unchanged), but my feeling is that the collective receptivity will increase as the action becomes increasingly supramentalized. And the need for an individual receptivity ‚Äì with all its distortions and alterations and limitations ‚Äì will decrease in importance as the supramental influence increasingly imposes its power. This influence will impose itself in such a way that it will no longer be subject to the defects in receptivity.</p>

And at that moment, the feeling of this infinite power that has no limit, that nothing can limit, was so overwhelming that all the functions of the body, of this mental machine that summons up words, all this was... I could no longer speak French. Perhaps the words could have come to me in English ‚Äì probably, because it was easier for Sri Aurobindo to express himself in English, and that's how it must have happened: it was the part embodied in Sri Aurobindo (the part of the Supreme that was embodied in Sri Aurobindo for its manifestation) that had the experience. This is what joined back with the Origin and caused the experience ‚Äì I was well aware of it. And that is probably why its transcription through English words would have been easier than through French words (for at these moments, such activities are purely mechanical, rather like automatic machines). And naturally the experience left something behind. It left the sense of a power that can no longer be ‚Äúqualified,‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="82" href="#">5</a> really.

For example, the volume of Force that was to be expressed in the voice was too great for the speech organ. So I had to be a little attentive ‚Äì that is, there had to be a kind of filtering in the outermost expression, otherwise the voice would have cracked. But this isn't done through the will and reason, it's automatic. Yet I feel that... the capacity of Matter to contain and express is increasing with phenomenal speed. But it's progressive, it can't be done instantly. There have often been people whose outer form broke because the Force was too strong; well, I clearly see that it is being dosed out. After all, this is exclusively the concern of the Supreme Lord, I don't bother about it ‚Äì it's not my concern and I don't bother about it ‚Äì He makes the necessary adjustments. Thus it comes progressively, little by little, so that no fundamental disequilibrium occurs. It gives the impression that one's head is swelling so tremendously it will burst!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-947">But how many people know how to use it in this way? Very few, which is why they have to be taught. What I call ‚Äúteach‚Äù is to show, to give the example. We want to be the example of true living in the world. It's a challenge I am placing before the whole financial world: I am telling them that they are in the process of withering and ruining the earth with their idiotic system; and with even less than they are now spending for useless things ‚Äì merely for inflating something that has no inherent life, that should be only an instrument at the service of life, that has no reality in itself, that is only a means and not an end (they make an end of something that is only a means) ‚Äì well then, instead of making of it an end, they should make it the means. With what they have at their disposal they could... oh, transform the earth so quickly! Transform it, put it into contact, truly into contact, with the supramental forces that would make life bountiful and, indeed, constantly renewed ‚Äì instead of becoming withered, stagnant, shrivelled up: a future moon. A dead moon.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-948">We are told that in a few millions or billions of years, the earth will become some kind of moon. The movement should be the opposite: the earth should become more and more a resplendent sun, but a sun of life. Not a sun that burns, but a sun that illumines ‚Äì a radiant glory.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(The disciple asks to know what he must do and what his place is in the universal manifestation)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-961">In all religious and especially occult initiations, the ritual of the different ceremonies is prescribed in every detail; all the words pronounced, all the gestures made have their importance, and the least infraction of the rule, the least fault committed can have fatal consequences. It is the same in material life ‚Äì if one had the initiation into the true way of living, one could transform physical existence.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page208">Page 208</p>
<p class="PE"> If we consider the body as the tabernacle of the Lord, then medical science, for example, becomes the initiatory ritual of the service of the temple, and doctors of all kinds are the officiating priests in the different rituals of worship. Thus, medicine is really a priesthood and should be treated as such.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-962">The same can be said of physical culture and of all the sciences that are concerned with the body and its workings. If the material universe is considered as the outer sheath and the manifestation of the Supreme, then it can generally be said that all the physical sciences are the rituals of worship.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-963">We always come back to the same thing: the absolute necessity for perfect sincerity, perfect honesty and a sense of the dignity of all we do so that we may do it as it should be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-964">If we could truly, perfectly know all the details of the ceremony of life, the worship of the Lord in physical life, it would be wonderful ‚Äì to know, and no longer to err, never again to err. To perform the ceremony as perfectly as an initiation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-965">To know life utterly... Oh, there is a very interesting thing in this regard! And it's strange, but this particular knowledge reminds me of one of my Sutras<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="84" href="#">1</a> (which I read out, but no one understood or understood only vaguely, ‚Äúlike that‚Äù):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-966">‚ÄúIt is the Supreme Lord who has ineluctably decreed the place you occupy in the universal concert, but whatever be this place, you have equally the same right as all others to ascend the supreme summits right to the supramental realization.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-967">There is one's position in the universal hierarchy, which is something ineluctable ‚Äì it is the eternal law ‚Äì and there is the development in the manifestation, which is an education; it is progressive and done from within the being. What is remarkable is that to become a perfect being, this position ‚Äì whatever it is, decreed since all eternity, a part of the eternal Truth ‚Äì must manifest with the greatest possible perfection as a result of evolutionary growth. It is the junction, the union of the two, the eternal position and the evolutionary realization, that will make the total and perfect being, and the manifestation as the Lord has willed it since the beginning of all eternity (which has no beginning at all!).</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page209">Page 209</p>
<p class="PE"> And for the cycle to be complete, one cannot stop on the way at any plane, not even the highest spiritual plane nor the plane closest to matter (like the occult plane in the vital, for example). One must descend right into matter, and this perfection in manifestation must be a material perfection, or otherwise the cycle is not complete ‚Äì which explains why those who want to flee in order to realize the divine Will are in error. What must be done is exactly the opposite! The two must be combined in a perfect way. This is why all the honest sciences, the sciences that are practiced sincerely, honestly, exclusively with a will to know, are difficult paths ‚Äì yet such sure paths for the total realization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-968">It brings up very interesting things. (What I am going to say now is very personal and consequently cannot be used, but it may be kept anyway:)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-969">There are two parallel things that, from the eternal and supreme point of view, are of identical importance, in that both are equally essential for the realization to be a true realization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-970">On the one hand, there is what Sri Aurobindo ‚Äì who, as the Avatar, represented the supreme Consciousness and Will on earth ‚Äì declared me to be, that is, the supreme universal Mother; and on the other hand, there is what I am realizing in my body through the integral sadhana.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">2</a> I could be the supreme Mother and not do any sadhana, and as a matter of fact, as long as Sri Aurobindo was in his body, it was he who did the sadhana, and I received the effects. These effects were automatically established in the outer being, but he was the one doing it, not I ‚Äì I was merely the bridge between his sadhana and the world. Only when he left his body was I forced to take up the sadhana myself; not only did I have to do what I was doing before ‚Äì being a bridge between his sadhana and the world ‚Äì but I had to carry on the sadhana myself. When he left, he turned over to me the responsibility for what he himself had been doing in his body, and I had to do it. So there are both these things. Sometimes one predominates, sometimes the other (I don't mean successively in time, but... it depends on the moment), and they are trying to combine in a total and perfect realization: the eternal, ineffable and immutable Consciousness of the Ex√©cutrice of the Supreme, and the consciousness of the Sadhak of the integral Yoga who strives in an ascending effort towards an ever increasing progression.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page210">Page 210</p>
<p class="PE"> To this has been added a growing initiation into the supramental realization which is (I understand it well now) the perfect union of what comes from above and what comes from below, or in other words, the eternal position and the evolutionary realization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-971">Then ‚Äì and this becomes rather amusing like life's play... Depending upon each one's nature and position and bias, and because human beings are very limited, very partial and incapable of a global vision, there are those who believe, who have faith, or to whom the eternal Mother is revealed through Grace, who have this kind of relationship with the eternal Mother ‚Äì and there are those who themselves are plunged in sadhana, who have the consciousness of a developed sadhak, and thereby have the same relationship with me as one has with what they generally call a ‚Äúrealized soul.‚Äù Such persons consider me the prototype of the Guru teaching a new way, but the others don't have this relationship of sadhak to Guru (I am taking the two extremes, but of course there are all the possibilities in between), they are only in contact with the eternal Mother and, in the simplicity of their hearts, they expect Her to do everything for them. If they were perfect in this attitude, the eternal Mother would do everything for them ‚Äì as a matter of fact, She does do everything, but as they aren't perfect, they cannot receive it totally. But the two paths are very different, the two kinds of relationships are very different; and as we all live according to the law of external things, in a material body, there is a kind of annoyance, an almost irritated misunderstanding, between those who follow this path (not consciously and intentionally, but spontaneously), who have this relationship of the child to the Mother, and those who have this other relationship of the sadhak to the Guru. So it creates a whole play, with an infinite diversity of shades.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-972">But all this is still in suspense, on the way to realization, moving forward progressively; therefore, unless we are able to see the outcome, we can't understand a thing. We get confused. Only when we see the outcome, the final realization, only when we have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TOUCHED</span> <em>there</em>, will everything be understood ‚Äì then it will be as clear and as simple as can be. But meanwhile, my relationships with different people are very funny, utterly amusing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-973">Those who have what I would call the more ‚Äúouter‚Äù relationship compared to the other (although it is not really so) ‚Äì the relationship of yoga, of sadhana ‚Äì consider the others superstitious; and the others, who have faith 
or perception, or the Grace to have</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page211">Page 211</p>
<p class="PE"> understood what Sri Aurobindo meant (perhaps even before knowing what he said, but in any event, after he said it), discard the others as ignorant unbelievers! And there are all the gradations in between, so it really becomes quite funny!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-974">It opens up extraordinary horizons; once you have understood this, you have the key ‚Äì you have the key to many, many things: the different positions of each of the different saints, the different realizations and... it resolves all the incoherencies of the various manifestations on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-975">For example, this question of Power ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> Power ‚Äì over Matter. Those who perceive me as the eternal, universal Mother and Sri Aurobindo as the Avatar are surprised that our power is not absolute. They are surprised that we have not merely to say, ‚ÄúLet it be thus‚Äù for it to be ‚Äúthus.‚Äù This is because, in the integral realization, the union of the two is essential: a union of the power that proceeds from the eternal position and the power that proceeds from the sadhana through evolutionary growth. Similarly, how is it that those who have reached even the summits of yogic knowledge (I was thinking of Swami) need to resort to beings like gods or demigods to be able to realize things? ‚Äì Because they have indeed united with certain higher forces and entities, but it was not decreed since the beginning of time that they were this particular being. They were not born as this or that, but through evolution they united with a latent possibility in themselves. Each one carries the Eternal within himself, but one can join Him only when one has realized the complete union of the latent Eternal with the eternal Eternal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-976">And... this explains everything, absolutely everything: how it works, how it functions in the world.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86" href="#">3</a> I was saying to myself, ‚ÄúBut I have no powers, I have no powers!‚Äù Several days ago, I said, ‚ÄúBut after all, I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW WHO</span> is there, I know, yet how is it that...? There, up to there <span class="note_1"><em>(the level of the head)</em></span>, it is all-powerful, nothing can resist ‚Äì but here... it is ineffective.‚Äù So those who have faith, even an ignorant but real faith (it can be ignorant but nevertheless it is real), say, ‚ÄúWhat! How can you have no powers?‚Äù... Because the sadhana is not yet over.</p>

Oh yes, the story begins like this: one of the three ‚Äì I believe it was Shiva's consort, Parvati (she was the worst one, by the way!) ‚Äì was doing her puja. Shiva was in meditation, and she began doing her puja in front of him; she was using an oil lamp for the puja, and the lamp fell down and burned her foot. She cried out because she had burned her foot. So Shiva at once came out of his meditation and said to her, ‚ÄúWhat is it, Devi?‚Äù <span class="note_1"><em>(laughter)</em></span> She answered, ‚ÄúI burned my foot!‚Äù Then Narada said, ‚ÄúAren't you ashamed of what you have done? ‚Äì to make Shiva come out of his meditation simply because you have a little burn on your foot, which cannot even hurt you since you are immortal!‚Äù She became furious and snapped at him, ‚ÄúShow me that it can be otherwise!‚Äù Narada replied, ‚ÄúI am going to show you what it is to really love one's husband ‚Äì you don't know anything about it!‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1015">In Europe and in the modern Western world, it is thought that all these gods ‚Äì the Greek gods and the ‚Äúpagan‚Äù gods, as they are called ‚Äì are human fancies, that they are not real beings. To understand, one must know that they are real beings. That is the difference. For Westerners, they are only a figment of the human imagination and don't correspond to anything real in the universe. But that is a gross mistake.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1016">To understand the workings of universal life, and even those of terrestrial life, one must know that in their own realms these are all living beings, each with his own independent reality. They would exist even if men did not exist! Most of these gods existed before man.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1017">They are beings who belong to the progressive creation of the universe and who have themselves presided over its formation from the most etheric or subtle regions to the most material regions. They are a descent of the divine creative Spirit that came to repair the <em>mischief</em>... in short, to repair what the Asuras had done. The first makers created disorder and darkness, an unconsciousness, and then it is said that there was a second ‚Äúlineage‚Äù of makers to repair that evil, and the gods gradually descended through realities that were ever more ‚Äì one can't say dense, because it isn't really dense, nor can one even say material, since matter as we know it does not exist on these planes ‚Äì through more and more concrete substances.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1018">All these zones, these planes of reality, received different names and were classified in different ways according to the occult schools, according to the different traditions, but there is an essential similarity, and if we go back far enough into the various traditions, hardly anything but words differ, depending upon the country and the language. The descriptions are quite similar. Moreover, those who climb back up the ladder ‚Äì or in other words, a human being who, through his occult knowledge, goes out of one of his ‚Äúbodies‚Äù (they are called <em>sheaths</em> in English) and enters into a more subtle body ‚Äì in order to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ACT</span> in a more subtle body ‚Äì and so forth, twelve times (you make each body come out</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page219">Page 219</p>
<p class="PE"> from a more material body, leaving the more material body in its corresponding zone, and then go off through successive exteriorizations), what they have seen, what they have discovered and seen through their ascension ‚Äì whether they are occultists from the Occident or occultists from the Orient ‚Äì is for the most part analogous in description. They have put different words on it, but the experience is very analogous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1019">There is the whole Chaldean tradition, and there is also the Vedic tradition, and there was very certainly a tradition anterior to both that split into two branches. Well, all these occult experiences have been the same. Only the description differs depending upon the country and the language. The story of creation is not told from a metaphysical or psychological point of view, but from an objective point of view, and this story is as real as our stories of historical periods. Of course, it's not the only way of seeing, but it is just as legitimate a way as the others, and in any event, it recognizes the concrete reality of all these divine beings. Even now, the experiences of Western occultists and those of Eastern occultists exhibit great similarities. The only difference is in the way they are expressed, but the manipulation of the forces is the same.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1020">I learned all this through Th√©on. Probably, he was... I don't know if he was Russian or Polish (a Russian or Polish Jew), he never said who he really was or where he was born, nor his age nor anything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1021">He had assumed two names: one was an Arab name he had adopted when he took refuge in Algeria (I don't know for what reason). After having worked with Blavatsky and having founded an occult society in Egypt, he went to Algeria, and there he first called himself ‚ÄúA√Øa Aziz‚Äù (a word of Arabic origin meaning ‚Äúthe beloved‚Äù). Then, when he began setting up his <em>Cosmic Review</em> and his ‚Äúcosmic group,‚Äù he called himself Max Th√©on, meaning the supreme God (!), the greatest God! And no one knew him by any other name than these two ‚Äì 
A√Øa Aziz or Max Th√©on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1022">He had an English wife.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1023">He said he had received initiation in India (he knew a little Sanskrit and the Rig-Veda thoroughly), and then he formulated a tradition which he called the ‚Äúcosmic tradition‚Äù and which he claimed to have received ‚Äì I don't know how ‚Äì from a tradition anterior to that of the Cabala and the Vedas. But there were many things (Madame Th√©on was the clairvoyant one, and she received visions; oh, she was wonderful!), many things that I myself had seen and known before knowing them which were then substantiated.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page220">Page 220</p>
<p class="PE"> So personally, I am convinced that there was indeed a tradition anterior to both these traditions containing a knowledge very close to an integral knowledge. Certainly, there is a similarity in the experiences. When I came here and told Sri Aurobindo certain things I knew from the occult standpoint, he always said that it conformed to the Vedic tradition. And as for certain occult practices, he told me that they were entirely tantric ‚Äì and I knew nothing at that time, absolutely nothing, neither the Vedas nor the Tantras.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1024">So very probably there was a tradition anterior to both. I have recollections (for me, these are always things I have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVED</span>), very clear, very distinct recollections of a time that was certainly <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> anterior to the Vedic times and to the Cabala, to the Chaldean tradition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1025">But now, there is only a very small number of people in the West who know that it isn't merely subjective or imaginative (the result of a more or less unbridled imagination), and that it corresponds to a universal truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1026">All these regions, all these realms are filled with beings who exist separately in their own realms, and if you are awake and conscious on a given plane ‚Äì for example, if while going out of a more material body you awaken on some higher plane ‚Äì you can have the same relationship with the things and people of that plane as with the things and people of the material world. In other words, there exists an entirely objective relationship that has nothing to do with your own idea of things. Naturally, the resemblance becomes greater and greater as you draw nearer the physical world, the material world, and there is even a moment when one region can act directly upon the other. In any case, in what Sri Aurobindo calls the ‚Äúkingdoms of the overmind,‚Äù you find a concrete reality entirely independent of your personal experience; whenever you come back to it, you again find the same things, with some differences that may have occurred <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DURING YOUR ABSENCE</span>. And your relationships with the beings there are identical to those you have with physical beings, except that they are more flexible, more supple and more direct (for example, there is a capacity to change the outer form, the visible form, according to your inner state), but you can make an appointment with someone, come to the meeting and again find the same being, with only certain differences that may have occurred during your absence ‚Äì but it is absolutely concrete, with absolutely concrete results.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page221">Page 221</p>
<p class="PE"> However, you must have at least a little experience of these things to understand them. Otherwise, if you are convinced that all this is just human fancy or mental formations, if you believe that these gods have such and such a form because men have imagined them to be like that, or that they have such and such defects or qualities because men have envisioned it that way ‚Äì as with all those who say God is created in the image of man and exists only in human thought ‚Äì all such people won't understand, it will seem absolutely ridiculous to them, a kind of madness. You must live a little, touch the subject a little to know how concrete it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1027">Naturally, children know a great deal ‚Äì if they have not been spoiled. There are many children who return to the same place night after night and continue living a life they have begun there. When these faculties are not spoiled with age, they can be preserved within one. There was a time when I was especially interested in dreams, and I could return exactly to the same place and continue some work I had begun there, visit something, for example, or see to something, some work of organization or some discovery or exploration; you go to a certain place, just as you go somewhere in life, then you rest a while, then you go back and begin again ‚Äì you take up your work just where you left it, and you continue. You also notice that there are things entirely independent of you, certain variations which were not at all created by you and which occurred automatically during your absence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1028">But then, you must <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVE</span> these experiences yourself; you yourself must see, you must live them with enough sincerity to see (by being sincere and spontaneous) that they are independent of any mental formations. Because one can take the opposite line and make an intensive study of the way mental formations act upon events ‚Äì which is very interesting. But that's another field. And this study makes you very careful, very prudent, because you start noticing to what extent you can delude yourself. Therefore, both one and the other, the mental formation and the occult reality, must be studied to see what the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ESSENTIAL</span> difference is between them. The one exists in itself, entirely independent of what we think about it, and the other...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1029">That was a grace. I was given every experience without knowing <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ANYTHING</span> of what it was all about ‚Äì my mind was absolutely... blank.

<p class="p-num" id="page222">Page 222</p>
<p class="PE"> find out what it related to. Then I found out. But otherwise, I didn't know. So that was the clear proof that these things existed entirely outside of my imagination or thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1030">It doesn't happen very frequently in this world. And that's why these experiences, which otherwise seem quite natural, quite obvious, appear to be... extravagant fancies to people who know nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1031">But if you transposed this to France, to the West, unless you frequent occult circles, people would look at you with... And behind your back, they would say, ‚ÄúThat person is cracked!‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1035">There are subtle bodies and subtle worlds that correspond to these bodies; it is what the psychological method calls ‚Äústates of consciousness,‚Äù but these states of consciousness really correspond to worlds. The occult process consists in becoming aware of these various inner states of being, or subtle bodies, and of mastering them sufficiently to be able to make one come out of the other, successively. For there is a whole hierarchy of increasing subtleties ‚Äì or decreasing, depending upon the direction ‚Äì and the occult process consists in making a more subtle body come out from a denser body, and so forth, right to the most ethereal regions. You go out through successive exteriorizations into more and more subtle bodies or worlds. Each time it is rather like passing into another dimension. In fact, the fourth dimension of the physicists is only the scientific transcription of an occult knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1036">To give another comparison, it could be said that the physical body is at the center ‚Äì it is the most material and the most condensed, as well as the smallest ‚Äì and the more subtle inner bodies increasingly overlap the limits of this central physical body; they pass through it and extend further and further out, like water evaporating from a porous vase which creates a kind of steam all around it. And the more subtle it is, the more its extension tends to fuse with that of the universe: you finally become universal. It is an entirely concrete process that makes the invisible worlds an objective experience and even allows you to act in those worlds.</p>

<p class="PE"> I found my message for the 1st of January... It was quite unforeseen. Yesterday morning, I thought, ‚ÄúAll the same, I have to find my message, but what?‚Äù I was absolutely... like that, neutral, nothing. Then yesterday evening at the class 
[of Friday, November 7] I noticed that these children who had had a whole week to prepare their questions on the text had not found a single one! A terrible lethargy! A total lack of interest. And when I had finished speaking, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúBut what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span> there in these people who are interested in nothing but their personal little affairs?‚Äù So I began descending into their mental atmosphere, in search of the little light, of that which responds... And it literally pulled me downwards as into a hole, but in such a material way; my hand, which was on the arm of the chair, began slipping down, my other hand went like this <span class="note_1"><em>(to the ground)</em></span>, my head, too! I thought it was going to touch my knees!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1045">And I had the impression... It was not an impression ‚Äì I saw it. I was descending into a crevasse between two steep rocks, rocks that appeared to be made of something harder than basalt, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BLACK</span>, but metallic at the same time, with such sharp edges ‚Äì it seemed that a mere touch would lacerate you. It appeared endless and bottomless, and it kept getting narrower, narrower and narrower, narrower and narrower, like a funnel, so narrow that there was almost no more room ‚Äì not even for the consciousness ‚Äì to pass through. And the bottom was invisible, a black hole. And it went down, down, down, like that, without air, without light, except for a sort of glimmer that enabled me to make out the rock edges. They seemed to be cut so steeply, so sharply... Finally, when my head began touching my knees, I asked myself, ‚ÄúBut what is there at the bottom of this... this hole?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1046">And as soon as I had uttered, ‚ÄúWhat is there at the bottom of this hole?‚Äù I seemed to touch a spring that was in the very depths ‚Äì a spring I didn't see but that acted instantly with a tremendous power ‚Äì and it cast me up forthwith, hurled me out of this crevasse into... <span class="note_1"><em>(arms extended, motionless)</em></span> a formless, limitless vast which was infinitely comfortable ‚Äì not exactly warm, but it gave a feeling of ease and of an intimate warmth.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page226">Page 226</p>
<p class="PE"> And it was all-powerful, with an infinite richness. It did not have... no, it didn't have any kind of form, and it had no limits (naturally, as I was identified with it I knew there was neither limit nor form). It was as if (because it was not visible), as if this vast were made of countless, imperceptible points ‚Äì points that occupied no place in space (there was no sense of space), that were of a deep warm gold ‚Äì but this is only a feeling, a transcription. And all this was absolutely <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVING</span>, living with a power that seemed infinite. And yet motionless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1047">It lasted for quite some time, for the rest of the meditation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1048">It seemed to contain a whole wealth of possibilities, and all this that was formless had the power to become form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1049">At the time, I wondered what it meant. Later, of course, I found out, and finally this morning, I said to myself, ‚ÄúAh, so that's it! It came to give me my message for the new year!‚Äù Then I transcribed the experience ‚Äì it can't be described, of course, for it was indescribable; it was a psychological phenomenon and the form it took was only a way of describing the psychological state to oneself. Here is what I wrote down, obviously in a mental way, and I am thinking of using it as my message.</p>

Because I had asked myself the question, ‚ÄúBut what is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAPPENING</span> in there behind all those forms?...‚Äù I can't say that I was annoyed, but I said to myself, ‚ÄúWell really, this has to be shaken up a bit!‚Äù And just as I had finished, something pulled me ‚Äì it pulled me out of my body, I was literally pulled out of my body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1057">And then, down into this hole... I still see what I saw then, this crevasse between two rocks. The sky was not visible, but on the rock summits I saw... something like the reflection of a glimmer ‚Äì a glimmer ‚Äì coming from ‚Äúsomething‚Äù beyond, which <span class="note_1"><em>(laughing)</em></span> must have been the sky! But it was invisible. And as I descended, as if I were sliding down the face of this crevasse, I saw the rock edges; and they were really black rocks, as if cut with a chisel, cuts so fresh that they glistened, with edges as sharp as knives. There was one here, one there, another there, everywhere, all around. And I was being pulled, pulled, pulled, I went down and down and down ‚Äì there was no end to it, and it was becoming more and more compressing.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="94" href="#">1</a> It went down and down...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1058">And so, physically, the body followed. My body has been taught to express the inner experience to a certain extent. In the body there is the body-force or the body-form or the body-spirit (according to the different schools, it bears a different name), and this is what leaves the body last when one dies, usually taking a period of seven days to leave.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">2</a> With special training, it can acquire a conscious life ‚Äì independent and conscious ‚Äì to such a degree that not only in a state of trance (in trance, it frequently happens that one can speak and move if one is slightly trained or educated), but even in a cataleptic state it can produce sounds and even make the body move.

(The consciousness was elsewhere, I saw it from outside ‚Äì it was not that I didn't know what I was doing, I saw it from outside.) So I said, ‚ÄúIn any case, this has to stop somewhere because if it continues, my head <span class="note_1"><em>(laughing)</em></span>

My body immediately sat straight up, head on high, following the movement. If someone had been watching, this is what he would have seen: in a single bound, vrrrm! Straight up, to the maximum, my head on high.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1060">And I followed all this without objectifying it in the least; I was not aware of what it was nor of what was happening, nor of any explanation at all, nothing: it was ‚Äúlike that.‚Äù I was living it, that's all.

I can't explain it otherwise, an <em>ease</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">4</a> but an ease... to the utmost. A perfect immobility in a sense of eternity ‚Äì but with an extraordinary <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INTENSITY</span> of movement and life! An inner intensity, unmanifested; it was within, self-contained.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1070">The objectification of the experience came progressively, as always happens to me.

How much time it has taken me to learn this!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1071">There is no preliminary thought, preliminary knowledge, preliminary will: all those things do not exist. I am only like a mirror receiving the experience, the simplicity of a little child learning life. It is like that. And it is the gift of the Grace, truly the Grace: in the face of the experience, the simplicity of a little child just born. And it is spontaneously so, but deliberately too; in other words, during the experience I am very careful not to watch myself having the experience so that no previous knowledge intervenes. Only afterwards do I see. It is not a mental construction, nor does it come from something higher than the mind (it is not even a knowledge by identity that makes me see things); no, the body (when the</p>

<p class="PE"> experience is in the body) is... like that, what in English is called <em>blank</em>. As if it had just been born, as if just then it were being born with the experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1072">And only little by little, little by little, is this experience put in the presence of any previous knowledge. Thus, its explanation and its evaluation come about progressively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1073">It is indispensable if one doesn't want to be arbitrary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1074">So in fact, only the final wording is correct, but from the point of view of the ‚Äúhistorical‚Äù unfolding, it is interesting to observe the passage. It was exactly the same phenomenon for the experience of the Supramental Manifestation. Both these things, the experience of November 7 and of the Supramental, occurred in the same way, identically: I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> the experience, and nothing else. Nothing but the experience at the time it was occurring. And only slowly, while coming out of it, did the previous knowledge, the previous experiences, all the accumulation of what had come before, examine it and put it in its place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1075">This is why I arrive at a verbal expression progressively, gropingly; these are not literary gropings ‚Äì it is aimed at being precise, specific and concise at the same time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1076">When I write something, I don't expect people to understand it, but I try to avoid the least possible distortion of the experience or the image in this kind of ‚Äúshrinking‚Äù towards expression.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1077"><em>What is this spring?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1078">The spring? It means exactly this: in the deepest depths of the Inconscient is the supreme spring that makes us touch the Supreme. It is like the Supreme making us touch the Supreme: that is the almighty spring. When you arrive at the very bottom of the Inconscient, you touch the Supreme.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1079"><em>So that is the shortest path!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1080">Not the shortest path! Already for me, it was hard to touch the bottom of the Inconscient, but for others it would take an eternity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1081">It is something similar to what Sri Aurobindo has written in ‚ÄúA God's Labour.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1082"><em>Was it the Supreme at the very bottom of the Inconscient who cast you up directly to the Supreme?</em></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page232">Page 232</p>
<p class="PE"> Yes. Because at the very bottom of the Inconscient is the Supreme. It is the same idea as the highest height touching the deepest depth. The universe is like a circle ‚Äì it is represented by the serpent biting its tail, its head touching its tail. It means that the supreme height touches the most material matter, without any intermediary. I have already said this several times. But that was the experience. I didn't know what was happening. I expected nothing and... it was stupendous ‚Äì in a single bound, I sprang up! If someone had had his eyes open, I assure you he would have had to laugh: I was bent over, like this, more and more, more and more, more and more, my head was just about to touch my knees when suddenly ‚Äì vrrrm! Straight, straight up, my head upright in a single bound!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1083">But as soon as you want to express it, it escapes like water running through your fingers; all the fluidity is lost, it evaporates. A rather vague, poetic or artistic expression is much truer, much nearer to the truth ‚Äì something hazy, nebulous, undefined. Something not concretized like a rigid mental expression ‚Äì this rigidity that the mind has introduced right down into the Inconscient.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1084">This vision of the Inconscient... <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother remains gazing for a moment)</em></span> it was the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MENTAL</span> Inconscient. Because the starting point was mental. A special Inconscient ‚Äì rigid, hard, resistant ‚Äì with all that the mind has brought into our consciousness. But it was far worse, far worse than a purely material Inconscient! A ‚Äúmentalized‚Äù Inconscient, as it were. All this rigidity, this hardness, this narrowness, this fixity ‚Äì a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FIXITY</span> ‚Äì comes from the presence of the mind in creation. When the mind was not manifested, the Inconscient was not like that! It was formless and had the plasticity of something that is formless ‚Äì the plasticity has gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1085">It is a terrible image of the Mind's action in the Inconscient.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1086">It has made the Inconscient aggressive ‚Äì it was not so before. Aggressive, resistant, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OBSTINATE</span>. That was not there before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1087">Yes, that's it. It was not an ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Inconscient. It was a mentalized Inconscient. With all that the mind has brought in in the way of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OPPOSITION</span> ‚Äì of resistance, hardness, rigidity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1088">It would be interesting to mention this.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1089">Because the starting point, precisely, was to look into the mental unconsciousness of these people. It was the mental Inconscient. Well, the mental Inconscient <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">REFUSES</span> to change ‚Äì which is not true of the other one; the other is nothing, it doesn't exist,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page233">Page 233</p>
<p class="PE"> it is not organized in any way, it has no way of being, whereas this one is an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ORGANIZED</span> Inconscient ‚Äì organized by a beginning mental influence. A hundred times worse!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1090">This is a very interesting point to note.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1091">It is not the experience, which I had once before, of the original Inconscient. The experience I had this time is of the Inconscient that has undergone the influence of the Mind in creation. It has become... It has become a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FAR</span> greater obstacle than before. Before, it did not even have the power to resist, it had nothing, it was truly unconscious.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1092">It was a very new experience.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1104">Truly speaking, perhaps one is never rid of the hostile forces as long as one has not permanently emerged into the Light, above the lower hemisphere. There, the term ‚Äúhostile forces‚Äù loses its meaning; they become only forces of progress, they force you to progress. But to see things in this way, you have to get out of the lower hemisphere, for below, they are very real in their opposition to the divine plan.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1105">It was said in the ancient traditions that one could not live for more than twenty days in this higher state without leaving one's body and returning to the supreme Origin. Now this is no longer true.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page235">Page 235</p>
<p class="PE"> It is precisely this state of perfect Harmony beyond all attacks that will become possible with the supramental realization. It is what all those who are destined for the supramental transformation will realize. The hostile forces know it well; in the supramental world, they will automatically disappear. Having no more utility, they will be dissolved without our having to do anything, simply through the presence of the supramental force. So now they are being unleashed with a fury in a negation of everything, everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1106">The link between the two worlds has not yet been built, but it is in the process of being built; this was the meaning of the experience of February 3, 1958<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">1</a>: to build a link between the two worlds. For both worlds are indeed there ‚Äì not one above the other, but within each other, in two different dimensions. Only, there is no communication between them; they overlap, as it were, without being connected. In the experience of February 3, I saw certain people from here (and from elsewhere) who already belong to the supramental world in a part of their being, but there is no connection, no link. But now the hour has come in universal history for this link to be built.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1107"><em>What is the relationship between this experience of February 3 and that of November 7 (the almighty spring)? Is what you found in the depths of the Inconscient this same Supramental?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1108">The experience of November 7 was a further step in the building of the link between the two worlds. Where I was cast was clearly into the origin of the supramental creation ‚Äì all this warm gold, this tremendous living power, this sovereign peace. And once again I saw that the values governing the supramental world have nothing to do with our values here, even the values of our highest wisdom, even those we consider the most divine when we live constantly in a divine Presence: it is utterly different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1109">Not only in our state of adoration and surrender to the Supreme, but even in our state of identification, the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">QUALITY</span> of the identification is different depending upon whether we are on this side, progressing in this hemisphere, or have passed to the other side and have emerged into the other world, the other hemisphere, the higher hemisphere.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page236">Page 236</p>
<p class="PE"> The quality or the kind of relationship I had with the Supreme at that moment was entirely different from the one we have here ‚Äì even the identification had a different quality. One can very well understand that all the lower movements are different, but this identification by which the Supreme governs and lives in us was the summit of our experience here ‚Äì well, the way He governs and lives is different depending on whether we are in this hemisphere here or in the supramental life. And at that moment 
[the experience of November 13], what made the experience so intense was that I came to perceive vaguely both these states of consciousness at once. It was almost as if the Supreme Himself were different, or our experience of Him. And yet, in both cases, it was a contact with the Supreme. It is probably how we perceive Him or the way in which we translate it that differs, but the fact is that the quality of the experience is different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1110">In the other hemisphere, there is an intensity and a plenitude which are translated by a power different from the one here. How can I formulate it? ‚Äì I cannot.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1111">The quality of the consciousness itself seems to change. It is not something higher than the summit we can attain here, it is not one <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MORE</span> rung, not that. Here, we have reached the end, the summit, but... it's the quality that is different. The quality, in the sense that a fullness, a richness, a power is there (this is a translation, you see, in our way), but there is a ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that... that eludes us. It is truly a new reversal of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1112">When we begin living the spiritual life, a reversal of consciousness takes place which for us is the proof that we have entered the spiritual life; well, yet another occurs when we enter the supramental world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1113">And probably each time a new world opens up, there will again be a new reversal. This is why even our spiritual life, which is such a total reversal compared to ordinary life, seems something still so... so totally different when compared to this supramental consciousness that the values are almost opposite.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1114">It can be expressed in this way (but it's quite approximate, more than diminished or deformed): it's as if our entire spiritual life were made of silver, whereas the supramental life is made of gold ‚Äì as if our entire spiritual life here were a vibration of silver, not cold but simply a light, a light that goes right to the summit, an absolutely pure light, pure and intense; but in the other, in the supramental world, there is a richness and a power that make all the</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page237">Page 237</p>
<p class="PE"> difference. This whole spiritual life of the psychic being and of all our present consciousness that appears so warm, so full, so wonderful, so luminous to the ordinary consciousness, well, all this splendor seems poor in comparison to the splendor of the new world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1115">I can explain the phenomenon like this: successive reversals such that an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVER NEW</span> richness of creation will take place from stage to stage, making whatever came before seem so poor in comparison. What to us seems supremely rich compared to our ordinary life, appears so poor compared to this new reversal of consciousness. Such was my experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1116">Last night, my effort to understand what was missing in order to help you completely and truly come out of the difficulty reminded me of what I said the other day about Power, the transforming power, the true realizing power, the supramental power. When you enter that, when you suddenly surge into that Thing, then you see ‚Äì you see that it is truly almighty in comparison to what we are here. So once again, I touched it, I experienced both states simultaneously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1117">But as long as this is not an accomplished fact, it will still be a progression ‚Äì a progression, an ascension; you gain a little, you gain some ground, you rise higher and higher.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1121">I don't have all the information, otherwise certainly... Two things made me see... I saw them the other day. First of all, when you didn't understand my letter, for I wrote it to a part of you that without any doubt should have understood; I was referring to something other than what is seen and known by this part of you which is... this center, this knot of revolt that seems to resist everything, that really remains knotted, in spite of your experiences and the strides you have made, as well as your openings. And what made me see is especially the fact that it resists experiences, it is not touched by experiences; this was the point that did not understand what I wrote. Because the part of you that had the experience must necessarily understand what I wrote, without the shadow of a doubt.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1122">Time is needed...</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page239">Page 239</p>
<p class="PE"> I had two visions which are certainly related to this. The most recent one was yesterday, and it concerned a past life in India. It is something that took place in India about one thousand years ago, perhaps a little more (I am not yet sure about this). And it contains both things. It's strange, both things together ‚Äì the origin of the power of realization in this life and the obstacle to be conquered.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1123">I had the last vision yesterday evening. You were much taller than you are now; you were wearing the orange robe, and you were backed up against a door of bronze, a bronze door like the door of a temple or a palace... but at the same time it was symbolic (it was a fact, it actually took place like this, but at the same time it was symbolic). And... unfortunately, it didn't last because I was disturbed. But it contained the key.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1124">I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY HAPPY</span> with the vision, for there was a great <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POWER</span>, though it was rather... terrible. But it was magnificent. When I saw that, I... This vision was given to me because I had concentrated with a will to find the solution, a true solution, an enduring and permanent solution ‚Äì that is, I had this spontaneous gratitude which goes out to the Grace when it brings some effective help. Only, what followed was interrupted by someone who came to call me and that cut it short, but it will return.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1125">But now I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span> ‚Äì before I did not know. The other morning I saw, and I was told very clearly that it was a karma<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="101" href="#">1</a> to be worked out; so then I told you, but at the time I didn't know what it was.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1126">And I saw that with the new Power, the supramental power... That is something absolutely new... It used to be thought that nothing had the power to eliminate the consequences of karma and that only by exhausting it through a series of actions could its consequences be transformed... exhausted, eliminated. But I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span> that with the supramental power it can be done without following all the steps of the process.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1127">In any event, one point is clear: it is something that happened in India, and the origin of the karma and the remedy of the karma go together. And it has to do with this initiation you received in Rameswaram.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">2</a></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1137"><em>Even at a very young age, I had a kind of intuition of my destiny. I felt that something in me had to be exhausted, or that I had to exhaust myself. I don't know, as though I had to descend into the depths of the night to find the thing. I thought it was the concentration camps. Perhaps this was still not deep enough... Do you see any meaning in all this?</em></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page241">Page 241</p>
<p class="PE"> It can hardly be formulated; these are merely impressions that follow one another. I know that when you thought of leaving with Swami,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="103" href="#">1</a> I saw that a door was opening, that it was the truth, that this was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IT</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1138">My immediate impression was that you were being put in direct contact with this... this sort of Fatality that here they call karma, which is the consequence... yes, something that must be exhausted, something that remains in the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1139">This is how it works: the psychic being passes from one life to another, but there are cases in which the psychic incarnates in order to... to <em>work out</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="104" href="#">2</a>... to pass through a certain experience, to learn a certain thing, to develop a certain thing through a certain experience. And so in this life, in the life where the experience is to be made, it can happen (there may be more than one reason) that the soul does not come down accurately in the place it should have, some shift or other may occur, a set of contrary circumstances ‚Äì this happens sometimes ‚Äì and then the incarnation miscarries entirely and the soul leaves. But in other cases, the soul is simply placed in the impossibility of doing exactly what it wants and it finds itself swept away by... unfortunate circumstances. Not only unfortunate from an objective standpoint, but unfortunate for its own development, and then that creates in it the necessity to begin the experience all over again, and in much more difficult conditions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1140">And if ‚Äì it can happen ‚Äì if the second attempt also miscarries, if the conditions make the experience the soul is seeking still more difficult... for example, if one is in a body with an inadequate will or some distortion in the thought, or an egoism too... too hardened, and it ends in suicide, it is dreadful. I have seen this many times, it creates a dreadful karma that can be repeated for lifetimes on end before the soul can conquer it and manage to do what it wants. And each time, the conditions become more difficult, each time it requires a still greater effort. And people who know this say, ‚ÄúYou cannot get out!‚Äù In fact, it is this kind of desire to escape which pushes you into more foolish things<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="105" href="#">3</a> that result in a still greater accumulation of difficulty. There are moments</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page242">Page 242</p>
<p class="PE"> ‚Äì moments and circumstances ‚Äì when no one is there to help you, and then things become so... horrible, the circumstances become so abominable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1141">But if the soul has had but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> call, but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> contact with the Grace, then in your next life you are put in the conditions, once, whereby <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> can be swept away at one stroke. And at this present moment on earth, you cannot imagine the number of people I have met ‚Äì that is, the number of souls ‚Äì who had reached out towards this possibility with such an intensity ‚Äì and they have all found themselves on my path.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1142">At that point, sometimes a great courage is needed, sometimes a great endurance is needed, sometimes a true love is enough, sometimes, oh! if only faith were there, one thing, one tiny little thing is enough, and... everything can be swept away. I have done it often; there are times when I have failed. But more often than not I have been able to remove it. But then, what is needed is a great, stoical courage or a capacity to endure and to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEE IT THROUGH</span>. The resistance (especially in cases of former suicide), the resistance to the temptation of renewing this stupidity creates a terrible formation. Or else this habit of fleeing when suffering comes: flee, flee, instead of... absorbing the difficulty, holding on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1143">But just this, a faith in the Grace, or an awareness of the Grace, or the intensity of the call, or else naturally the response ‚Äì the response, the thing that opens, that breaks ‚Äì the response to this marvelous love of the Grace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1144">It is difficult without a strong will; and above all, above all the capacity to resist the temptation, which was the fatal temptation throughout all one's lives ‚Äì because its power builds up. Each defeat gives it renewed force. But a tiny victory can dissolve it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1145">Oh, the most terrible of all is when one does not have the strength, the courage, something indomitable! How many times do they come to tell me, ‚ÄúI want to die, I want to flee, I want to die.‚Äù ‚Äì I say, ‚ÄúBut die, then, die to yourself! No one is asking you to let your ego survive! Die to yourself since you want to die! Have that courage, the true courage, to die to your egoism.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1146">But because it is karma, one must, one must <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DO</span> something oneself. Karma is the construction of the ego; the ego <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST DO</span> something, everything cannot be done for it. This is it, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span> is the thing: karma is the result of the ego's actions, and only when the ego abdicates is the karma dissolved. One can help it along,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page243">Page 243</p>
<p class="PE"> one can assist it, give it strength, bestow courage upon it, but the ego must then make use of it.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1147">So this is what I saw for you: that the crystallization of this karma occurred during a life in India in which you were put in the presence of the possibility of liberation and... I don't know the details; I don't know the material facts at all. So far, I know nothing, I have only had a vision. I saw you there, as I told you, taller than you are now, in an Indian body, north Indian, for it was not dark but fair. But there was a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HARDNESS</span> in the being, the hardness born of a kind of despair mixed with rebellion, incomprehension and an ego that resists. That is all I know. The image was of you backed up against a bronze door: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BACKED UP</span> against it. I didn't see what had caused it. As I told you, something interrupted me, so I was unable to follow it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1148">The other indication is what I told you the other day. When you thought of leaving to join Swami, I immediately saw a stream of light: Ah, the road is opening up! So I said, ‚ÄúIt is good.‚Äù And while you were away in Ceylon, I followed you from day to day. You called much more than the second time, when you were in the Himalayas; and with the physical hardships you were undergoing, I was very, very close to you ‚Äì I constantly felt what was happening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1149">And then I saw a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> light, like a glory, when you were at Rameswaram. A great light. And when you returned here, this light was upon you, very strong and imposing. But at the same time, I felt that it needed protecting ‚Äì to be shielded, protected ‚Äì that it was not yet established. Established, ready to resist all that decomposes an experience. I would have liked to have kept you apart, under a glass case, but then I saw that this would have drawbacks as well as advantages. Also, I liked the way you wanted to fight against an uncomprehending reception due to your orange robes and your shaved head. Of course, it was a much shorter path than the other, but it was more difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1150">And then, more and more, I felt that if what I saw, as I saw it, could be realized... I saw two things: a journey ‚Äì not at all a pilgrimage as it is commonly understood ‚Äì a journey towards solitude in arduous conditions, and a sojourn in a very severe solitude, facing the mountains, in arduous physical conditions. The contact with this majesty of Nature has a great influence</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page244">Page 244</p>
<p class="PE"> upon the ego at certain moments: it has the power to dissolve it. But all this complication, all these organized pilgrimages, all that... it brings in the whole petty side of human life which spoils everything...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1151"><em>Yes, that whole journey was odious...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1152">...which spoils everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1153">The other thing was the tantric initiation. But I wanted the conditions of this initiation to be at least as favorable as those in Rameswaram, by which I mean conducted by someone very capable and as far as possible free from the whole formalistic and external side. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">A TRUE</span> initiation ‚Äì someone who would be capable of pulling down the Power and putting you in conditions rigorous enough for you to be able to hold this Power, to receive it and hold it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1154">As soon as you had left, and since I was following you, I saw that nothing of the kind was going to happen, but rather something very superficial which would not be of much use. And when I received your letters and saw that you were in difficulty, I did something. There are places that are favorable for occult experiences. Benares is one of these places, the atmosphere there is filled with vibrations of occult forces, and if one has the slightest capacity, it spontaneously develops there, in the same way that a spiritual aspiration develops very strongly and spontaneously as soon as one lands in India. These are Graces. Graces, because it is the destiny of the country, it has been so throughout its history, and because India has always been turned much more towards the heights and the inner depths than towards the outer world. Now, it is in the process of losing all that and wallowing in the mud, but that's another story... it was like that and it is still like that. And in fact, when you returned from Rameswaram with your robes, I saw with much satisfaction that there was still a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> dignity and a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> sincerity in this endeavor of the Sannyasis towards the higher life and in the self-giving of a certain number of people to realize this higher life. When you returned, it had become a very concrete and a very real thing that immediately commanded respect. Before, I had seen only a copy, an imitation, an hypocrisy, a pretention ‚Äì nothing that was really lived. But then, I saw that it was true, that it was lived, that it was real and that it was still India's great heritage. I don't believe it is very prevalent now, but in any case, it is still there, and as I told you,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page245">Page 245</p>
<p class="PE"> it commands respect. And then, as I felt you in difficulty and as the outer conditions were not only veiling but spoiling the inner, well, on that day I wrote you a short note ‚Äì I no longer recall when it was exactly, but I wrote you just a word or two, which I put in an envelope and sent you ‚Äì I concentrated very strongly upon those few words and sent you something. I didn't note the date, I don't remember when it was, but it's likely that it happened as I wished when you were in Benares; and then you had this experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1155">But when you returned the second time, from the Himalayas, you didn't have the same flame as when you returned the first time. And I understood that this kind of difficult karma still clung to you, that it had not been dissolved. I had hoped that your contact with the mountains ‚Äì but in a true solitude (I don't mean that your body had to be all alone, but there should not have been all kinds of outer, superficial things)... Anyway, it didn't happen. So it means that the time had not come.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1156">But when here the difficulties returned ‚Äì and because of their obstinacy, their appearance of an inevitable fatality ‚Äì I concluded that it was a karma, although I knew it with certainty only now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1157">But I always had a presentiment of the true thing: that only a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY COURAGEOUS</span> act of self-giving could efface the thing ‚Äì not courageous or difficult from the material point of view, not that... There is a certain zone of the vital in you, a mentalized vital but still very material, which is very much under the influence of circumstances and which very much believes in the effectiveness of outer measures ‚Äì this is what is resisting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1158">That is all I know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1159">Generally, when the hour has come for a karma to be overcome and absorbed in the Grace, the image or the knowledge or the experience of the exact facts that are the origin of the karma come to me, and I can then perform... the cleansing action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1160">For the time being, it is not yet there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1161">Only, and this is what I wrote to you the other day which you did not understand: it is precisely at the most painful point, at the time when the suggestions are strongest, that one must hold on. Otherwise, it has always to be done all over again, always to be reconfronted. There comes a day, a moment, when it has to be done. And now, there is truly an opportunity on earth that is offered only once in thousands of years, a conscious help, with the necessary Power...</p>

Certainly, there is a period when they don't know that they have the key, but even long after they do know it, long after they have been told, they hesitate to use it and doubt that it has the power to open the doors and windows, or even that it may be advisable to open them. And even once they feel that ‚ÄúAfter all, it might be a good thing,‚Äù a fear pursues them: ‚ÄúWhat is going to happen once all these doors and these windows open?...‚Äù They become afraid ‚Äì afraid of losing themselves in this light and in this freedom.

According to my personal experience, it had always seemed to me that if one is exclusively turned towards the Supreme in all one's actions and expresses Him directly, whatever is to be done is done automatically. For example, if you are always open and if at each second you consciously want to express only what the Supreme Lord wants to be expressed, it is done automatically. But with all that I have learned about pujas, about certain scriptures and certain rituals as well, the necessity for a ‚Äúprocess‚Äù has become very clear to me. It's the same as in physical life; in physical life, everything needs a process, as we know, and it is the knowledge of processes that constitutes physical science. Similarly, in a more occult working, the knowledge and especially the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">RESPECT</span> for the process seem to be much more important than I had first thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1180">And when I studied this, when I looked at this science of processes, of intermediaries, suddenly I clearly understood the working of karma, which I had not understood before. I had worked and intervened quite often to change someone's karma, but sometimes I had to wait, without exactly knowing why ‚Äì the result was not immediate. I simply used to wait without worrying about the reasons for this slowness or delay. That's how it was. And generally it ended, as I said, with the exact vision of the karma's source, its initial cause; and scarcely would I have this vision when the Power would come, and the thing would be dissolved. But I didn't bother about finding out why it was like that.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page249">Page 249</p>
<p class="PE"> One day I had mentioned this to X<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="107" href="#">1</a> when he was showing me or describing to me the different movements of the pujas, the procedure, the process of the puja. I said to him, ‚ÄúOh, I see! For the action to be immediate, for the result to be immediate, one must acknowledge, for example, the role or the participation of certain spirits or certain forces and enter into a friendly relationship or collaboration with these forces in order to obtain an immediate result, is it not so?‚Äù Then he told me, ‚ÄúYes, otherwise it leaves an indefinite time to the play of the forces, and you don't know when you will get the result of your puja.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1181">That interested me very much. Because one of the obstacles I had felt was that although the Force was acting well, there was a time lag that appeared inevitable, a time element in the work which seemed unavoidable ‚Äì a play left to the forces of Nature. But with their knowledge of the processes, the tantrics can dispense with all that. So I understood why those who have studied, who are initiated and follow the prescribed methods are apparently more powerful ‚Äì more powerful even than those who are conscious in the highest consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1182">What interested me is that in their case (those who follow tantric or other initiations), what is doubtful is whether or not they can succeed in receiving the response of the true Power, the divine power, the supreme power; they do everything they can, but this question still remains. Whereas for me, it is the opposite situation: the Power is there, I have it, but how can I make it act here in matter? The process for making it act immediately was missing ‚Äì though not totally; I know from the psychological standpoint, but there is something other than the psychological power, there is the whole play of conscious, individualized forces that are everywhere in Nature and that have the right to exist. Since it was created this way, it must express something of the supreme Will, otherwise He wouldn't have made use of intermediaries ‚Äì but in His plan, it is obvious that the intermediary has a legitimate place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1183">It is like the story X told me of his guru<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="108" href="#">2</a> who could command the coming of Kali (something which seems quite natural to me when one is sufficiently developed); well, not only could he command the coming of Kali, but Kali with I don't know how many crores of her warriors!... For me, Kali was Kali, after all, and</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page250">Page 250</p>
<p class="PE"> she did her work; but in the universal organization, her action, the innumerable multiplicity of her action, is expressed by an innumerable multitude of conscious entities at work. It is this individualization, as it were, that gives to these forces a consciousness and a certain play of freedom, and this is what makes all the difference in action. It is in this respect that the occult system is an absolutely indispensable complement to spiritual action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1184">The spiritual action is direct, but it may not be immediate (anyway, that's my experience). Sri Aurobindo said that with the supramental presence, it becomes immediate ‚Äì and I have experienced this. But this would then mean that the supramental Power automatically commands all these intermediaries, whereas if it's not present, even the highest spiritual power would need a specialized knowledge to act in this realm, a knowledge equivalent to an occult or initiatory knowledge of all these realms. This is why I told X, ‚ÄúWell, you taught me many things while you were here.‚Äù There is always something to learn.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1185">Of course, when the Supramental is here, it will be very different. I see it clearly: in moments when it is there, everything is turned inside out, and all this belongs to a world... to the world of preparation. It is like a preparation, a long preparation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1186">It remains to be seen if all this has first to be mastered before there is even the possibility of holding the Supramental, of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FIXING</span> it in the manifestation. That is the great difference. For example, those with the power to materialize forces or beings lack the capacity to fix them, for these are fluid things which act and are then dissolved. That is the difference with the physical world where it is this condensation of energy that makes things... <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother strikes the arms of her chair)</em></span> stable. All the things in the extraphysical realms are not stable, they are fluid ‚Äì fluid and consequently uncertain.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="109" href="#">3</a></p>

<p class="PE"><em>(This note was written by Mother in English. It concerns an attack of black magic that threatened her life and in the end completely changed her outer existence. A new stage begins.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1190">Two or three days after I retired to my room upstairs,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="110" href="#">1</a> early in the night I fell into a very heavy sleep and found myself out of the body much more materially than I do usually. This degree of density in which you can see the material surroundings exactly as they are. The part that was out seemed to be under a spell and only half conscious. When I found myself at the first floor where everything was absolutely black, I wanted to go up again, but then I discovered that my hand was held by a young girl whom I could not see in the darkness but whose contact was very familiar. She pulled me by the hand telling me laughingly, ‚ÄúNo, come, come down with me, we shall kill the young princess.‚Äù I could not understand what she meant by this ‚Äúyoung princess‚Äù and, rather unwillingly, I followed her to see what it was. Arriving in the anteroom which is at the top of the staircase leading to the groundfloor, my attention was drawn in the midst of all this total obscurity to the white figure of Kamala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">2</a> standing in the middle of the passage between the hall and Sri Aurobindo's room. She was as it were in full light while everything else was black. Then I saw on her face such an expression of intense anxiety that to comfort her I said, ‚ÄúI am coming back.‚Äù The sound of my voice shook off from me the semi-trance in which I was before and suddenly I thought, ‚ÄúWhere am I going?‚Äù and I pushed away from me the dark figure who was pulling me and in whom, while she was running down the steps, I recognized a young girl who lived with Sri Aurobindo and me for many years and died five years back. This girl during her life was under the most diabolical influence. And</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page253">Page 253</p>
<p class="PE"> then I saw very distinctly (as through the walls of the staircase) down below a small black tent which could scarcely be perceived in the surrounding darkness and standing in the middle of the tent the figure of a man, head and face shaved (like the sannyasin or the Buddhist monks) covered from head to foot with a knitted outfit following tightly the form of his body which was tall and slim. No other cloth or garment could give an indication as to who he could be. He was standing in front of a black pot placed on a dark red fire which was throwing its reddish glow on him. He had his right arm stretched over the pot, holding between two fingers a thin gold chain which looked like one of mine and was unnaturally visible and bright. Shaking gently the chain he was chanting some words which translated in my mind, ‚ÄúShe must die the young princess, she must pay for all she has done, she must die the young princess‚Äù.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1191">Then I suddenly realized that it was I the young Princess and as I burst into laughter, I found myself awake in my bed.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1204">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1205">I have only now received your first letter which you had sent to Hyderabad. It arrived in time to do me some good, for I am living through critical moments.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1206">Swami received me warmly and is doing all he can with all his heart. I am following his instructions to the letter for I believe that your grace is acting through him. Furthermore, he is totally devoted to you and spoke of you as no one ever has ‚Äì he understands many things. I was unfair in my reactions towards him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1207">At the new moon, when I felt very down, he gave me the first tantric mantra ‚Äì a mantra to Durga. For a period of 41 days, I must repeat it 125,000 times and go every morning to the Temple, stand before Parvati and recite this mantra within me for at least one hour. Then I must go to the sanctuary of Shiva and recite another mantra for half an hour. Practically speaking, I have to repeat constantly within me the mantra to Durga in a silent concentration, whatever I may be doing on the outside. In these conditions, it is difficult to think of you and this has created a slight conflict in me, but I believe that your Grace is acting through Swami and through Durga, whom I am invoking all the time ‚Äì I remember what you told me about the necessity for ‚Äúintermediaries‚Äù and I am obeying Swami unreservedly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1208">Mother, things are far from being what they were the first time in Rameswaram, and I am living through certain moments that are hell ‚Äì the enemy seems to have been unleashed with an extraordinary violence. It comes in waves, and after it recedes, I am literally <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SHATTERED</span> ‚Äì physically, mentally and vitally drained. This morning, while going to the temple, I lived through one of these moments. All this suffering that suddenly sweeps down upon me is horrible. Yes, I had the feeling of being <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BACKED UP AGAINST A WALL</span>, exactly as in your vision ‚Äì I was up against a wall. I was walking among these immense arcades of sculptured granite and I could see myself walking, very small, all alone, alone, ravaged with pain, filled with a nameless despair, for nowhere was there a way out. The sea was nearby and I could</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page256">Page 256</p>
<p class="PE"> have thrown myself into it; otherwise, there was only the sanctuary of Parvati ‚Äì but there was no more Africa to flee to, everything closed in all around me, and I kept repeating, <em>‚ÄúWhy? Why?‚Äù</em> This much suffering was truly inhuman, as if my last twenty years of nightmare were crashing down upon me. I gritted my teeth and went to the sanctuary to say my mantra. The pain in me was so strong that I broke into a cold sweat and almost fainted. Then it subsided. Yet even now I feel completely battered.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1209">I clearly see that the hour has come: either I will perish right here, or else I will emerge from this <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">COMPLETELY</span> changed.

If these moments of utter darkness return ‚Äì and they are bound to return for everything to be exorcised and conquered ‚Äì protect me in spite of myself. Mother, may your Grace not abandon me. I want to be done with all these old phantoms, I want to be born anew in your Light; it has to be ‚Äì otherwise I can no longer go on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1210">Mother, I believe I understand something of all that you yourself are suffering, and the crucifixion of the Divine in Matter is a real crucifixion.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1222">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1223">Your last letter was a great comfort to me. If you were not there, with me, everything would be so absurd and impossible. I am again disturbing you because Swami tells me that you are worried and that I should write to you. Not much has changed, except that I am holding on and am confident. Yesterday, I again suffered an agonizing wave, in the temple, and I found just enough strength to repeat your name with each beat of my heart, like someone drowning. I remained as motionless as a pillar of stone before the sanctuary, with only your name (my mantra would not come out), then it cleared. It was brutal. I am confident that with each wave I am gaining in strength, and I know you are there. But I am aware that if the enemy is so violent it is because something in me responds, or has responded, something that has not made its ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù ‚Äì that is the critical point. Mother, may your grace help me to place everything in your hands, everything, without any shadow. I want so much to emerge into the Light, to be rid of all this once and for all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1224">I am following Swami's instructions to the letter. Sometimes it all seems to lack warmth and spontaneity, but I am holding on. I might add that we are living right next to the bazaar, amidst a great racket 20 hours a day, which does not make things easier. So I repeat my mantra as one pounds his fists against the walls of a prison. Sometimes it opens a little, you send me a little joy, and then everything becomes better again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1225">Swami told me that the mantra to Durga is intended to pierce through into the subconscient. To complement this work, he does his pujas to Kali, and finally one of his friends, X, the ‚ÄúHigh Priest‚Äù of the temple in Rameswaram (who presided over my initiation and has great occult powers), has undertaken to say a ‚Äúvery powerful‚Äù mantra over me daily, for a period of eight days, to extirpate the dark forces from my subconscious. The operation already began four days ago. While reciting his mantra, he holds a glass of water in his hand, then he makes me drink it. It seems that on the eighth day, if the enemy has been trapped, this water</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page259">Page 259</p>
<p class="PE"> turns yellow ‚Äì then the operation is over and the 
empoisoned water is thrown out. (I tell you all this because I prefer that you know.) In any event, I like X very much, he is a very luminous, very good man. If I am not delivered after all this!...</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Rameswaram, December 28, 1958</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1237">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1238">One sentence in your letter prompted much reflection; you write that X's action might ‚Äúbe useful here, too.‚Äù After hesitating, I told Swami of the magic attack aimed directly against you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1239">If you wish, two things can be done to help your action: either X can undertake certain mantric operations upon you here in Rameswaram, or better still, he can immediately come to Pondicherry with Swami and do what is needed in front of you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1240">Sweet Mother, I indeed suspect that you want to endure, to bear this struggle all alone. Oh, I think I understand a number of things about the mechanism of these attacks and their connection with me, about the Divine Love that embraces all and takes into itself the suffering and the evil of men ‚Äì all this overwhelms me with a sudden understanding. It seems to me that I am seeing and feeling all that you are facing, all that you are taking upon yourself for us. The suffering of the Divine in Matter has been an overwhelming revelation to me ‚Äì Ah! I see, I want to fight, I want to be totally on your side; I am now and forever <em>determined</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1241">But you have enough to do with the higher beasts of prey without still having to fight the little scorpions. I beg of you, Sweet Mother, accept the help that is being offered to you, preserve your strength for the higher struggle. I quite understand that your Love can even go to the scorpions that are attacking you, but it is not forbidden to protect yourself from their venom. You have enough to do on other planes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1242">X is at the summit of tantric initiation, and his power is not the fruit of a simple knowledge. He holds it directly from the Divine, and these things have been in his family traditionally from ten generations. <em>No</em> black magic can resist his power. His action is not brutal, he does not mechanically apply formulas, he holds this Science and knows how to apply it like an expert chemist, always in Light, Love and sweetness. If you agree that he come to see you, he will immediately know the source of these attacks upon you and will even be able to make the attacking force speak. He has this power. Of course, neither X nor Swami will divulge</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page261">Page 261</p>
<p class="PE"> this to anyone, and everything will be kept secret. You have only to send word, or a telegram: ‚ÄúNo objection.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1243">The work can be done from here also, but naturally it will not be quite as effective. In that case, you would have to set a specific time to synchronize the action in Rameswaram and Pondicherry. Swami can also do something in his pujas. It is for you to decide, but I hope you will not want to prolong this battle unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1244">On my side, within my little field, I am taking the bull by the horns and henceforth the enemy will no longer have my complicity. May all my being be turned solely towards your Light ‚Äì and be your help, your instrument, your knight.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1245">X has decided to continue his action upon me beyond the eight days foreseen, which doubtlessly corresponds to dosages that exceed my understanding.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1246">Mother, I am fighting beside you, for you, for your Victory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1247">With all my Love, I am at your feet.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>Signed:</em> Satprem</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1248">It seems to me that everything has changed since I have understood that it is not a personal battle, and that I can <em>serve</em>. Your grace is everywhere, everywhere.</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>(Mother's reply)</em></p>
<p class="Q"><a name="1958-12-30">Sri Aurobindo Ashram, 12.30.58</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1249">My dear child,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1250">I have just now received your letter of the 28th. On that day I definitely felt that there was a decisive change in the situation and I understood right away that you had spoken to Swami and also that what I had written to you gave you the opportunity to take a great step. I am very happy and can say with certitude that the worst is over. However, from several points of view, I infinitely appreciate X's offer. And although I do not think it necessary, or even desirable, that they both come here (it would create a veritable revolution and perhaps even a panic among the ashramites), I am sure that their intervention in Rameswaram itself would not only be useful but most effective...</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page262">Page 262</p>
<p class="PE"> Yes, everything has changed since you now understand that your battle is not only a personal battle and that by winning it, it is a real service you are rendering to the Divine Work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1251">Happy New Year, my dear child! I am sure it will bring us a decisive victory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1252">I am near you with all my love.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>Signed:</em> Mother</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1253">P.S. I shall propose to Swami to enter into contact with them at 8:45 p.m., if this time suits them.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Rameswaram, January 6, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1254">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1255">This is to tell you that a knot has very perceptibly come undone in me, for no apparent reason; suddenly, I was breathing easily.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1256">And it happened just as I was despairing of ever getting out of it. I seemed to be touching a kind of fundamental bedrock, so painful, so suffering, and full of revolt because of too much suffering. And I saw that all my efforts, all the meditations, aspirations, mantras, were only covering up this suffering bedrock without touching it. I saw this fundamental thing in me very clearly, a poignant knot, ever ready for an absolute negation. I saw it and I said to you, ‚ÄúMother, only your grace can remove this.‚Äù I said this to you in the temple that morning, in total despair. And then, the knot was undone. X's action contributed a lot, with your grace acting through him. But truly, I have traversed a veritable hell this last while.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1257">X continues his work on me daily; it is to last 41 days in all. He told me that he wants to undo the things of several births. When it is over, he will explain it all to me. I do not know how to tell you how luminous and good this man is, he is a very great soul. He is also giving me Sanskrit lessons, and little by little, each evening, speaks to me of the Tantra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1258">His action upon you is to continue for another five days, after which he is positive that you will be entirely saved. According to him, it is indeed a magic attack originating in Pondicherry, and perhaps even from someone in the Ashram!! He told me that this evil person would finally be forced to appear before you... I am learning many interesting things from him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1259">Mother, by way of expressing to you my gratitude, I want to work now to open myself totally to your Light and become truly an egoless instrument, your conscious instrument. Mother, you are the sole Reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1260">With love and gratitude, I am your child.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1261">My dear child,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1262">I was awaiting your letter impatiently and am very happy about what you write!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1263">I have followed the vicissitudes of your struggle step by step and I know that it has been terrible, but my confidence in the outcome has not wavered ‚Äì for I know you are in good hands. I am so happy that X is taking good care of you, teaching you Sanskrit, speaking to you of the Tantra. It is just what I wanted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1264">His action here has been very effective and really very interesting. I still do not know whether someone has really done black magic, and the ‚Äúvillain‚Äù has yet to appear before me. But already several days ago the malefic influence completely disappeared without leaving any trace in the atmosphere. Also their mantric intervention did not stop at that, for it has had another most interesting result. I am preparing a long letter for Swami to explain all this to him...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1265">The pain on the left side has not entirely gone and there have been some complications which have delayed things. But I feel much better. In fact, I am rebuilding my health, and I am in no hurry to resume the exhausting days as before. It is quiet upstairs for working, and I am going to take advantage of this to prepare the <em>Bulletin</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="114" href="#">1</a> at leisure. As I had not read over the pages on the message that we had prepared for the 31<sup>st</sup>, I have revised and transformed them into an article. It will be the first one in the February issue. I am now going to choose the others. I will tell you which ones I have chosen and in what order I will put them.</p>

<p class="Q">Rameswaram, January 14, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1267">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1268">This morning, X told me that he would be most happy to continue his action upon you if it would help your work; he has continued it anyway, even after knowing that the malefic influence was expelled from the Ashram. By the way, X told me that this evil spirit is continuing to circle around the Ashram, but beyond its ‚Äúborders.‚Äù Therefore, if you agree, it would be necessary for him to come to Pondicherry one of these days to come to grips directly with the ‚Äúevil one‚Äù and finish him off in such a way that he can no longer come to disturb the sadhaks, or your work, upon the slightest pretext. Then X could force this spirit to appear before him, and thereby free the atmosphere from its influence. Anyway, this trip to Pondicherry would not take place in the near future, and it would be easy to give him an official excuse: seminars on the Tantra Shastra that will interest all the Sanskritists at the Ashram. Moreover, X's work would be done quietly in his room when he does his daily puja. From here, from Rameswaram, it is rather difficult to attract Pondicherry's atmosphere and do the work with precision. Of course, nothing will be done without your express consent. Swami is writing you on his own to tell you of the revelation that X received from his [deceased] guru concerning your experience and the schemings of certain Ashram members.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1269">In this regard, perhaps you know that X is the tenth in the line of Bhaskaraya (my spelling of this name is perhaps not correct), the great Tantric of whom you had a vision, who could command the coming of Kali along with all her warriors. It is from X that Swami received his initiation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1270">Your last letter gave us great pleasure, knowing that you have finally recovered physically. But we deeply hope that you will not again take up the countless activities that formerly consumed all your time ‚Äì so many people come to you egoistically, for prestige, to be able to say that they are on familiar terms with you. You know this, of course...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1271">As for myself, a step has definitely been taken, and I am no</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page271">Page 271</p>
<p class="PE"> longer swept away by this painful torrent. Depressions and attacks still come, but no longer with the same violence as before. X told me that 2/3 of the work has been done and that everything would be purged in twelve days or so, then the ‚Äúthing‚Äù will be enclosed in a jar and buried somewhere or thrown into the sea, and he will explain it all to me. I will write and tell you about it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1272">As for the true tantric initiation, this is what X told me: <em>‚ÄúI will give you initiation. You are fit. You belong to that line. It will come soon, some months or some years. Shortly you shall reach the junction. When the time has come, you yourself will come and open a door in me and I shall give you initiation.‚Äù</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="115-1" href="#">1</a> And he made me understand that an important divine work was reserved for me in the future, a work for the Mother. The important practical point is that I have rapidly to develop my knowledge of Sanskrit. The mantra given to me seems to grow in power as I repeat it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1273">Sweet Mother, by what Grace have you guided and protected me through all these years? There are moments when I have the <em>vision</em> of this Grace, bringing me to the verge of tears. I see so clearly that you are doing everything, that you are all that is good in me, my aspiration and my strength. ‚ÄúMe‚Äù is all that is bad, all that resists, ‚Äúme‚Äù is horribly false and falsifying. If your Grace withdraws for one second, I collapse, I am <em>helpless</em>.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="115" href="#">2</a> You alone are my strength, the source of my life, the joy and fulfillment to which I aspire.</p>

It was my feeling, I could say my conviction, to which he gives an enlightened confirmation. So all is well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1277">As for my health and the Ashram, I <em>infinitely</em> appreciate what he has done and what he would like to continue to do. His visit will make me very happy, and if he comes in about one month, a few days before the ‚Äúdarshan,‚Äù there will be no need to find any excuse for his visit, for it will appear quite natural.</p>

My guru told me that your present difficulties are a period of testing, but I could already give you the first stage of tantric initiation and that for you, the three stages of initiation</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page273">Page 273</p>
<p class="PE"> could be done in an accelerated way. I will therefore give you initiation this Friday or Saturday, on the day of the full moon or the day before. This first stage will last three months during which you will have to repeat 1 lakh<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="118" href="#">2</a> times the mantra that I will give you. At the end of three months, I will come to see you in Pondicherry ‚Äì or you will come here for a fortnight, and as soon as I have received the message from my guru, I will give you the second stage that will last three months as well. At the end of these three months, you will receive the full initiation.‚Äù X warned me that the first stage I am to receive provokes attacks and tests but that all this disappears with the second stage. Forewarned is forearmed. For what reason I do not know, but X told me that the particular nature of my initiation should remain secret and that he will say nothing about it to Swami, and he added (in speaking of the speed of the process), <em>‚ÄúBut you will not be less than the Swami</em>.‚Äù (!!) There, I wanted you to know ‚Äì besides, you were present in X's vision. All this happened at a time when I was in the most desperate crisis I have ever known. Sweet Mother, there is no end to expressing my gratitude to you, and yet with the least trial, I am reduced to nothing. Why have you so much grace for me?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1293">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1294">So X will to do a special work for you for eleven days, and if at the end of this period the suffering still persists, he will send me to Pondicherry to deliver something directly into your hands. I, too, would like very much to do something to alleviate your suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1295">By a special grace, X gave me both stages of the tantric initiation at the same time, although they are normally separated by several years; then if all goes well, he will give me the full initiation in 6 months. I have thus received a mantra, along with the power of realizing it. X told me that a realization should come <em>at the beginning of the fifth month</em> if I repeat the mantra strictly according to his instructions, but he again told me that the hostile forces would do all they could to prevent me from saying my mantra: mental suggestions and even illness. X has understood that I have work at the Ashram, and he has exempted me from the outer forms (pujas and other rituals), but nevertheless I must repeat my mantra very accurately every day (3,333 times, that is, a little more than 3 hours uninterrupted in the mornings, and more than 2 hours in the evening). I must therefore organize myself in such a way as to get up very early in the morning in Pondicherry, for <em>in no case</em> will your work suffer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1296">Apart from this, he has not yet entirely finished the work of ‚Äúpurging‚Äù that he has been doing on me for over a month, but I believe that everything will be completed in a short time from now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1297">Sweet Mother, I have a kind of fear that all these mantras are not bringing me nearer to you ‚Äì I mean you in your physical body, for it is not upon you physically that I was told to concentrate. Also, I almost never see you in my dreams any longer, or else only very vaguely. Last night, I dreamed that I was offering you flowers (not very pretty ones), one of which was called ‚Äúmantra,‚Äù but I did not see you in my dream. Mother, I would like to be true, to do the right thing, to be as you want me to be.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1301">All is well ‚Äì I am enthusiastic and you can count on my conscious help to overcome all the obstacles and all the bad will that may try to stop or delay your progress.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1302">Since my last letter, I have thought about it and I see that I will be able to go down in the morning three times a week for one hour, from 10 to 11, to work with you, but you will have to do only the strict minimum in order to have as much free time as you need for the other things.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="121" href="#">1</a></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1304">My body would also like to have a mantra to repeat. Those it has are not enough for it anymore. It would like to have one to hasten its transformation. It is ready to repeat it as many times as needed, provided that it does not have to be out loud, for it is very rarely alone and does not want to speak of this to anyone. Truly, the Ashram atmosphere is not very favorable for this kind of thing. You will have to take precautions so as not to be disturbed or interrupted in an inopportune way. Domestic servants, curious people, so-called friends can all serve as instruments of the hostile forces to put a spoke in the wheels. I will do my best to protect you, but you will have a lot to do yourself and will have to be as firm as an iron rod.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1305">I am not writing you all this to discourage you from coming. But <em>I want you to succeed;</em> for me that is more important than anything else, no matter what the price. So, know for certain that I am with you all the time and more so especially when you repeat your mantra...</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Rameswaram, January 31, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1307">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1308">I have reflected for a long time on that passage in your letter where you say that your body needs a mantra to hasten its transformation. Certainly X can do something in this realm, but I have not yet spoken to him (and I shall not speak of this to Swami).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1309">X knows very little about your true work and what Swami has been able to explain to him is rather inadequate, for I do not believe that he himself understands it very well. So I shall have to try to make myself understood quite clearly to X and tell him exactly and simply what it is you need. The word ‚Äútransformation‚Äù is too abstract. Each mantra has a very specific action ‚Äì at least I believe so ‚Äì and I must be able to tell X in a concrete way the exact powers or capacities you are now seeking, and the general goal or the particular results required. Then he will find the mantra or mantras that apply.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1310">My explanations will have to be simple, for X speaks English with difficulty, thus subtleties are out of the question. (I am teaching him a little English while he is teaching me Sanskrit, and we manage to understand each other rather well all the same. He understands more than he can speak.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1311">I do not want to mention this to Swami, as X is not very happy about the way Swami seizes upon every occasion to appropriate things, and particularly mantras (I will explain this to you when we meet again). It is especially the way he says ‚ÄúI‚Äù. Nothing very serious ‚Äì it is Swami's bad side, though he has good ones too. You know that, however.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1312">So I would like to speak to X knowledgeably, in a very precise way, and I am waiting only for you to tell me what I should say. The thing is too important to be approached lightly and vaguely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1313">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1314">As for my return to Pondicherry, I would like you yourself to decide. I am anxious to see you again, but I also think that it is not necessary to rush things, and the Darshan periods are heavy for you.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page278">Page 278</p>
<p class="PE"> In principle, X will have finished his ‚Äúpurging‚Äù of me on February 6. So after that date I will do what you wish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1315">As for my mantra, I say it only partially now, but X will fix an ‚Äúauspicious‚Äù day to begin it really according to the rules when I am in Pondicherry, for theoretically, one should not move once the work has begun. The 12th of February is an auspicious day, if you decide that I should return by then (or a little before to get things ready); otherwise another date may be fixed later on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1316">Your letter, Sweet Mother, has filled me with strength and resolution. I want to be victorious and I want to serve you. I see very well that gradually I can be taught many useful things by X. The essential thing is first of all to lose this ego which falsifies everything. Finally, through your grace, I believe that I have passed a decisive turning point and that there is a beginning of real consecration ‚Äì and I feel your Love, your Presence. Things are opening a little.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1327">I spent a night ‚Äì a night of battle ‚Äì when, for some reason or other, a multitude of vital formations of all kinds entered into the room: beings, things, embryos of beings, residues of beings ‚Äì all kinds of things... And it was a frightful assault, absolutely disgusting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1328">In this swarming mass, I noticed the presence of some slightly more conscious wills ‚Äì wills of the vital plane ‚Äì and I saw how they try to awaken a reaction in the consciousness of human beings to make them think or want, or if possible, do certain things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1329">For example, I saw one of them trying to incite anger in someone so that this person would deliver a blow ‚Äì a spiritual blow. And this formation had a dagger in his hand (a vital dagger, you see, it was a vital being: gray and slimy, horrible), he was holding a very sharp dagger which he was flaunting, saying, ‚ÄúWhen a person has done something like that (pretending that someone had done an unforgivable thing), this is what he deserves...‚Äù and the scenario was complete: the being rushed forward, vitally, with his dagger.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1330">I, who know the consequences of these things, stopped him just in time ‚Äì I gave him a blow. Then I had enough of all this and</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page280">Page 280</p>
<p class="PE"> it was over, I cleaned the place out. It was almost a physical cleaning, for I had my hands clasped together (I was in a semitrance) and I threw them apart in an abrupt movement, left and right, powerfully, as if to sweep something away, and frrt!... immediately everything was gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1331">But had that not happened... I was watching, not exactly with curiosity, but in order to learn ‚Äì to learn what kind of atmosphere people live in! And it is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS</span> like that! They are always pestered by <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HORDES</span> of little formations that are absolutely swarming and disgusting, each one making its... nasty little suggestion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1332">Take these movements of anger, for example, when someone is carried away by his passion and does things which, in his normal state, he would never do: <em>he is</em> not doing it, it is done by these little formations which are there, swarming in the atmosphere, just waiting for an occasion... to rush in.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1333">When you see them, oh! it's... suffocating. When you're in contact with that... Really, you wonder how anyone can breathe in such an atmosphere. And yet people <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANTLY</span> live in that atmosphere! They live in it. Only when they rise above are they <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> in it. Or else there are those who are entirely below; but those are the toys of these things, and their reactions are sometimes not only unexpected but absolutely dreadful ‚Äì because they are puppets in the hands of these things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1334">Those who rise above, who enter into a slightly intellectual region, can see all this from above; they can look down at it all, keep their heads above and breathe; but those who live in this realm...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1335">Sri Aurobindo calls this realm the ‚Äúintermediate zone,‚Äù a zone in which, he says, you can have all the experiences you wish if you enter into it.

I had that experience because I had just read what Sri Aurobindo says on this subject in a letter in this latest book, <em>On Yoga; I</em> wanted to see for myself what it was. Ah, I understood!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1336">And I express this in my own way when I say<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="128" href="#">1</a> that thoughts ‚Äúcome and go, flow in and out.‚Äù But thoughts concerning material things are formations originating in that world, they are kinds of wills coming from the vital plane which try to express themselves, and most often they are truly deadly. If you are annoyed, for example, if someone says something unpleasant to you and you react... It always happens in the same way; these little entities</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page281">Page 281</p>
<p class="PE"> are there waiting, and when they feel it's the right moment, they introduce their influence and their suggestions. This is what is vitally symbolized by the being with his dagger rushing forward to stab you ‚Äì and in the back, at that! Not even face to face! This then expresses itself in the human consciousness by a movement of anger or rage or indignation: ‚ÄúHow intolerable! How...!‚Äù And the other fellow says, ‚ÄúYes! We shall put an end to it!‚Äù</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Pondicherry</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1338">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1339">X has just left my house. He began by saying that he had your permission to speak to me about certain things concerning the black forces that attacked you. I asked him why he did not speak to you directly, because surely you would understand better and <em>more</em> than I. He replied in this way: <em>‚ÄúSeveral times Mother asked about these black powers, and every time I felt in myself a ‚Äògreat confusion.‚Äô There (in your room) it is such a Place, Place of supreme Power, Place of Divinity, and I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> talk about small matters. I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> talk English. I have tried but it disturbs my ‚Äòmeditation.‚Äô Thus I have asked Mother permission to talk to you; with you I can talk of these matters</em>.‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="122" href="#">1</a> These were almost exactly his words. Sweet Mother, he said this in such a way, there was something so <em>sacred</em> when he spoke of you up in your room, that I felt like prostrating myself at his feet. (Ah, Sweet Mother, how inadequately we approach you!...)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1340">He began his story thus: ‚ÄúThis girl in Mother's entourage<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="123" href="#">2</a> was,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page282">Page 282</p>
<p class="PE"> while she was alive, attacked by an extremely powerful mantric magician. But the Protection was there, and finally the attack fell back on the mantric, who died from it. He died in a great rage and with a great will for revenge and began circling around the Ashram in the <em>Preta Loka</em> (I believe this corresponds to the vital world) seeking an opportunity to do harm, but there was such a purity, such a divine force that he could do nothing. When this girl died, he attacked her, and the two merged ‚Äì he absorbed her. Then they continued wandering about the Ashram in search of a physical instrument to gain entry into the Ashram. They found an entryway through the intermediary of certain <em>black-minded people</em>. While doing my Puja, I <em>came to know seven of them</em>. All seven came, drawn by my Yantra.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="124" href="#">3</a> Some of them are <em>people who have</em> taken Mother's money and have <em>been collecting money from their duty</em>. I learned this yesterday, and I began a special Puja to <em>turn their mind, put them again on the right path.‚Äù</em> (At this point, he said something that meant this would be easy.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1341">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1342">Thereupon, X told me, ‚ÄúThat is all. I will tell you more on Friday, after the Puja. The work will be over.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1343">Here, the conversation on this subject came to an end.

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem concerning X's inquiry into who had practiced black magic on her)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Pondicherry</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1349">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1350">I will be seeing you tomorrow, but I prefer to state things clearly now; if you wish, I can read you my letter when we meet. Here is what X told me:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1351">‚ÄúThe message came this morning during the Puja; my guru spoke in the form of Sanskrit slokas and this is not easy to express in English. Normally, I might have waited rather long for the answer, but because of the greatness of the Mother, it came immediately. The message implicated not 7 people, but 25 to 50, all or almost all Gujaratis.‚Äù (Here, X said something I am not sure I grasped, but it was to the effect that either his guru did not seem to find it easy or did not feel like giving so many names, but were Mother to insist, it might be possible. I am not sure if I really understood this.) Then the message spoke of a rivalry between the Gujaratis and the Bengalis (to occupy the key positions in the Ashram); I put this in parentheses for it is more an interpretation on my part, what I ‚Äúfelt.‚Äù Moreover, X did not exactly use the word ‚Äúrivalry‚Äù ‚Äì which he probably doesn't know ‚Äì but rather <em>‚Äúconfusion between Gujarati and Bengali.‚Äù</em> However, the message explicitly implicated the Gujaratis of the <em>‚ÄúHead-departments.‚Äù</em> I then asked X if he meant the <em>heads</em> of departments or the main departments. He answered, <em>‚ÄúAll Gujaratis,‚Äù</em> whereupon he caught</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page284">Page 284</p>
<p class="PE"> himself and said, ‚Äú75% of them.‚Äù At this point X told me, <em>‚ÄúIn the Ashram there are few, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FEW</span> people on a very high level, and plenty...‚Äù</em> without completing his sentence. The message continued, stating explicitly that these Gujaratis are busy making money from Mother <em>(‚Äúmaking collection of money‚Äù)</em>, while outwardly pretending to be serving the Ashram. Here, I thought I understood that there was a Bengali group which was seeking to overthrow the Gujaratis so that they could manage the business affairs as they please. Such was the substance of the message. I asked X if he could not write down the very concise Sanskrit slokas he had heard. He said yes, then he said that he would see about this after going to his house???</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1352">Then, X told me that he was going to do something to straighten all this out and to <em>‚Äúturn the mind of those people in the right path</em>. But I cannot do it here, in Pondicherry. About two months will be needed. For two months, I will do a Puja on a special Yantra and when it is finished, I will send Mother this Yantra along with certain manuscripts for the library. Then Mother will have to keep this Yantra beside her to control all these bad elements, and it will help her, her own work.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1353">I asked X for details on at least those who had paid the magician. He told me he would speak about it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1354">Finally, I read your letter to X. Regarding the globe of light, he at once said, ‚ÄúI know; it is Mother's Shakti, her Power in a concentrated form (he did not use the word ‚Äòconcentrated,‚Äô but said ‚Äòcollection‚Äô). This global, concentrated Shakti came back today; it is a very good sign.‚Äù Then he said something that meant it was a sign that <em>‚Äúthe black Power‚Äù</em> was definitely conquered or controlled. (I will speak to you of a strange dream that I had last night, which seems related to this.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="125" href="#">1</a>) ‚ÄúThe Shakti had been dispersed by the black attack, but its Light was too powerful to be really touched. It has come back. Also, I saw from certain physical signs that Mother is better.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1355">Then X expressed the desire to meditate <em>sitting</em> in front of you and not standing: <em>‚ÄúYou see, this morning I was flying, I was not touching the floor ‚Äì outside of the body.‚Äù</em> So he would be more comfortable sitting. Then he added, <em>‚ÄúEvery day a different action takes place. Mother knows, but I can tell you a little something</em></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page285">Page 285</p>
<p class="PE"> <em>because you are very close to me, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">YOU ARE MY HEART</span></em> (I was deeply touched when he told me that). <em>The first day my guruji was standing there, by my side, with his hand on my shoulder, blessing me. Another day I was growing, growing 10 feet instead of 5, and great, great Power came in me.‚Äù</em> This is approximate, I no longer remember exactly how he said it. All I know is that something very powerful came into him and afterwards he needed to rest. He did not elaborate, but only repeated, <em>‚ÄúMother knows.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1356">So that is about all, Sweet Mother.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1357">Each time he comes to see me, he ‚Äútransmits‚Äù something to me: there is a great force trying to go out of me which he seems to be pulling; it tries to climb up through the neck and to go out from the head. I don't know exactly. Something is happening, that is all I know.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1379">This Titan has been specially sent to attack this body, but he can't do it directly, so he uses people in my entourage.

<p class="PE"> get any very clear explanation. X is well acquainted with this Light ‚Äì these luminous bluish-violet waves with the white bar running through the center. He gave me his own description, which coincides exactly with yours... In short, he wanted to say that perhaps this Light was the result of his concentrating upon you, even when he is in Rameswaram. I spoke to him of the universalization of your body. He nodded, like someone who understands, but without making any comment. As for the orange globe, this is what he said: <em>‚ÄúEvery time, before meditation with Mother, I utter some letters. And as you know, each letter has a color. There are 51 ways to combine letters, and there are 51 ‚Äòpaths,‚Äô or 51 places in the body where the force can act. Thus the orange globe is probably the effect of some letters; it may be some protection for her body.‚Äù</em> In any case, he seemed to find it quite normal that your experiences of this bluish-violet light began approximately at the same time as your relationship, and in all the pujas there are these ‚Äúdiagrams‚Äù or ‚ÄúYantras‚Äù that always have geometric forms.

<p class="PE"> When you follow the ascending path, the work is relatively easy. I had already covered this path by the beginning of the century and had established a constant relationship with the Supreme ‚Äì That which is beyond the Personal and the gods and all the outward expressions of the Divine, but also beyond the Absolute Impersonal. It's something you cannot describe; you must experience it. And this is what must be brought down into Matter. Such is the descending path, the one I began with Sri Aurobindo; and there, the work is immense.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1454">The thing can still be brought down as far as the mental and vital planes (although Sri Aurobindo said that thousands of lifetimes would be needed merely to bring it down to the mental plane, unless one practiced a perfect <em>surrender</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="137" href="#">1</a>). With Sri Aurobindo, we went down below Matter, right into the Subconscient and even into the Inconscient. But after the descent comes the transformation, and when you come down to the body, when you attempt to make it take one step forward ‚Äì oh, not even a real step, just a little step! ‚Äì everything starts grating; it's like stepping on an anthill... And yet the presence, the help of the supreme Mother, is there constantly; thus you realize that for ordinary men such a task is impossible, or else millions of lives would be needed ‚Äì but in truth, unless the work is done for them and the sadhana of the body done for the entire earth consciousness, they will never achieve the physical transformation, or else it will be so remote that it is better not even to speak of it. But if they open themselves, if they give themselves over in an integral <em>surrender</em>, the work can be done for them ‚Äì they have only to let it be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1455">The path is difficult. And yet this body is full of good will; it is filled with the psychic in every one of its cells. It's like a child. The other day, it cried out quite spontaneously, ‚ÄúO my Sweet Lord, give me the time to realize You!‚Äù It did not ask to hasten the process, it did not ask to lighten its work; it only asked for enough <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TIME</span> to do the work. ‚ÄúGive me the time!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1456">I could have begun this work on the body thirty years ago, but I was constantly caught up in this harassing ashram life. It took</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page302">Page 302</p>
<p class="PE"> this illness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="138" href="#">2</a> to enable me truly to begin doing the sadhana of the body. It does not mean that thirty years were wasted, for it is likely that had I been able to start this work thirty years ago, it would have been premature. The consciousness of the others also had to develop ‚Äì the two are linked, the individual progress and the collective progress, and one cannot advance if the other does not advance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1457">I have also come to realize that for this sadhana of the body, the mantra is essential. Sri Aurobindo gave none; he said that one should be able to do all the work without having to resort to external means. Had he reached the point where we are now, he would have seen that the purely psychological method is inadequate and that a japa is necessary, because only japa has a direct action on the body. So I had to find the method all alone, to find my mantra by myself. But now that things are ready, I have done ten years of work in a few months. That is the difficulty, it requires time...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1458">And I repeat my mantra constantly ‚Äì when I am awake and even when I sleep. I say it even when I am getting dressed, when I eat, when I work, when I speak with others; it is there, just behind in the background, all the time, all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1459">In fact, you can immediately see the difference between those who have a mantra and those who don't. With those who have no mantra, even if they have a strong habit of meditation or concentration, something around them remains hazy and vague. Whereas the japa imparts to those who practice it a kind of precision, a kind of solidity: an armature. They become galvanized, as it were.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Pondicherry, May 28, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1486">Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1487">I do not want you to suffer because of me, for there is already too much suffering in this world. I shall do what you wish. I will go to Rameswaram and I will stay there as long as X wants. I have <em>seen</em> that there is no happy solution. So I bow before the circumstances.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page306">Page 306</p>
<p class="PE"> If it is not too tiring for your eyes, I would like you to read what follows. I want to tell you what I have seen, very clearly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1488">After the wave of rebelliousness this morning, I was seized by a great sadness, a great bitterness, as though I were being confronted with a profound injustice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1489">There is a spiritual destiny in me, but there are <em>three</em> other destinies so intimately bound up with it that I cannot cut off any one without mutilating something of my living soul ‚Äì which is why, periodically, these suppressed destinies awaken and call to me ‚Äì and the dark forces seize upon these occasions to sow chaos within and drive me to ruin everything since I cannot really fulfill myself. And the problem is insoluble.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1490">1) There is the destiny of the adventurer: it is the one in me that needs the sea or the forest and wide open spaces and struggles. This was the best part of my childhood. I can sit on it and tell myself that ‚Äúthe adventure is within,‚Äù and it might ‚Äúwork‚Äù for a while. But this untamed child in me continues to live all the same, and it is something very valuable in me. I cannot kill it through reasoning, even spiritual reasoning. And if I tell it that everything lies ‚Äúwithin,‚Äù not ‚Äúwithout,‚Äù it replies, ‚ÄúThen why was I born, why this manifestation in the outer world?‚Äù In the end, it is not a question of reasoning. It is a fact, like the wind upon the heaths.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1491">2) There is the destiny of the writer in me. And this too is linked to the best of my soul. It is also a profound need, like adventuring upon the heaths, because when I write certain things, I breathe in a certain way. But during the five years I have been here, I have had to bow to the fact that, materially, there is no time to write what I would like (I recall how I had to wrench out this <em>Orpailleur</em>, which I have not even had time to revise). This is not a reproach, Mother, for you do all you can to help me. But I realize that to write, one must have <em>leisure</em>, and there are <em>too many</em> less personal and more serious things to do. So I can also sit on this and tell myself that I am going to write a ‚ÄúSri Aurobindo‚Äù ‚Äì but this will not satisfy that other need in me, and periodically it awakens and sprouts up to tell me that it too needs to breathe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1492">3) There is also the destiny that feels human love as something divine, something that can be transfigured and become a very powerful driving force. I did not believe it possible, except in dreams, until the day I met someone here. But you do not believe in these things, so I shall not speak of it further. I can gag this also and tell myself that one day all will be filled in the inner</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page307">Page 307</p>
<p class="PE"> divine love. But that does not prevent this other need in me from living and from finding that life is dry and from saying, ‚ÄúWhy this outer manifestation if all life is in the inner realms?‚Äù But neither can I stifle this with reasoning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1493">So there remains the pure spiritual destiny, pure interiorization. That is what I have been trying to do for the last five years, without much success. There are good periods of collaboration, because one part of my being can be happy in any condition. But in a certain way this achievement remains truncated, especially when you base spiritual life on a principle of integrality. And these three destinies in me have their own good reasons, which are true: they are not inferior, they are not incidental, they are woven from the very threads that created the spiritual life in me. My error is to open the door to revolt when I feel too poignantly one or the other being stifled.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1494">So you see, all this is <em>insoluble</em>. I have only to bow before these unfortunate circumstances. I perceive an injustice somewhere, but I have only to remain silent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1495">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1496">And I was also struck when you told me that I wanted to ‚Äúkick up a row.‚Äù You so clearly implied that I was leaving the Ashram in a ‚Äúshoddy‚Äù way. So that also froze me. I thought I had done my best and, in order to serve you, repressed as much as I could the others in me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1497">So there. I can find no solution. X will not understand, and I will not say anything to him. But I obey you because everything is futile and there is too much pain in this world, and also someone in me <em>needs you</em>, someone who loves you in his own way.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1499">I have read your letter in its entirety and I remain convinced that one day all the parts of your being, without excluding any, will be fully satisfied. But we shall see about that later.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Note from Mother to Satprem)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1503">I did not utter the words that you heard ‚Äì I wanted to speak to you of my experience during the night, but I was paralyzed because I clearly felt that you no longer understood me. As soon as I received your letter, I concentrated on you in an effort to help you, and when night fell, just at the hour I enter into contact with X, I called for his help ‚Äì whereupon he sent me this little Kali whom he had already sent once before. So I went to your house, I took you in my arms and pressed you tightly to my heart to keep you as sheltered as possible from blows, and I let Kali do her warrior dance against this titan who is always trying to possess you, creating this rebelliousness in you. She must have at least partially succeeded in her work, because very early in the morning the titan went away somewhat discomfited, but while leaving, he flung this at me as he went by: ‚ÄúYou will regret it, for you would have had less trouble if he had left.‚Äù I flung his suggestion back in his face with a laugh and told him, ‚ÄúTake that, along with all the rest of your ugly person! I have no need of it!‚Äù And the atmosphere cleared up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1504">I wanted to tell you all this, but I couldn't because you were still far away from me and it would have seemed like boasting. Also the misunderstanding created by the distance made you hear other words than those I uttered.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Letter to Mother from Satprem, while travelling)</em></p>
<p class="Q">Rameswaram, June 3, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1505">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1506">On your behalf, I told X that you had been worried about me.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page309">Page 309</p>
<p class="PE"> He, too, had felt that things were not going well and had ‚Äúworked‚Äù on his side. He told me to write you immediately to tell you that <em>‚Äúeverything is all right.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1507">............</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1508">Also, I explained to him that a mantra had come to you which you were repeating between 5 and 6 in particular, and I told him about this culminating point where you wanted to express your gratitude, enthusiasm, etc., and about the French mantra. After explaining, I gave him your French and Sanskrit texts. He <em>felt</em> and understood very well what you wanted. His first reaction after reading it was to say, <em>‚ÄúGreat meaning, great power is there. It is all right</em>.‚Äù I told him that apart from the meaning of the mantra, you wanted to know if it was all right from the ‚Äúvibrational‚Äù standpoint. He told me that he would take your text to his next puja and would repeat it himself to see. He should have done that this morning, but he has a fever (since his return from Madurai, he has not been well because of a cold and sunstroke). I will write you as soon as I know the result of his ‚Äútest.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1509">Regarding me, this is more or less what he said: <em>‚ÄúFirst of all, I want an agreement from you so that under any circumstances you never leave the Ashram. Whatever happens, even if Yama<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="140" href="#">1</a> comes to dance at your door, you should never leave the Ashram. At the critical moment, when the attack is the strongest, you should throw everything into His hands, then and then only the thing can be removed‚Äù (I</em> no longer know whether he said ‚Äúremoved‚Äù or 
‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù). <em>It is the only way. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SARVAM MAMA BRAHMAN</span></em> [Thou art my sole refuge]. <em>Here in Rameswaram, we are going to meditate together for 45 days, and the Asuric-Shakti may come with full strength to attack, and I shall try my best not only to protect but to destroy, but for that, I need your determination. It is only by your own determination that I can get strength. If the force comes to make suggestions: lack of adventure, lack of Nature, lack of love, then think that I am the forest, think that I am the sea, think that I am the wife (!!)‚Äù</em> Meanwhile, X has nearly doubled the number of repetitions of the mantra that I have to say every day (it is the same mantra he gave me in Pondicherry). X repeated to me again and again that I am not merely a ‚Äúdisciple‚Äù to him, like the others, but as if his son.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1510">This was a first, hasty conversation, and we did not discuss things at length. I said nothing. I have no confidence in my</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page310">Page 310</p>
<p class="PE"> reactions when I am in the midst of my crises of complete negation. And truly speaking, at the time of my last crisis in Pondicherry, I do not know if it was really X's occult working that set things right, for personally (but perhaps it is an ignorant impression), I felt that it was thanks to Sujata and her childlike simplicity that I was able to get out of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1511">In any event, since I left Pondicherry, I have been living like a kind of robot (it began in the train); I am empty, void of the least feeling for whomever it may be. I keep going by a kind of acquired momentum, but actually I feel completely anaesthetized.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1512">Excuse my handwriting. I am writing to you lying on the floor of the dharamshala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="141" href="#">2</a> near X's house, for the ‚Äúhut‚Äù meant for me is not yet ready.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1513">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1514">Suddenly, last evening, X went furiously on the warpath against the Indian ‚ÄúCongress‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="142" href="#">3</a> and with an irrefutable tone, like someone who knows, began making very interesting predictions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1515">Before five months are over (in September, October or November), Pakistan will attack India with the help or the complicity or the military resources of the United States. And at about the same time, China will attack India because of the Dalai Lama, under the pretext that India is supporting the Dalai Lama and that thousands of Tibetan refugees are escaping into India to carry on anti-Chinese activities. Then America will offer its support to India against China and then, said X, ‚ÄúWe shall see what will be the political policy of the Congress Party, which pretends to be unaligned with any bloc. If India accepts American aid, there will be no more Pakistan but rather American troops to prevent conflicts between Muslims and Hindus, and a single government for both countries.‚Äù I pointed out to X that this sounded very much like a world war...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1516">Then he made the following comparison: ‚ÄúWhen you throw a pebble into a pond, there is just one center, one point where it falls, and everything radiates out from this center. There are two such centers in the world at present, two places where there are great vibrations: one is India and Pakistan, and that will radiate all over Asia. And the other is...‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1517">In any case, I had never heard him attacking the Congress as he</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page311">Page 311</p>
<p class="PE"> did yesterday evening, almost violently.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1518">That is all, Sweet Mother. In spite of my anaesthesia, I think of you. (I am not blocked; on the contrary, it seems to me that the bond has been renewed since our last meeting, but I feel strangely empty.) I am unable to understand how you can love me.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1521">As for the Sanskrit text and the mantra, I await your next letter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1522">For you, I fully approve of what he told you. Fervently, and with all my love, I pray that he will succeed in what he wants to do during these 45 days of meditation. This is really what I was counting on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1523">For what occurred here, I can say only one thing: when the Supreme Lord wants to save someone, He clothes his will in every appearance necessary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1524">As for the emptiness you feel (which perhaps is already better): to those who complained of this sensation of inner emptiness, Sri Aurobindo always said that it is a very good thing; it is the sign that they are going to be filled with something better and truer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1525">I have carefully noted X's predictions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1526">Certainly his political rage is not only understandable but justified. However, when one begins looking at things from the external viewpoint of the manifestation, they are not as simple as that. I cannot speak of all this in detail, but as an example I can tell you that here in Pondicherry, those who are maneuvering (and not without some hope) to oust the Congress are our worst enemies, the enemy of all that is disinterested and spiritual, and if they come to power, they would be capable of anything in their hate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1527">For all these world events, I always leave it to the Divine vision and wisdom, and I say to the Supreme: ‚ÄúLord, may Thy Will be done.‚Äù</p>

<p class="Q">Rameswaram, June 7, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1540">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1541">I thought certain details from my conversations with X might interest you:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1542">1) X spoke to me of the Vedic times when a single ‚Äúemperor‚Äù or sage ruled the entire world with the help of ‚Äúgovernors‚Äù; then these governors gradually became independent kings, and conflicts were born. So I asked him what was going to happen after this next war and whether the world would be better. He replied as follows: ‚Äú<em>Yes, great sages like Sri Aurobindo who are wandering now in their subtle bodies will appear. Some sages may take the physical body of political leaders in the West. It will be the end of ignorant atomic machines and the beginning of a new age with great sages leading the world</em>.‚Äù <em>So</em> it seems that X's vision links up with Sri Aurobindo's prediction for 1967.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1543">He did not give me any further details about this war, except to say that the countries which will suffer the most will be the countries of the North and the East, and he cited Burma, Japan, China and Russia. He said rather categorically that Russia would be swept away and that America would triumph.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1544">2) X gave me certain details about his powers of prediction, but perhaps it would be better not to speak of this in a letter. On that occasion, he told me that he did not want to keep any secrets from me: ‚Äú<em>I want you to know everything. I want you to be chief disciple in my tradition. When the time comes, you will understand</em></p>
<p class="p-num" id="page314">Page 314</p>
<p class="PE"> <em>what I mean. With you I have full connection, not only connection in my mind, but in my blood and body</em>.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1545">On another occasion, he said to me, ‚Äú<em>I am <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS</span> taking care of you</em>.‚Äù And when I asked him why he was taking such trouble for me, he replied, ‚Äú<em>Because I have orders</em>.‚Äù This attention that comes to me from you and him surprises me, for I do not feel that I am good, and upon the least occasion I <em>know</em> that I am seriously prepared to quit everything because something in me is profoundly revolted by this <em>excess of suffering</em>, by a lack of love and flowering, by an excess of solitude. Yesterday evening, it was still fully there, <em>with all my approval</em>, and at such a time no one in the world can hold me back. It is this <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POINT OF SUFFERING</span> that makes me want to turn my back on everything. Not to commit suicide: <em>to turn my back</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1546">X told me the story of my last three existences (rather grim), but I will write you about that in another letter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1547">3) X has not yet begun his work with me nor for you, as he has been unwell until today. One evening, he made a very beautiful reflection concerning you and your mantra, but it is inexpressible in words; it was above all the tone in which he said, ‚Äú<em>Who, who, is there a single person in the world who can repeat like that ‚Äò<span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRIOMPHE √Ä TOI... MAHIMA... MAHIMA</span>‚Äô</em>?‚Äù etc. And three or four times he repeated your mantra with such an expression...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1548">He has not yet done what he plans to do with your mantra in his puja, for he has been unwell and had to interrupt his pujas. But now he is better.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1549">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1550">I have no other details to give you, except that I am not happy. The fact is that these last three years I have been tied down by my penury, otherwise I would be travelling along other roads, far from here ‚Äì with no greater hope in my heart, but with space before me, at least. I am only here to render you service, but I do not know if I shall be able to repress my need for space much longer ‚Äì it has already been going on too long. This is the undisguised truth. But what can I do? ‚Äì I am tied down. If I truly loved, things would be different, but it seems I love no one, not even myself, and the only love of which I am capable, human love, <em>is forbidden</em> to me. So I can do nothing, not on any plane, and I have no hope in anything. Forgive me, I do not wish to pain you, but neither can I pretend any longer to be happy with my lot.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1551">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1552">Even before receiving your second letter in which you say that the mantra is all right, X told me this morning that he had repeated your mantra during his puja and that it was very good, that there is nothing to be changed: <em>‚ÄúThe vibration is good.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1553">Here are a few additional indications regarding the forthcoming events.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1554">As I appeared to be doubting, X told me, <em>‚ÄúThere is no ‚Äòsuspicion‚Äô</em> [doubt], <em>the war will take place in November‚Äù</em> (in fact, it is to occur some time between September and November), and for the rest of the talk, he had a tone of absolute certitude: <em>‚ÄúThe first atom bomb will fall in China. Russia will be crushed. It will be a victory for America. Not more than 2 or 3 atom bombs will be used. It will be very quick.‚Äù</em> And he repeated that the starting-point of the conflict would be situated in India due to the aggression of Pakistan, then of China.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1555">The earthquake he mentioned promises to be a kind of ‚Äúpralaya‚Äù (as X put it), for not only Bombay will be touched. This is what he said: <em>‚ÄúAmerica supports Pakistan, but the gods do not support Pakistan, and Pakistan will be punished by the gods. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HALF</span> of western Pakistan, including Karachi, will go into the sea. The sea will enter into Rajasthan and touch India also...‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1556">X then said that India would side with America against the Communist bloc (in spite of America's support to Pakistan), and furthermore, that the day India sides with America, America will cease supporting Pakistan. In any case, it will be the end of Pakistan.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1557">After I translated your letter to him, X told me that he would give me more details in two or three days.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1558">I should write you what X has revealed about my last three lives, but I have neither the courage nor the desire to again speak of myself.</p>

<p class="PE"> P.S. X asked me questions about my family. I was prompted to speak to him of my mother (seeing her photo, you had said that you knew her very well, if you recall). He immediately said, ‚ÄúYou <em><span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> go and see your mother. You will go in August and quickly come back by plane beginning September!‚Äù</em> Of course, I told him that all this seems like the highest fantasy to me, and that to begin with I had no money and would surely not ask you anything for that. He said, ‚ÄúI <em>shall ask my Mother. She will arrange everything.‚Äù</em></p>

I know that she is sad, that she believes me lost to her and thinks she will die without seeing me again. It would surely be a great joy to her. But other than that, I have no desire to go there, for each time I go to France, I feel like I am entering a prison.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1599">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1600">X told me to tell you what he has seen of my previous lives (but my impression is that he did not tell me everything and that there are elements about which he wants to speak to you personally).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1601">To begin with, I must tell you a dream that I had here in Rameswaram a few days after my arrival. I was being pursued and I fled like an assassin ‚Äì it is a dream I have had hundreds of times for years, but in this dream, there was a new element: while being pursued, I climbed a kind of stairway to try to escape when suddenly, in a flash, I <em>saw</em> a feminine form hurtling into a void.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page322">Page 322</p>
<p class="PE"> I saw only the lower half of her body (with a kind of mauve-colored saree), because she was already falling. And I had the horrible sensation of having pushed this woman into the void, and I fled. I climbed, I climbed these stairs with my pursuers close at my heels, and the image of this falling woman gave me a horrible feeling. When I reached the top of the ‚Äústairs,‚Äù I tried to close a door behind me to stop my pursuers, but there they were, it was too late... and I woke up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1602">The last time I was in Rameswaram, I had two other very poignant dreams, but I could not make out what they meant. In one dream I was strangling someone with my bare hands; it was an abominable feeling. And in the other, I <em>saw</em>, in a kind of nocturnal setting, a hanged man being taken down, with all kinds of people bustling about the corpse with lamps, and suddenly I knew that this hanged man... was <em>me</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1603">I had said <em>nothing</em> to X about these various dreams before he told me the story of my last three existences: three times I committed suicide ‚Äì the first by fire, the second by hanging, and the third by throwing myself into the void. During the first of these last three existences, I was married to a ‚Äúvery good‚Äù woman, but for some reason I abandoned my wife <em>‚Äúand I was wandering here and there in search of something.‚Äù</em> Then I met a sannyasi who wanted to make me his disciple, but I could not make up my mind, I was <em>‚Äúneither this side nor that side,‚Äù</em> whereupon my wife came to me and pleaded with me to take her back. Apparently I rejected her ‚Äì so she threw herself into the fire. Horror-stricken, I followed her, throwing myself into the fire in turn. That was when I created <em>‚Äúa connection‚Äù</em> with certain beings [of the other worlds] and I fell under their power. For two other lives, under the influence of these beings, the same drama was repeated with a few variations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1604">During the second of these last three existences, I was married to the same woman whom I again abandoned under the influence of the same monk, and I again remained between two worlds wandering here and there. Again my wife came to plead with me and again I pushed her away. She hung herself, and I hung myself in turn.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1605">During my last existence, the monk succeeded in making me a sannyasi, and when my wife came to plead with me, I told her, <em>‚ÄúToo late, now I am a sannyasi.‚Äù So</em> she threw herself into the void, and horror-stricken by the sudden revelation of all these dramas</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page323">Page 323</p>
<p class="PE"> and of my wife's goodness (for it seems she was a great soul), I threw myself in turn into the void.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1606">As for this last existence, you already know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1607">X told me, <em>‚ÄúNow it is your last birth. I have received <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ORDER</span> to deliver you.‚Äù</em> So be it. ‚ÄúI <em>shall give you a white cloth,‚Äù</em> he added, <em>‚Äúwith my own hand.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1608">X gave me a new mantra. My body is exhausted from too much nervous tension. I am living in a kind of cellar with four inches of filth on the floor and walls, and two openings, one onto the street of the bazaar, the other onto a dilapidated courtyard with a well. On my right lives a madwoman who screams half the day. There is only my mantra which <em>burns</em> almost constantly in my heart, and who knows what hope that some day the future will be happy and reconciled. There is also Sujata and you.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Thus the bird flew back once more...)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1632">For the West, with all its outward development, a few centuries may be needed before the junction between the two worlds can be made. And yet these two worlds ‚Äì the physical world and the world of Truth ‚Äì are not distant from one another. They are as if superimposed. The world of Truth is there, close by, like a lining of the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1633">Shortly before the 15th of August I had a unique experience that exemplifies all this.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="147" href="#">1</a> For the first time the supramental light entered directly into my body, without passing through the inner beings. It entered through the feet (a red and gold color ‚Äì marvelous, warm, intense), and it climbed up and up. And as it climbed, the fever also climbed because the body was not accustomed to this intensity. As all this light neared the head, I thought I would burst and that the experience would have to be stopped. But then, I very clearly received the indication to make the Calm and Peace descend, to widen all this body-consciousness and all these cells, so that they could contain the supramental light. So I widened, and as the light was ascending, I brought down the vastness and an unshakable peace. And suddenly, there was a second of fainting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1634">I found myself in another world, but not far away (I was not in a total trance). This world was almost as substantial as the physical world. There were rooms ‚Äì Sri Aurobindo's room with the bed he rests on ‚Äì and he was living there, he was there all the time: it was his abode. Even my room was there, with a large mirror like the one I have here, combs, all kinds of things. And the substance of these objects was almost as dense as in the physical world, but they shone with their own light. It was not translucent, not transparent, not radiant, but self-luminous. The various objects and the material of the rooms did not have this same opacity as the physical objects here, they were not dry and hard as in the physical world we know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1635">And Sri Aurobindo was there, with a majesty, a magnificent beauty. He had all his beautiful hair as before. It was all so</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page328">Page 328</p>
<p class="PE"> concrete, so substantial ‚Äì he was even being served some kind of food. I remained there for one hour (I had looked at my watch before and I looked at it afterwards). I spoke to Sri Aurobindo, for I had some important questions to ask him about the way certain things are to be realized. He said nothing. He listened to me quietly and looked at me as if all my words were useless: he understood everything at once. And he answered me with a gesture and two expressions on his face, an unexpected gesture that did not at all correspond to any thought of mine; for example, he picked up three combs that were lying near the mirror (combs similar to those I use here, but larger) and he put them in his hair. He planted one comb in the middle of his head and the two others on each side, as if to gather all his hair over his temples. He was literally <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">COIFFED</span> with these three combs, which gave him a kind of crown. And I immediately understood that by this he meant that he was adopting my conception: ‚ÄúYou see, I embrace your conception of things, and I coif myself with it; it is my will.‚Äù Anyway, I remained there for one hour.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1636">And when I awoke, I didn't have this feeling of returning from afar and of having to re-enter my body, as I usually do. No, it was simply as though I were in this other world, then I took a step backwards and found myself here again. It took me a good half an hour to understand that this world here existed as much as the other and that I was no longer on the other side but here, in the world of falsehood. I had forgotten everything ‚Äì people, things, what I had to do; everything had gone, as if it had no reality at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1637">You see, it's not as if this world of Truth had to be created from nothing: it is fully ready, it is there, like a lining of our own present world. Everything is there, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> is there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1638">I remained in that state for two full days, two days of absolute felicity. And Sri Aurobindo was with me the whole time, the whole time ‚Äì when I walked, he walked with me, when I sat down, he sat next to me. On the day of August 15th, too, he remained there constantly during the darshan. But who was aware of it? A few ‚Äì one or two ‚Äì felt something. But who saw? ‚Äì No one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1639">And I showed all these people to Sri Aurobindo, this whole field of work, and asked him <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WHEN</span> this other world, the real one that is there, so near, would come to take the place of our world of falsehood. <em>Not ready</em>. That was all he replied. <em>Not ready</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1640">Sri Aurobindo gave me two days of this ‚Äì total bliss. But all the same, by the end of the second day I realized that I could not continue to remain there, for the work was not advancing. The work</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page329">Page 329</p>
<p class="PE"> must be done in the body; the realization must be attained here in this physical world, for otherwise it is not complete. So I withdrew from that world and set to work here again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1641">And yet, it would take little, very little, to pass from this world to the other, or for the other to become the real world. A little click would be enough, or rather a little reversal in the inner attitude. How should I put it?... It is imperceptible to the ordinary consciousness; a very little inner shift would be enough, a change in quality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1642">It is similar with this japa: an imperceptible little change, and one can pass from a more or less mechanical, more or less efficient and real japa, to the true japa full of power and light. I even wondered if this difference is what the tantrics call the ‚Äúpower‚Äù of the japa. For example, the other day I was down with a cold. Each time I opened my mouth, there was a spasm in the throat and I coughed and coughed. Then a fever came. So I looked, I saw where it was coming from, and I decided that it had to stop. I got up to do my japa as usual, and I started walking back and forth in my room. I had to apply a certain will. Of course, I could do my japa in trance, I could walk in trance while repeating the japa, because then you feel nothing, none of all the body's drawbacks. But the work has to be done in the body! So I got up and started doing my japa. Then, with each word pronounced ‚Äì the Light, the full Power. A power that heals everything. I began the japa tired, ill, and I came out of it refreshed, rested, cured. So those who tell me they come out of it exhausted, contracted, emptied, it means that they are not doing it in the true way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1643">I understand why certain tantrics advise saying the japa in the heart center. When one applies a certain enthusiasm, when each word is said with a warmth of aspiration, then everything changes. I could feel this difference in myself, in my own japa.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1644">In fact, when I walk back and forth in my room, I don't cut myself off from the rest of the world ‚Äì although it would be so much more convenient!... All kinds of things come to me ‚Äì suggestions, wills, aspirations. But automatically I make a movement of offering: things come to me and just as they are about to touch my head, I turn them upwards and offer them to the Light. They don't enter into me. For example, if someone speaks to me while I am saying my japa, I hear quite well what is being said, I may even answer, but the words remain a little outside, at a certain distance from the head. And yet sometimes, there are things that insist, more defined wills that present themselves to me, so then</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page330">Page 330</p>
<p class="PE"> I have to do a little work, but all that without a pause in the japa. If that happens, there is sometimes a change in the quality of my japa, and instead of being fully the power, fully the light, it is certainly something that produces results, but results more or less sure, more or less long to fructify; it becomes uncertain, as with all things of this physical world. Yet the difference between the two japas is imperceptible; it's not a difference between saying the japa in a more or less mechanical way and saying it consciously, because even while I work I remain fully conscious of the japa ‚Äì I continue to repeat it putting the full meaning into each syllable. But nevertheless, there is a difference. One is the all-powerful japa; the other, an almost ordinary japa... There is a difference in the inner attitude. Perhaps for the japa to become true, a kind of joy, an elation, a warmth of enthusiasm has to be added ‚Äì but especially joy. Then everything changes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1645">Well, it is the same thing, the same imperceptible difference, when it comes to entering the world of Truth. On one side there is the falsehood, and on the other, close by, like the lining of this one, the true life. Only a little difference in the inner quality, a little reversal, is enough to pass to the other side, into the Truth and Light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1646">Perhaps simply to add joy would suffice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1647">I will have to look at this in my body since that is where it is happening, where things are being prepared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1648"><em>This other world you speak of, this world of Truth, is it the supramental world?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1649">My feeling is that this life which Sri Aurobindo is living right now is not the full satisfaction of the supramental life for him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1650">In this other world, there was infinity, majesty, perfect calm, eternity ‚Äì all was there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1651">Perhaps it was joy that was missing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1652">Of course, Sri Aurobindo himself had joy. But I had the impression that it was not total and that this is why I had to continue the work. I felt that it could only be total when things here have changed.</p>

<p class="Q">Rameswaram, October 15, 1959</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1653">Sweet Mother,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1654">Here are two or three things that might interest you:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1655">1) X spoke to me again of the war without my asking anything. He repeated, <em>‚ÄúThere will be war,‚Äù</em> and he again spoke of an attack on India by China...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1656">2) X spoke to me of the Ashram's financial difficulties and said, <em>‚ÄúI shall tell you the secret why there are such difficulties.‚Äù I</em> think he is going to speak to me today or tomorrow. In any case, he told me that he was working (‚ÄúI <em>am preparing‚Äù...)</em> to change these conditions, and he asked me if there had been any improvement as yet. I replied that I did not believe the situation had changed very much. He spoke as well of certain people in the Ashram, but I will tell you about this in person. He had a rather amusing way of speaking about people, <em>‚Äúpeople who pretend to worship the Mother but who keep their mind as a dustbin!‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1657">.........</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1658">7) X wants to send me back to Pondicherry this Sunday (Sunday the 18th, arriving Monday the 19th morning). He says it is useless for me now to remain here any longer since his house is not ready and he can do nothing. But, he said, ‚ÄúI will have you come to my house for 3 months <em>and I shall give you a training by which you can know Past, Present and Future, and have the same qualifications as me‚Äù!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1659">8) He gave me certain methods to follow, about which I shall speak to you in person.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1660">Sweet Mother, I have such a yearning for everything in my consciousness to harmonize and for the tantric discipline, the japa, etc., not to separate me from you. I want to be your child, open to you, without any contradictions. I would like so much to find your <em>almost physical</em> Presence within me again, as before. May all be clear, pure, one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1661">I would wish to be like Sujata, completely transparent, your</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page332">Page 332</p>
<p class="PE"> child with her at your feet. Mother, help me. I need you. Sujata is <em>healing</em> something that was very painful in me, as though it were flayed or wounded, and which threw me into revolt. With this calming influence, I would like to begin a new life of self-giving. This change of residence is for me like the symbol of another change. Oh, Mother! may the painful road be over, and may all be achieved in the joy of your Will.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1662">There is a difference between immortality and the deathless state. Sri Aurobindo has described it very well in <em>Savitri</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1663">The deathless state is what can be envisaged for the human physical body in the future: it is constant rebirth. Instead of again tumbling backwards and falling apart due to a lack of plasticity and an incapacity to adapt to the universal movement, the body is undone ‚Äúfuturewards,‚Äù as it were.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1664">There is one element that remains fixed: for each type of atom, the inner organization of the elements is different, which is what creates the difference in their substance. So perhaps similarly, each individual has a different, particular way of organizing the cells of his body, and it is this particular way that persists through all the outer changes. All the rest is undone and redone, but undone in a forward thrust towards the new instead of collapsing backwards into death, and redone in a constant aspiration to follow the progressive movement of the divine Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1665">But for that, the body ‚Äì the body-consciousness ‚Äì must first learn to widen itself. It is indispensable, for otherwise all the cells become a kind of boiling porridge under the pressure of the supramental light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1666">What usually happens is that when the body reaches its maximum intensity of aspiration or of ecstasy of Love, it is unable to contain it. It becomes flat, motionless. It falls back. Things settle down ‚Äì you are enriched with a new vibration, but then everything</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page333">Page 333</p>
<p class="PE"> resumes its course. So you must widen yourself in order to learn to bear unflinchingly the intensities of the supramental force, to go forward always, always with the ascending movement of the divine Truth, without falling backwards into the decrepitude of the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1667">That is what Sri Aurobindo means when he speaks of an <em>intolerable ecstasy</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="148" href="#">1</a>; it is not an intolerable ecstasy: it is an unflinching ecstasy.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1717"><em> All these repetitions of the mantra, these hours of japa I have to do every day, seem to have increased the difficulties, as if they were raising up or aggravating all the resistances.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1718">To the most stubborn goes the victory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1719">When I started my japa one year ago, I had to struggle with every possible difficulty, every contradiction, prejudice and opposition that fills the air. And even when this poor body began walking back and forth for japa, it used to knock against things, it would start breathing all wrong, coughing; it was attacked from all sides until the day I caught the Enemy and said, ‚ÄúListen carefully. You can do whatever you want, but I'm going right to the end and nothing will stop me, even if I have to repeat this mantra ten crore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="150" href="#">1</a> times.‚Äù The result was really miraculous, like a cloud of bats flying up into the light all at once. From that moment on, things started going better.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1720">You have no idea what an irresistible effect a well-determined will can have.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1721">Some difficulties remained, of course, but they stemmed more from what had to change within.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1722">Actually, difficulties come from very small things; they may seem quite commonplace, totally uninteresting, but they block the way. They come for no earthly reason ‚Äì some detail, a word that comes rubbing against a sensitive spot, an illness in someone close to me, anything at all, and suddenly something in me contracts. Then all the work has to be started afresh as though nothing had been done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1723">Of all forms of ego, you might think that the physical ego is the most difficult to conquer (or rather, the body ego, because the work was already done long ago on the physical ego). It might be thought that the form of the body is a point of concentration, and that without this concentration or hardness, physical life would not be possible. But that's not true. The body is really a wonderful instrument; it's capable of widening and of becoming vast in such a way that everything, everything ‚Äì the slightest gesture, the least little task ‚Äì is done in a wonderful harmony and with a</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page357">Page 357</p>
<p class="PE"> remarkable plasticity. Then all of a sudden, for something quite stupid, a draft, a mere nothing, it forgets ‚Äì it shrinks back into itself, it gets afraid of disappearing, afraid of not being. And everything has to be started again from scratch. So in the yoga of matter you start realizing how much endurance is needed. I calculated it would take 200 years to say ten crore of my japa. Well, I'm ready to struggle 200 years if necessary, but the work will be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1724">Sri Aurobindo had made it clear to me when I was still in France that this yoga in matter is the most difficult of all. For the other yogas, the paths have been well laid, you know where to tread, how to proceed, what to do in such-and-such a case. But for the yoga of matter, nothing has ever been done, never, so at each moment everything has to be invented.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1725">Of course, things are now going better, especially since Sri Aurobindo became established in the subtle physical, an almost material subtle physical.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="151" href="#">2</a> But there are still plenty of question marks... The body understands once, and then it forgets. The Enemy's opposition is nothing, for I can see clearly that it comes from outside and that it's hostile, so I do what's necessary. But where the difficulty lies is in all the small things of daily material life ‚Äì suddenly the body no longer understands, it forgets.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1726">Yet it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAPPY</span>. It loves doing the work, it lives only for that ‚Äì to change, to transform itself is its reason for being. And it's such a docile instrument, so full of good will! Once it even started wailing like a baby: ‚ÄúO Lord, give me the time, the time to be transformed...‚Äù It has such a simple fervor for the work, but it needs time ‚Äì time, that's it. It wants to live only to conquer, to win the Lord's Victory.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="152" href="#">3</a></p>

That's why we must date all these <em>Questions and Answers</em>, at least all which come before the [Supramental] Manifestation of February 1956, so that there will be a clear cut between those before and those after.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1729">Only a few days ago, on the morning of the 29th, I had one of those experiences that mark one's life. It happened upstairs in my room. I was doing my japa, walking up and down with my eyes wide open, when suddenly Krishna came ‚Äì a gold Krishna, all golden, in a golden light that filled the whole room. I was walking, but I could not even see the windows or the rug any longer, for this golden light was everywhere with Krishna at its center. And it must have lasted at least fifteen minutes. He was dressed in those same clothes in which he is normally portrayed when he dances. He was all light, all dancing: ‚ÄúYou see, I will be there this evening during the Darshan.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="153" href="#">1</a>‚Äù And suddenly, the chair I use for darshan came into the room! Krishna climbed up onto it, and his eyes twinkled mischievously, as if to say, ‚ÄúI will be there, you see, and there'll be no room for you.‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page359">Page 359</p>
<p class="PE"> When I came down that evening for distribution,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="154" href="#">2</a> at first I was annoyed. I had said that I didn't want anybody in the hall, precisely because I wanted to establish an atmosphere of concentration, the immobility of the Spirit ‚Äì but there were at least thirty people in there, those who had decorated the hall, thirty of them stirring, stirring about, a mass of little vibrations. And before I could even say ‚Äúscat‚Äù ‚Äì I had hardly taken my seat ‚Äì someone put the tray of medals on my lap and they started filing past.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1730">But what is surprising is that in a flash, no one was there any longer. No one, you understand ‚Äì I was gone. Perhaps I was everywhere (but in fact I am always everywhere, I am always conscious of being everywhere at the same time), though normally there is the sense of the body, a physical center, but that evening there was no more center! Nothing, no one, not even the sense that there was no one ‚Äì nothing. I was gone. There was indeed something handing out the medals which felt the joy of giving the medal, the joy of receiving it, the joy of mutually looking at each other. It was simply the joy of the action taking place, the joy of looking, this joy everywhere, but me? ‚Äì Nothing, no one, gone. Only later, afterwards, did I see what had happened, for everything had disappeared, even the higher mind that understands and organizes things (by ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù I mean contain, which ‚Äúcontains‚Äù things). That also was gone. And this lasted the entire distribution. Only when that [the body] had gone back upstairs to the room did the consciousness of what is me return.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1731">There is a line by Sri Aurobindo in <em>Savitri</em> which expresses this very well: to annul oneself so that only the Supreme Lord may be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1732">And there are many, many experiences like this. It is only a small, a very small beginning. This one in particular came to mark the new stage: four years have elapsed, and now four years to come. Because everything has focused on this body to prepare it, everything has concentrated on it ‚Äì Nature, the Master of the Yoga, the Supreme, everything... So only when it's over, not before, will it really be interesting to speak of all this. But maybe it will never be over, after all. It's a small beginning, very small.</p>

<p class="PE"> It happened last night. For approximately three hours, the physical ego disintegrated for the first time in such a total way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1812">Nothing remained but the Force, nothing remained but <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="159" href="#">1</a> and not only in the consciousness but in the physical sensation ‚Äì the divine Satchidananda spreading in a constant flood throughout the universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1813">These experiences are always absolute, as long as they last; then, through certain signs that I know (I am accustomed to it), I notice that the body consciousness begins closing up again. Or rather, ‚Äúsomething‚Äù ‚Äì evidently a Supreme Wisdom ‚Äì decides it's sufficient for this time and that the body has had enough. It ought not to break, which is why certain precautions are taken. So this comes in several little stages that I know quite well. The final one is always a bit unpleasant because my body gets into rather peculiar positions as a result of the work. As it's only a sort of machine, towards the end I have some difficulty straightening my knees, for example, or opening my fingers ‚Äì I think they even make a noise, like something forced into one position whose life has become purely spontaneous and mechanical. There are plenty of people like that, plenty, who enter into trance and then can no longer get out by themselves; they get themselves into a certain position and someone has to free them. This has never happened to me; I have always managed to extricate myself. But yesterday evening, the experience lasted a very long time. There was even a little cracking at the end, as when people have rheumatism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1814">And during all this time, approximately three hours, the consciousness was completely, completely different. It was here, however; it was not outside the earth, it was on earth, but it was completely different ‚Äì even the body consciousness was different. And what remained was very mechanical; it was a body, but it could just as well have been anything. All this power of consciousness that for more than seventy years I've gradually pushed into each of the body's cells so that each cell could become conscious (and it goes on constantly, constantly), all this seemed to have withdrawn ‚Äì there only remained one almost lifeless thing.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page372">Page 372</p>
<p class="PE"> However, I could raise myself up from my bed and even drink a glass of water, but it was all so... bizarre. And when I went back to bed, it took nearly forty-five minutes for the body to regain its normal state. Only after I had entered into another type of <em>samadhi</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="160" href="#">2</a> and again come out of it did my consciousness fully return. It is the first time I have had an experience of this kind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1815">During those three hours, there was nothing but the Supreme manifesting through the eternal Mother.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1816">But there was no consciousness of being Mother, neither eternal nor whatever: it was a continuous and all-powerful flood, and so extraordinarily varied, of the Lord manifesting Himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1817">It was as vast as the universe, a continuous movement ‚Äì the movement of manifestation of something which was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span> at once, a single whole. There was no division. And such a variety of colors, vibrations, powers ‚Äì extraordinary! It was one single thing, and everything was within it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1818">The three Supreme Principles were very clearly there: Existence, Consciousness (an active, realizing consciousness) and Ananda. A universal vastness that kept going on and on and on...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1819">It moves and it doesn't move. How can you explain that? It was in motion, a constant, unceasing motion, and yet there was no shifting of place. I had the perception, or rather there was the perception, of something which <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> forever, which never repeated itself, neither began nor ended, which didn't shift places yet was always in motion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1820">Words cannot express it. No translation, none, not even the most subtle mental translation can express this. It was... Even now the memory I have of it is inexpressible. You have to be in it to feel it, otherwise...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1821">However, to the consciousness it was very, very clear. It was neither mysterious nor incomprehensible, it was absolutely obvious ‚Äì though untranslatable to our mental consciousness. For they were contradictory, yet they existed simultaneously, indistinguishable: they were not stacked one upon another ‚Äì it was all simultaneous. How can you explain that?! It's too difficult. It must be experienced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1822">You see, when something goes beyond thought, a sort of conception of it, or superconception rather, remains behind. But in this case, in my experience, there was no question of thought ‚Äì it was a question of physical sensation. It was not beyond thought,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page373">Page 373</p>
<p class="PE"> it was beyond sensation. I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVING</span> this thing. And there was no more ‚ÄúI‚Äù. There was nothing but this thing, and yet there was a sensation. I can't explain it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1823">When I went back to bed, the transitional period lasted 45 minutes. During this time, I tried to locate the role of the individual consciousness on earth. In a flash, I understood its purpose. For you see, as long as the experience lasted, I did not feel any necessity at all of an individuality for this supreme flood to manifest. Then I understood, precisely, that the individuality served to put into contact, in this flood, all that reached out towards what is called ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚Äì this individualized representation of the Divine ‚Äì in order to receive help and support from it, and to be put into contact. I did not say ‚Äúput into contact <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WITH</span> this flood‚Äù but ‚Äúput into contact <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> this flood,‚Äù for it was not happening outside ‚Äì nothing was outside this flood, nothing exists outside it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1824">And what was really very lovely was the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ACCURACY</span> and the power which directed the forces. I watched this for three quarters of an hour: for each thing that presented itself (it could have been someone thinking, something taking place, anything at all), a special little concentration of this flood went exactly onto that point, like a special insistence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1825">And all this was absolutely egoless, without any personal reaction, nothing; there was nothing but the consciousness of the Supreme Action. It was the only thing existing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1826">And of course, the whole ordinary and higher mind (as well as the physical mind, it goes without saying, for that must be abolished before going into trance), everything here in the head, above the head, around the head ‚Äì absolutely immobile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1827">After all that, towards the end of the night, at two in the morning, only a kind of faint suggestion was left: How can this state ‚Äì which I knew in trance, in samadhi, and which necessitates lying down ‚Äì become constant in a physical body which moves about? There is something to discover there. And what form will it take? For in my consciousness, you see, it is constantly like that, this universal flood, but the problem is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN THE BODY</span>: it's the problem of the Force in its most material form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1828">And during the time my experience lasted, I had no feeling of anything exceptional, but rather simply the fact that after all its preparation, the body consciousness was ready for a total identification with That ‚Äì in my consciousness it's always the same, a perpetual, constant and eternal state in that it never leaves me. It's like that, and it never varies. What diminishes the immensity</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page374">Page 374</p>
<p class="PE"> of the Vibration are the limitations of the material consciousness which can color it and even sometimes change it by giving it a personal appearance. Thus, when I see someone and speak to him, for example, when my eyes concentrate on the person, I have almost the sensation of this flood flowing from me towards the person or of it passing through me to go onto the person. There is an awareness of the eyes, the body. And it is this which limits or even changes a little the immensity of the thing... But already this feeling has almost disappeared; this immensity seems to be acting almost constantly. There are moments when I am less interiorized, when I am more on the surface, and it feels like it's passing through a body ‚Äì moments when the body consciousness comes back a little. And this is what diminishes the thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1829">This experience last night also enabled me to understand what X had felt during one of our meditations. He had explained his experience by way of saying that I was this mystic tree whose roots plunge into the Supreme and whose branches spread forth over the world,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="161" href="#">3</a> and he said that one of these branches had entered into him ‚Äì and it had been a unique experience. He had said, ‚Äúthis is the Mother.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1830">And now I understand that what he had seen and translated by this Vedic image was that kind of perpetual flood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1831">And you see, this experience he had, this contact between him and me, is just a point, a drop, it's nothing; it's merely something the consciousness puts into words, but the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THING</span> itself is universal. Last night it was universal; there was no room, no bed, no door ‚Äì and it was concrete, concrete, so concrete, with such a splendor! There was all the Joy ‚Äì this perpetual downpour in a limitless splendor.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1832">I was reluctant to speak (because of this problem that remains hanging: to make it permanent, even in the active consciousness), and I said to myself that if I speak, it will create difficulties for me in finding the solution... But it's all right. I shall simply have to make a still greater effort, because something always evaporates when you speak.</p>

<p class="PE"> K left his body. The operation had been extraordinarily, almost miraculously successful ‚Äì one of those dreadful operations where they extract part of your body. He was quite all right for four days afterwards, then everything went wrong.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1833">During the operation and just afterwards, I had simply put the Force on him, as I always do in such cases, so that everything would turn out for the best. Then a few days ago, during my japa, a kind of order came ‚Äì a very clear order ‚Äì to concentrate on him so that he would be conscious of his soul and able to leave under the best conditions. And I saw that the concentration worked wonderfully: it seems that during his last days he was ceaselessly repeating <em>Ma-Ma-Ma</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="162" href="#">1</a> ‚Äì even while he was in a semi-coma.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1834">And the concentration grew stronger and stronger. The day before yesterday it became very, very powerful, and yesterday morning, around half past noon, it pulled me inward; he came to me in a kind of sleep, a conscious sleep, and I even said almost aloud, ‚ÄúOh, K!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1835">It lasted fifteen minutes; I was completely within, inside, as if to receive him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1836">But there is something interesting: when I went down at 2 p.m., I found the family had come to inform me that they had been notified by telephone that he had died at 11:45 a.m. Myself, I saw him come at 12:30.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1837">So you see, the outer signs... It's not the first time I've noticed this ‚Äì the doctors observe all the outer signs, then they declare you dead, but you're still in your body!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1838">In other words, he was still in his body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1839">So it's probably during this period that people are ‚Äúresuscitated,‚Äù as they say. It must be during this period, for they have not left their bodies, they are not really dead, though the heart may give every appearance of having stopped. So K left his body at around half past noon, and officially it was at 11:45. Forty-five minutes later, in other words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1840">And it takes place very gently, very gently (when it's done right), very gently, very gently, smoothly, without any shock.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1841">So this morning they're burning him.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page376">Page 376</p>
<p class="PE"> When they're in too much of a hurry to burn them, sometimes they burn them alive!... They should wait.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1842">For there's a consciousness of the form, a life of the form. There's a consciousness, a consciousness in the form assumed by the cells. That takes <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEVEN DAYS</span> to come out. So sometimes the body makes abrupt movements when burned ‚Äì people say it's mechanical. It's not mechanical, I know it's not.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1843">I know it. I know that this consciousness of the form exists since I have actually gone out of it. Once, long back, I was in a so-called cataleptic state, and after awhile, while still in this state, the body began living again<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="163" href="#">2</a>; that is, it was capable of speaking and even moving (it was Th√©on who gave me this training). The body managed to get up and move. And yet, everything had gone out of it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1844">Once everything had gone out, it naturally became cold, but the body consciousness manages to draw a little energy from the air, from this or that... And I spoke in that state. I spoke ‚Äì I spoke very well, and besides, I recounted all I was seeing elsewhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1845">So I don't like this habit of burning people very much.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1846">I think they do it here (apart from entirely sanitary considerations in the case of people who have died from nasty diseases), here in India, mainly because they are very afraid of all these little entities that come from desires, impulses ‚Äì things which are dispersed in the air and which make ‚Äúghosts‚Äù and all kinds of things. All desires, all attachments, all those things are like pieces that break off (each one goes its own way, you see), then these pieces gain strength in the surrounding atmosphere, and when they can fasten on to someone, they vampirize him. Then they keep on trying to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1847">The world, the terrestrial atmosphere, is full of filth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1848">And people here are much more sensitive than in Europe because they are much more interiorized, so they are conscious of all these little entities, and naturally they're afraid. And the more afraid they are, the more they're vampirized!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1849">I think that many of these entities are dispersed by fire ‚Äì that creates havoc.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page377">Page 377</p>
<p class="PE"> I know one person, a boy who died here, who was burned before he had left! He had a weak heart, and not enough care was taken ‚Äì that is, they probably should not have operated on him. He was our engineer. He died in the hospital. Not a serious operation, an appendicitis, but his heart could not take up its natural movement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1850">But as he was accustomed to going out of his body, he didn't know! He even used to make experiments ‚Äì he would go out, circle around in his room, see his body from outside, observe the difference between the subtle physical and the material physical, etc. So he didn't know. And it's only when they burned his body...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1851">I tried to delay the moment, but he was in the hospital, so it was difficult. I was in my room when they burned his body, and then suddenly I saw him arrive ‚Äì sobbing ‚Äì saying, ‚ÄúBut... But I'm dead. I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DIDN'T WANT</span> to die! Why am I dead, I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DIDN'T WANT</span> to die!‚Äù It was dreadful. So I kept him and held him against me to quiet him down.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1852">He remained there for years.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1853">And whenever we used to have meetings to decide on the construction of something or on repairs to be made, for example, I always felt him there and he influenced those who were present.</p>

<p class="Ps"> <em>(The disciple complains of his bad nights)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1868">If you wake up tired in the morning, it is due to <em>tamas</em>, nothing else ‚Äì a dreadful mass of tamas. I became aware of this when I started doing the yoga of the body. And it's inevitable as long as the body is not transformed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1869">Myself, I go to bed very early, at eight o'clock. It's still quite noisy everywhere, but I don't mind; at least I'm sure of no longer being disturbed. First you must stretch out flat and relax all your muscles, all your nerves ‚Äì you can learn this easily ‚Äì become like a ‚Äúdishrag‚Äù on the bed, as I call it; there should be nothing left. And if you can also do that with the mind, you get rid of a lot of idiotic dreams that make you more tired when you wake up than when you went to bed; they are the result of the cellular activity of the brain going on uncontrollably, which is very tiring. Therefore, relax fully, bring everything to a complete, tensionless calm in which everything has stopped. But this is only the beginning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1870">Once I'm relaxed, I have developed the habit of repeating my mantra. But it's very strange with these mantras ‚Äì I don't know how it is for others; I'm speaking of my own mantra, the one I myself found ‚Äì it came spontaneously. Depending on the occasion, the time, depending on what I might call the purpose for repeating it, it has quite different results. For example, I use it to establish the contact while walking back and forth in my room ‚Äì my mantra is a mantra of evocation; I evoke the Supreme and establish the contact with the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1871">This is the main reason for my japa. There's a power in the sound itself, and by forcing the body to repeat the sound, you force it to receive the vibration at the same time. But I've noticed that if something in the body's working gets disturbed (a pain or disorder, the onset of some illness) and I repeat my mantra in a certain way ‚Äì still the same words, the same mantra, but said with a certain purpose and above all in a movement of <em>surrender</em>, surrender of the pain, the disorder, and a call, like an opening ‚Äì it has a marvelous effect. The mantra acts in just the right way, in this way and in no other. And after a while everything is put back in order. And simultaneously, of course, the precise knowledge of what lies behind the disorder and what I must do to set it right</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page380">Page 380</p>
<p class="PE"> comes to me. But quite apart from this, the mantra acts directly upon the pain itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1872">I also use my mantra to go into trance. After relaxing on the bed and making as total a self-offering as possible of everything, from top to bottom, and after removing as fully as possible all resistance of the ego, I start repeating the mantra.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="164" href="#">1</a> After repeating it two or three times, I am in trance (at the beginning it took longer). And from this trance I pass into sleep; the trance lasts as long as necessary and, quite naturally, spontaneously, I pass into sleep. And when I come back, I remember everything. The sleep was like a continuation of the trance. And essentially, the only reason for sleep is to allow the body to assimilate the results of the trance, then to allow these results to be accepted throughout and to let the body do its natural night's work of eliminating toxins. My periods of sleep practically don't exist; sometimes they are as short as half an hour or 15 minutes. But in the beginning, I had long periods of sleep, one or even two hours in succession. And when I woke up, I did not feel this residue of heaviness which comes from sleep ‚Äì the effects of the trance continued.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1873">It is even good for people who've never been in trance to repeat a mantra (or a word, a prayer) before going to sleep. But the words must have a life of their own ‚Äì by this I don't mean an intellectual meaning, nothing of the kind, but rather a vibration. And this has an extraordinary effect on the body; it starts vibrating, vibrating, vibrating... and so calm, you let yourself go, like falling off to sleep. And the body vibrates more and more, more and more, more and more, and you drift off.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1874">Such is the cure for tamas.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1875">It's tamas that gives you a bad sleep. There are two kinds of bad sleep ‚Äì that which makes you heavy and leaden, as if the result of all your effort the day before were wasted; and that which exhausts you, as if you had spent the whole time fighting. And I've observed that if you cut your sleep up into sections (it becomes a habit), the nights get better. In other words, you must be able to come back to your normal consciousness and your normal aspiration at certain intervals, come back to the call of your consciousness... But you must not use an alarm clock. When in trance, it's not good to be jolted.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page381">Page 381</p>
<p class="PE"> Just as you are drifting off, you can make a formation and say, ‚ÄúI shall wake up at such-and-such time‚Äù (children do it very easily).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1876">You should count on at least three hours for the first part of your sleep; for the last part, one hour is enough. But the first should be a minimum of three hours. In fact, it is best to remain in bed for at least seven hours; with six, you don't have the time to do much (of course, I'm speaking from the standpoint of sadhana, to make the nights useful).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1877">But for years together I only slept 2 ¬Ω hours a night in all. I mean that my night consisted of 2 
¬Ω hours. And I went straight to Sat-Chit-Ananda and then came back: 2 ¬Ω hours were spent like that. But the body was tired. That lasted more than five or six years while Sri Aurobindo was still in his body. And during the day, I was all the time going into trance for the least thing (it was trance, not sleep ‚Äì I was conscious). But I clearly saw that the body was affected, for it had no time to burn its toxins.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="165" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1878">...There would be many interesting things to tell about sleep, because it's one of the things I've studied the most ‚Äì to speak of how I became conscious of my nights, for instance. (I learned this with Th√©on, and now that I know all these things of India, I realize that he knew a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> deal.) But it bothers me a lot to say ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚Äì I this, I that. I'd rather speak of these things in the form of a treatise or an essay on sleep, for example. Sri Aurobindo always spoke of his experiences but rarely did he say ‚ÄúI‚Äù ‚Äì it always sounds like boasting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1879">Sri Aurobindo said that the true or yogic reason for sleep is to put the consciousness back into contact with Sat-Chit-Ananda (I used to do this without knowing it). For some people the contact is established immediately, while for others it takes eight, nine, ten hours to do it. But really, normally you should not wake up till the contact has been established, and that's why it's very bad to wake up in an artificial way (with an alarm clock, for example), because then the night is wasted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1880">As for me, my night is now organized. I go to bed at 8 o'clock and get up at 4, which makes for a very long night, and it's sliced into three parts. And I get up punctually at 4 in the morning. But I'm always awake ten or fifteen minutes beforehand, and I review all that has happened during the night, the dreams, the various activities, etc., so that when I get up, I am fully active.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page382">Page 382</p>
<p class="PE"> To make use of your nights is an excellent thing, for it has a double effect: a negative effect, in that it keeps you from falling backwards, from losing what you've gained (that is really painful); and a positive effect, in that you progress, you continue progressing. You make use of your nights, so there's no more residue of fatigue.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1881">There are two things to avoid: falling into a stupor of unconsciousness, with all those things coming up from the subconscious and the unconscious that invade and penetrate you; and a vital and mental hyperactivity in which you pass your time literally fighting ‚Äì terrible battles. People come out of that black and blue, as if they had been beaten ‚Äì and they have been, it is not ‚Äúas if‚Äù! And I see only one way out ‚Äì to change the nature of sleep.</p>

And throughout the whole experience, it remained like that ‚Äì a very tiny part of myself. Everything else was... I can't say deconcentrated, but an entirely general, overall activity, as it normally is every night. And I saw the Ashram quite clearly ‚Äì it was something special, made for special reasons, but whereas I seemed to have an immense body, that was very small, very small. It went on for an hour.

It began just here <span class="note_1"><em>(the navel)</em></span> and went that way <span class="note_1"><em>(downwards)</em></span>, and it was encircled, to show that it was a special formation ‚Äì encircled in the inconscience of the terrestrial creation. And I was everything else, with the usual vibrations of power and light. And then one current and another current and another were passing into it, into this formation, and they kept going in and in and in, accumulating. They kept going in, and yet they did not come out, they did not leave. It was not an undulatory movement, but rather a pulsating movement ‚Äì it had no beginning, it didn't go out, and yet it kept moving. It's very difficult to describe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1954">The formation represented by the Ashram was located approximately here, at the height of the navel in relation to what I was ‚Äì but although the body was not delimited, it had certain attributes or undefined forms, each one of which was situated in relation to the other as though each represented one part of the body; each was symbolic of either an activity or a part of the world or a mode of manifestation. So the formation started from about here, near the navel, and went down towards the appendix... Here, I'll draw you a sketch:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1955" style="text-align: center"><img alt="Agenda Image" class="cover-image" src="static/HTML/Agenda_1_imges/1-july-12-1960.jpg"/></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1956">It's form was elongated, slanting downwards (it always has this form). At the top it looked like a head, then the lines disappeared down below. It had no openings. And then, it was surrounded by various dark sheaths, a very dark purple which is the color of protection. A sparkling light was entering into it ‚Äì it kept entering, but without making any holes. It passed right through everything, through the purple ‚Äì through everything. It passed through and entered inside, where there were sparklings of every color, like a cascade. There are always these cascades of force ‚Äì similar to a</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page391">Page 391</p>
<p class="PE"> cascading stream whose waters neither flow on nor disappear, but accumulate: an accumulation of energies, a condensation. And they accumulate without taking up any more space through a kind of compression. And inside, it's moving, vibrating, vibrating, vibrating, it keeps coming and coming ‚Äì you don't know where it comes from, but it keeps coming and accumulating.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1957">It was a force with a sparkling white light at its center, the light which is the force of the Divine Mother, and as soon as it was well packed and concentrated inside, or condensed, it took on all the colors ‚Äì vibrations of every color... Like a materialization ‚Äì these colors were like a materialization of the Divine Force when it enters matter. (Just as matter is a condensation of energy, well, this seemed to be a condensation of Divine Force. That's really the impression it gave.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1958">It reminded me of tantric things. I have seen tantric formations and how forces are systematically separated by them ‚Äì each vibration, each color. It's very interesting. They are all one, and yet each is distinct. That is, they are separated in order to be distinguished and for each one to be used individually. Each one represents a particular action for obtaining something in particular. This is the special knowledge the tantrics have, I believe. Or it's the reflection of their knowledge. And my impression is that when they do their pujas or say their mantras, what they are trying to do is recombine all that into the white light. I'm not sure. I know they use each one separately for a separate purpose, but when they speak of their puja ‚Äúsucceeding,‚Äù it may mean that they have been able to recombine the light. But I say this very guardedly. For I would have to see X do his puja one day to really know ‚Äì from afar I'm not so sure. It's merely an impression.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1959">This is what I am constantly seeing now, but along with this Divine Force or this Divine Consciousness that Sri Aurobindo speaks of when he says, ‚ÄúMother's Force is with you.‚Äù When it comes, it is sparkling white, perfectly white and perfectly luminous. And as it accumulates inside, it makes living vibrations of every color. And it goes on and on and on. Sometimes it lasts half an hour, three-quarters of an hour, an hour ‚Äì nothing goes out. And it keeps constantly entering. And it piles up. It's as if it is all being accumulated or compressed together.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1960">So, the observing mind, the intelligence that watches, looked at all this ‚Äì ‚ÄúAh, that's what it's like‚Äù (an intelligence that watches without interfering in the least). It's like a spectator talking to himself.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1981">Something interesting happened last night exactly between ten and eleven. I was in some kind of vehicle. I didn't see the vehicle but I was in it. Someone in front of me was driving, though I could only see his back; I didn't bother about who it was ‚Äì he was simply the one meant to do it.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page395">Page 395</p>
<p class="PE"> It was as if the doors of destruction had been flung open. Floods ‚Äì floods as vast as an ocean ‚Äì were rushing down onto... something... the earth? A formidable current pouring down at an insane speed, with an unstoppable power. It was brackish water ‚Äì not transparent, but brackish. And it was imperative to reach a certain spot <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BEFORE</span> the water. Had the water reached there ahead of me, nothing could have been done. Whereas if I got there first (I say ‚ÄúI‚Äù, but it was not I with this body), if I got to the other side before the water, I would be completely safe; and from this safe position, I would be able, I would have a chance to help those left behind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1982">And this vehicle was going faster than the flood (I saw and felt it by its motion) ‚Äì a formidable flood, but the vehicle was going still faster. It was so wonderful. In places there were some especially difficult and dangerous spots, but I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS</span> got there before the water, just before the water barred the way. And we kept going and going and going. Then, with a final effort (there was no effort, really, it was willed), with a final push, we made it to the other side ‚Äì and the water came rushing just behind! It rushed down at a fantastic speed. We had made it. Then, just on the other side, it changed color. It was... it changed in color to a predominant blue, this powerful blue which is the force, the organizing force in the most material world. So there we were, and the vehicle stopped. And then, after having been looking straight ahead the whole time we were speeding along, I turned around and said, ‚ÄúAh, now I can start helping those who are behind.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1983">Here, I'll draw you a little sketch:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1984" style="text-align: center"><img alt="Agenda Image" class="cover-image" src="static/HTML/Agenda_1_imges/1-july-23-1960.jpg"/></p>

<p class="PE"> The water was flowing off towards the right. From time to time there were these fissured dips or depressions along the vehicle's path where the water rushed through, and in fact it must have rushed through each one just as soon as I had sped past. It was most dangerous, for if you had reached there a second too late, the water would already have flooded in and you would no longer have been able to get across; it was such that with even only a few drops, you would no longer get across. Not that they were very wide, but... And the water was pouring in (‚Äúpouring in‚Äù... our words are very small), it was pouring in, and I could see it ahead, but then the vehicle would arrive at full speed and instead of stopping, in a wild roller coaster-like movement it would plunge through, vroom! ‚Äì just in time, exactly like a roller coaster. I always arrived just in time to get through. And then again the same thing, broken here and there (in this way there were many fissures, though I've only drawn two; there were quite a few, five or six at least), and again we would dart across, then race on until we would reach the spot where I have drawn the water turning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1985">Right at the end, there was a place where the water had to turn to run down ‚Äì this was the Great Passage. If you got caught in that, it was all over. You had to reach this spot and cross over before the water came. It was the only place you could get across. Then a last plunge, and like an arrow shot from a bow, full speed ahead, I crossed over and there I was.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1986">And once on the other side, without even a rise in groundlevel (I don't know why), it was immediately safe. And the current went on and on, waves upon waves, on and on, as far as the eye could see, but it was channelized¬†¬†¬†¬† here at the Great Turning; and as soon as it went past this point, the inundation was total, it spread out over something... over the earth. And the current turned ‚Äì it turned ‚Äì but I was already on the other side. And down below, everything was finished, the water rushed down everywhere. Only, as soon as I was on the other side, it could not touch me ‚Äì the water could not get across, it was stopped by something invisible, and it turned away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1987">Moreover, it seemed that everything had already been prepared, as if the way had been made to divert the water.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1988">There, down below me, below the vehicle, I had the impression that it was the earth, it really seemed like the earth, and the water was rushing down towards it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1989">The vehicle's path was not on earth, but up above (probably in interstellar regions!), a special path for this vehicle. And I didn't</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page397">Page 397</p>
<p class="PE"> know where the water was coming from; I couldn't see its origin, which was off beyond the horizon. But it came raging down in torrents ‚Äì not precipitously like a waterfall, but rather like a rushing torrent. My path passed between the torrents of water and the earth below. And I saw the water before me, everywhere, in front and behind ‚Äì it was so extraordinary, for it looked like... it was everywhere, you see, except along my path (and even then, there was some seepage). Water speeding everywhere. But there was a kind of conscious will in this onrush, and I had to reach the Great Passage before this conscious will. This water resembled something physical, but there was a consciousness, a conscious will, and I had to... it was like a battle between the will I represented and that will. And I passed each fissure just in time. Only when I reached the Great Turning did I see the will that impelled this water. And I reached there just before it. And passed through at a fantastic speed ‚Äì like lightning. Even time ceased... I crossed over like a flash of lightning. And then, suddenly, respite ‚Äì and it was blue. A square.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1990">At the time, I didn't know what it all meant. Then this morning, I thought, ‚ÄúIt must have something to do with the world situation.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1991">It had all the dimensions of something almost... the earth seemed small in comparison, you see. It was similar to what happens here when water is unleashed on earth, during floods for instance, but on a much greater scale.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1992">What was pleasing, and really quite interesting, was this tremendous speed, like an arrow, and I always arrived in time, just in time, just in time. Once I had crossed over to the other side (I clearly felt that nothing would be left, for it was such a powerful deluge), the danger was finished, there was no longer <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ANY</span> possibility at all of being touched ‚Äì this was the main feeling. Everything was stopped. Nothing could touch.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1993">I turned around and saw all this water rushing down, and I thought, ‚ÄúNow let's see if we can do something here.‚Äù There was someone behind who interested me, someone or something ‚Äì it was still something; it was very likeable and had something of the blue color that was here on the other side. Not really individuals, but more like beings representative of something that was following me quite closely. When I was there, it also was there, but it could not keep up, it kept losing ground ‚Äì as my speed increased, its decreased. It could not keep up. But it interested me in a special way. ‚ÄúOh, he's so close (he or it); he might just make it,‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page398">Page 398</p>
<p class="PE"> I thought. And at that moment, I saw that all this destructive will with its instrument of water, symbolically water, had rushed past and was spreading out everywhere. But there was still a chance of saving all those who were along this path. And that's immediately what I thought of, it was my first wish: ‚ÄúLet's see if they can still get across, if I can manage to get them across.‚Äù I remembered some especially dangerous spots (while speeding past, I had remarked, ‚ÄúOh, here we might still be able to do this, there that could still be done‚Äù ‚Äì my consciousness moved at the same speed, and I noted everything along the way), and once I was firmly there on the other side, I started sending back messages.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1994">Down below, the water was having a grand time; it was... it was hopeless. But here, along this path, there was still a hope, even... even after the water had passed; I probably had a certain power at my disposal to help others cross these fissured places. But because I woke up, I didn't see what it was. So that stopped everything. Probably because I woke up rather abruptly, I could not see what it meant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1995">All this is a translation in human language, actually, because really it was...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1996">And it happened quite early in the night ‚Äì at such an early hour, they are not visions or things you observe: they are things you do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-1997">I've been seeing for a long time that nights are actions. They are no longer images or symbols or representations ‚Äì they are all actions. And they take place certainly not on a human scale.</p>

So after describing things at some length, he asked my opinion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2001">Logically, according to reason, war seems unavoidable. But as he asked, I looked ‚Äì I looked at my nights, precisely, as well as other things. And then I said, ‚ÄúI don't feel it. I don't feel any war.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2002">And again this morning, when I looked at this vision, I asked myself, ‚ÄúWill there be war?‚Äù ‚Äì I don't feel it will be like that... It may be worse.</p>

<p class="PE"> You see, it didn't seem human.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2003">I remember wandering about one night some time ago. It's no longer very clear, but one thing has remained ‚Äì I had gone out of India, and then when I returned to India, I found huge elephants installed <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYWHERE</span> ‚Äì enormous elephants. At that time I was not at all aware that the Communists in India had adopted the elephant as their symbol; I only learned that later. ‚ÄúWhat does this mean,‚Äù I said to myself. ‚ÄúDoes it signify the Indian army?‚Äù But they did not resemble war elephants. These elephants were like immense mammoths, and they looked like they were settling down with all the power of a tremendous inertia. That was the impression ‚Äì something heavy in an inert and very tamasic way, forever immovable. I did not like this occupation. When I came back, I had a rather painful feeling, and for several days I wondered if it did not mean war. Then by chance, in a conversation, I learned that the Communists had selected the elephant as their symbol whereas the Congress had chosen the bullock... In my vision, I was moving (as I always do), I was moving among them, and nothing moved. And if I needed room, some of them even tried to stir a little.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2004">But when human beings are involved, I believe that visions take on a special form ‚Äì it's a special image. Not an inundation like this.

<p class="PE"> I woke up at three o'clock (what I mean is, I came out of my nightly activities). I had an hour ahead of me before getting up. So I concentrated and went within.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2028">I came out of the concentration at 4:10 ‚Äì quite late. For I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> busy! I was in some sort of small house similar to my room, but it was at the top of a tower, for you could see the landscape from above. It was similar to my room here, with large windows. And I was much taller than I actually am, for there was a ledge below each window (there was a cupboard below each window, as in my room), and this ledge came quite low on me; in my room, it comes up to my chest, whereas it was much lower in my vision. And from there... oh, what beautiful landscapes! It was surrounded by such lovely countryside!... There was a flowing river, woods, sunlight ‚Äì oh, it was really lovely! And I was very busy looking up words in the dictionary!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2029">I had taken out a dictionary. ‚ÄúThere, it's this one,‚Äù I said. Someone was next to me, but this someone is always symbolic: each activity takes on a special form which may resemble someone or other. (The people around me for the work here are like families in those worlds there; they are types, that is ‚Äì each person represents a type ‚Äì so then I know that I'm in contact with all the people of this same type. If they were conscious, they would know that I was there telling them something in particular. But it's not a person, it's a type ‚Äì and not a type of character, but a type of activity and relationship with me.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2030">I was with a certain ‚Äútype,‚Äù and I was looking for a word, I wanted to conjugate the verb <em>vaincre</em> [to conquer]: <em>je vaincs, tu vaincs, il</em> vainc ‚Äì good, now <em>nous vainquons</em>, how do you spell that, <em>nous vainquons?</em> It was so funny! And I was looking it up in the dictionary ‚Äì vainquons, how do you spell that?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2031">And at the same time, I had the feeling of something completely arbitrary, and all this kind of knowledge seemed so unreal ‚Äì a completely arbitrary convention corresponding to nothing luminous anywhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2032">I was very... oh, I was very, very anxious to know how <em>je vaincs, tu vaincs</em> goes... <em>nous vainquons, vous vainquez</em>. And I woke up at 4:15... without having found it in the dictionary!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2033">Then when I woke up, I immediately said to myself, ‚ÄúHmm, it's</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page403">Page 403</p>
<p class="PE"> true ‚Äì how would I spell that?‚Äù It took me half a minute to remember. It was really funny!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2034">Coming at the end of the night as it did, it means that it's an exploration in some part or another of a subconscious mental activity. And you can make so many discoveries there... it is unbelievable! But it's lovely. And rarely unpleasant. There was a time when it was very unpleasant, oppressive, full of effort and resistance. I would want to go somewhere, but it would be impossible; I toiled and struggled, but everything would go wrong ‚Äì the straight paths would suddenly plunge into an abyss, and I'd have to cross the abyss. For years it was like that. Just recently, I looked back over this whole period... But now it is over. Now it's something... it's lovely, it's enjoyable, it's a little... it has a childlike simplicity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2035">However, it's not a personal subconscient, but a... it's more than the Ashram. For me, the Ashram is not a separate individuality ‚Äì except in that vision the other day,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="173" href="#">1</a> which is what surprised me. It's hardly that. Rather, it is still this Movement of everything, of everything that is included. So it's like entering into the subconscient of the whole earth, and it takes on forms which are quite familiar images to me, but they are absolutely symbolic and very, very funny! It took a moment to see that <em>vainquons is</em> spelled q-u-o-n-s. And I wasn't sure! I meant to ask Pavitra for a dictionary which gives verb conjugations, for then if I'm stuck on something while writing, I can look it up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2036">The other day I wrote something ‚Äì it was a letter I gave Pavitra to read. ‚ÄúI think there's a spelling mistake,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt's quite possible,‚Äù I answered, ‚ÄúI make plenty of them.‚Äù He looked it up in a splendid dictionary and, as a matter of fact, it was a mistake. I meant to ask him for a dictionary this morning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2037">It's very simple, actually; it's a convention, a conventional construction somewhere in the subconscious brain, and you write automatically. But if you want to try to bring the light of a slightly higher reason into it, it's terrible. It becomes meaningless, and you forget everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2038">You have to be inside this automatic convention to remember; it's very difficult <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs)</em>. So I</span>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2051">I answered. The letters must have left. I wrote (in English) that it's not so much a question of organization as of attitude ‚Äì to begin with.

This is what I call 
‚Äústudying.‚Äù Then, after having read the corresponding works, you compare them with what Sri Aurobindo has said, and in this way there may be a beginning of understanding.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2139"><em>X has spoken to me several times of his lack of esteem for most people in the Ashram: ‚ÄúWhy does Mother keep all these empty pots?‚Äù he says.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2140">If he imagines for one moment that I believe all the people here are doing sadhana, he is grossly mistaken!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2141">The idea is that the earth as a whole must be prepared in all its forms, including even those least ready for the transformation. There must be a symbolic representation of all the elements on earth upon which we can work to establish the link.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="187" href="#">1</a> The earth is a symbolic representation of the universe, and the group is a symbolic representation of the earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2142">Sri Aurobindo and I had discussed the matter in 1914 (quite a long time ago), for we had seen two possibilities: what we are now doing, or to withdraw into solitude and isolation until we had not only attained the Supermind, but begun the material transformation as well. And Sri Aurobindo rightfully said that we could not isolate ourselves, for as you progress, you become more and more universalized, and consequently... you <em>take the burden upon yourself</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="188" href="#">2</a> in any case.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2143">And life itself has responded by bringing people forward to form a nucleus. Of course, we clearly saw that this would make the work a bit more complex and difficult (it gives me a heavy</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page416">Page 416</p>
<p class="PE"> responsibility, an enormous material work), but from the overall point of view ‚Äì for the Work ‚Äì it's indispensable and even inevitable. And in any case, as we were later able to verify, each one represents simultaneously a possibility and a special difficulty to resolve. I have even said, I believe, that each one here is an impossibility.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="189" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2144">But this way of seeing is too far removed from the state of mind and spiritual education in which X has lived,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="190" href="#">4</a> of course, for him to understand. Nor am I in favor of proselytizing 
[to convince X)] it would disturb him quite needlessly. He has not come here for that. He came here for something special, something I wanted which he brought, and I have learnt it. Now it's excellent, he is a part of the group in his own fashion, that's all. And in a certain way, his presence here is having a very good effect on a whole category of people who had not been touched but who are now becoming more and more favorably inclined. It was difficult to reach all the traditionalists, for example, the people attached to the old spiritual forms; well, they seem now to have been touched by something.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2145">When Amrita,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="191" href="#">5</a> seized with zeal, wanted to make him understand what we were doing here and what Sri Aurobindo had wanted, it almost erupted into an unpleasant situation. So after that, I decided to identify myself with him to see ‚Äì I had never done this, because normally I only do it when I am responsible for someone, in order to truly help someone, and I've never felt any responsibility in regard to X. So I wanted to see his inner situation, what could and could not be done. That was the day you saw him coming down from our meditation in an ecstatic state, when he told you that all separation between him and me had dropped away ‚Äì it was to be expected, I anticipated as much!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2146">But when I did that, I saw what X wanted to do for me. As a matter of fact, I recalled that when we first met I had told him that everything was all right up to this point <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the region above the head)</em></span>, but below that, in the outer being, I wanted to hasten the transformation, and things there were difficult to handle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2147">When Sri Aurobindo was here, I never bothered about all this; I was constantly up above and I did what the <em>Gita</em> and the traditional writings advise ‚Äì I left it to Nature's care. In fact I left it to</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page417">Page 417</p>
<p class="PE"> Sri Aurobindo's care. ‚ÄúHe is making the best use of it,‚Äù I would say. ‚ÄúHe will manage it, he will do with it what he wants.‚Äù And I was constantly up above. And from up there I worked, leaving the instrument as it was because I knew that he would see to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2148">Actually, it was very different at that time because I was not even aware of any resistance or any difficulty in the outer being; it was automatic, the work was done automatically. Later on, when I had to do both things ‚Äì what he had been doing as well as what I was doing ‚Äì it became rather complicated and I realized there were many... what we could call ‚Äúgaps‚Äù ‚Äì things which had to be worked out, transformed, set right before the total work could be done without hindrance. So then I began. And several times I thought how unfortunate it was that I had never studied or pursued certain ancient Indian disciplines. Because, for example, when Sri Aurobindo and I were working to bring down the supramental forces, a descent from the mental plane to the vital plane, he was always telling me that everything I did (when we ‚Äúmeditated‚Äù together, when we worked) ‚Äì all my movements, all my gestures, all my postures, all my reactions ‚Äì was absolutely tantric, as if I had pursued a tantric discipline. But it was spontaneous, it did not correspond to any knowledge, any idea, any will, nothing, and I thought it was like that simply because, as He knew, naturally I followed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2149">Later on, when Sri Aurobindo left his body, I said to myself, ‚ÄúIf only I knew what he had known, it would be easier!‚Äù So when Swami and later X came, I thought, ‚ÄúI am going to take advantage of this opportunity.‚Äù I had written to Swami that I was working on transforming the cells of the body and that I had noticed the work was going faster with X's influence. So it was understood that X would help when he came ‚Äì that's how things began, and this idea has remained with X. But I have raced on ‚Äì I don't wait. I've raced on, I've gone like wildfire. And now the situation is reversed. What I wanted to find out, I found out. I experienced what I wanted to experience, but he is still... He is very kind, actually, he wants really to help me. So, when I identified with him the other day during our meditation, I realized that he wanted to give silence, control and perfect peace to the physical mind. My own ‚Äútrick,‚Äù if you will, is to have as little relationship with the physical mind as possible, to go up above and stay there ‚Äì this <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates her forehead)</em></span>, silent, motionless, turned upwards, while That <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture above the head)</em></span> sees, acts, knows, decides ‚Äì all is done from there. Only there can you feel at ease.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page418">Page 418</p>
<p class="PE"> Along the way, I once went down into this physical mind for awhile to try to set it right, to organize it a little (it was done rather quickly, I didn't stay there long). So when I went inside X, I saw... It was rather curious, for it's the opposite of the method we follow. In his material consciousness (physical and vital), he has trained himself to be impersonal, open, limitless, in communication with all the universal forces. In the physical mind, silence, immobility. But in the speculative mind, the one there at the very top of the head... what an organization, phew!... All the tradition in its most superb organization, but such a ri-gi-di-ty! And it had a pretty quality of light, a silver blue ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> pretty. Oh, it was very calm, wonderfully calm and quiet and still. But what a ceiling it had! ‚Äì the outer form resembled rigid cubes. Everything inside was beautiful, but that... There was a very large cube right at the top, I recall, bordered by a purple line, which is a line of power ‚Äì all this was quite luminous. It looked like a pyramid; the smaller cubes formed a kind of base, the lower part of which faded into something cloudy, and then this passed imperceptibly downwards to a more material realm, or in other words, the physical mind. The cube on top was the largest and most luminous, and the least yielding ‚Äì even inflexible, you could say. The others were somewhat less defined, and at the bottom it was very blurred. But up at the top! ‚Äì that's where I wanted to go, right to the top.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2150">When I got there, I felt a moment of anguish; my feeling was that nothing could be done. Not for him in particular, but universally, for all those in his category ‚Äì it seemed <em>hopeless</em>.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="192" href="#">6</a> If that was perfection, then nothing more could be done. This lasted only a second, but it was painful. And then I tried... that is, I wanted to bring my consciousness down into the highest cube ‚Äì this eternal, universal and infinite consciousness which is the first and foremost expression of the manifestation ‚Äì but... nothing doing. It was impossible. I tried for several minutes and saw that it was absolutely impossible. So I had to make a curious movement (I couldn't get through it, it was impassable), I had to come back down into the so-called lower consciousness (not lower, actually ‚Äì it was vast and impersonal), and from there I came out and regained... my equilibrium. This is what gave me that splitting headache I told you about. I came out of there as if I were carrying the weight... the weight of an irreducible absolute ‚Äì it was</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page419">Page 419</p>
<p class="PE"> dreadful. Unfortunately, I was unable to rest afterwards, and as people were waiting to see me, I had to talk ‚Äì which is very tiring for me. And this produced a bubbling in my head, like a... this dark blue light of power in matter was there, shot through with streaks of white and gold, and all this was flashing back and forth in my head, this way and that way ‚Äì I thought I was going to have a stroke! <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs)</em></span></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2151">This lasted a good half hour before I could calm it down, make it quiet, quiet. And I saw that this came from the fact that he wanted to bring the Power down, to transmit the Power into the physical mind! But as soon as I'm put in contact with the Power, you understand, it makes everything explode! <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs)</em></span> It felt exactly like my head was going to explode!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2152">I felt better that night because I was concentrated, but my head was still hurting a little. Then the following day I said to myself, or rather I told him inwardly, ‚ÄúWhether you like it or not, I am bringing down what's up above; it is the only way I can feel comfortable!‚Äù And I told you what happened ‚Äì as soon as I sat down I was so surprised, for he didn't start doing what he had done the day before; I myself did the same thing, I... participated, so to speak, in his will (so as to find out), but with the resolve to remain consciously in contact with the highest consciousness, as always, and to bring it down. And it came in a marvelous flood. He was quite happy, he did not protest!... All the pain was gone, there was nothing left, it was perfect. Only towards the end of the meditation did he again want to start doing his little trick of enclosing my physical mind in this construction, but it didn't last ‚Äì I watched all this from above.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2153">And he isn't aware of this, actually, he isn't aware at all. If he were told, he would absolutely deny it ‚Äì for him, it's an opening onto Infinity!... But in fact, it's always like that, we are always shut in, each of us ‚Äì each one is enclosed inside certain limits which he doesn't feel, for should he feel it, he would get out! Oh, I know this feeling very well, for when I was with Sri Aurobindo I was open in this way <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture towards the heights)</em></span>, and I always had this feeling of ‚ÄúYes, my child...‚Äù ‚Äì He tolerated me the way I was and waited for it to change. That's truly how things are, you know. And now I feel my limits, which are the limits of the world as it is at present, but beyond that there's an unmanifested immensity, eternity and infinity ‚Äì to which we are closed. It merely seeps in ‚Äì it is not the great opening. What I am trying to bring about is the great opening. Only when it has opened wide will</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page420">Page 420</p>
<p class="PE"> there really be the... (how should I put it?) the irreducible thing, and all the world's resistance, all its inertia, even its obscurity will be unable to swallow it up ‚Äì the determining and transforming thing... I don't know when it will come.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2154">But this experience with X was really interesting. I learned many things that day, many things... If you concentrate long enough on any one point, you discover the Infinite (and in his own experience he found the infinite), what could be called your own Infinite. But this is not what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WE</span> want, not this; what we want is the direct and integral contact between the manifested universe and the Infinite out of which this universe has emerged. So then it is no longer an individual or personal contact with the Infinite, it's a total contact. And Sri Aurobindo insists on this, he says that it's absolutely impossible to have the transformation (not the contact, but the supramental transformation) without becoming universalized ‚Äì that is the first condition. You cannot become supramental before being universal. And to be universal means to accept everything, be everything, become everything ‚Äì really to accept everything. And as for all those who are shut up in a system, even if it belongs to the highest regions of thought, it is not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2155">But to each his destiny, to each his work, to each his realization, and to want to change someone's destiny or someone's realization is very wrong. For it simply throws him off balance ‚Äì that's all it does.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2156"><em>But for us who want an integral realization, are all these mantras and this daily japa really a help, or do they also shut us in?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2157">It gives discipline. It's an almost subconscious discipline of the character more than of thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2158">Especially at the beginning, Sri Aurobindo used to shatter to pieces all moral ideas (you know, as in the <em>Aphorisms</em>, for example). He shattered all those things, he shattered them, really shattered them to pieces. So there's a whole group of <em>youngsters</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="193" href="#">7</a> here who were brought up with this idea that ‚Äúwe can do whatever we want, it doesn't matter in the least!‚Äù ‚Äì that they need not bother about all those concepts of ordinary morality. I've had a hard time making them understand that this morality can be abandoned only for a higher one... So, one has to be careful not to give them the Power too soon.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page421">Page 421</p>
<p class="PE"> It's an almost physical discipline. Moreover, I have seen that the japa has an organizing effect on the subconscient, on the inconscient, on matter, on the body's cells ‚Äì it takes time, but by persistently repeating it, in the long run it has an effect. It is the same principle as doing daily exercises on the piano, for example. You keep mechanically repeating them, and in the end your hands are filled with consciousness ‚Äì it fills the body with consciousness.</p>

<p class="PE"> ‚Äì it came to my forehead, which gave me a little protection... I didn't say anything, I didn't think anything, try anything, want anything ‚Äì I merely sat near him.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2167">Oh, I had tried ‚Äì for years I had tried to catch silence in my head... I never succeeded. I could detach myself from it, but it would keep on turning...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2169">Afterwards, I kept very still so as not to disturb it. I didn't speak, above all I refrained from thinking and held it, held it tight against me ‚Äì I said to myself, ‚Äúmake it last, make it last, make it last...‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2170">Later on, I heard Sri Aurobindo saying that there were two people here to whom he had done this and as soon as there was silence, they panicked: ‚ÄúMy God, I've gone stupid!!‚Äù And they threw it all overboard by starting to think again.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2174">I went to inaugurate the sugar factory<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="195" href="#">9</a> the other day. I had an amusing experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2175">From the material point of view, it's almost hellish ‚Äì the noise,</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page423">Page 423</p>
<p class="PE"> the smell ‚Äì a nauseating smell. I had to apply all my will not to be physically disturbed ‚Äì they made me climb up narrow little stairs, go down, climb back up, look into deep pits. At some places there weren't even guardrails, so I had really to control myself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2176">I was watching all this sugar cane ‚Äì piles of sugar cane ‚Äì which is thrown into the machine, and then it travels along and falls down to be crushed, crushed, and crushed some more. And then it comes back up to be distilled. And then I saw... all this is living when it's thrown in, you see, it's full of its vital force, for it has just been cut. As a result, the vital force is suddenly hurled out of the substance with an extreme violence ‚Äì the vital force comes out... the English word <em>angry is</em> quite expressive of what I mean ‚Äì like a snarling dog. <em>An angry force</em>.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="196" href="#">10</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2177">So I saw this ‚Äì I saw it moving about. And it kept coming and coming and coming, accumulating, piling up (they work 24 hours a day, six days a week ‚Äì only on the seventh do they rest). So I thought that this angry force must have some effect on the people ‚Äì who knows, maybe this is what creates accidents. For I could see that once the sugar cane was fully crushed and had gone back up the chute, this force that had been beaten out was right there. And this worried me a little; I thought that there must be a certain danger in doing such a thing!... What saves them is their ignorance and their insensitivity. But Indians are never entirely insensitive in the way Westerners are ‚Äì they are much more open in their subconscious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2178">I didn't speak of it to anyone, but it caused me some concern. And just the next day the machine broke down! When I was informed, immediately I thought... It was then repaired, and again it broke down ‚Äì three times. Then the following night, just before ten o'clock... I should mention that during the day I had thought, ‚ÄúBut why not attract these forces to our side, take them and satisfy them, give them some peace and joy and use them?‚Äù I thought about it, concentrated a little, but then I didn't bother any further. At ten o'clock that evening, they came upon me ‚Äì in a flood! They kept coming and coming. And I was busy with them the whole time. They were not ugly (not so luminous either!), they were wholesome, straightforward ‚Äì honest forces. So I worked on them. This began exactly at 9:30, and for one hour I was busy working. After an hour, I'd had enough: ‚ÄúListen, this is quite fine, you're very nice, but I can't spend all my time like this! We shall</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page424">Page 424</p>
<p class="PE"> see what to do later‚Äù ‚Äì for it absorbed my whole consciousness. They kept coming and coming (you understand what that means to a body?!). So at 10:30 I told them, ‚ÄúListen, my little ones, be quiet now, that's enough for today...‚Äù At 10:30, the machine broke down!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2179">I found out, of course, because they log everything at the factory, so when they came to inform me of the breakdown the next morning, I asked them what time it had happened ‚Äì exactly 10:30.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2180">After that, I made a kind of pact with them ‚Äì the trouble, you see, is that there are constantly new ones. If only they were the same! They are constantly coming in new floods, so there was the need of a permanent formation over there. I've tried to make this permanent formation, to take and absorb them, to calm them down and scatter them a little so they don't accumulate in one spot, which in the end could be dangerous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2181">I found this quite amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2182">The most recent incident took place a few days ago, for there was a general excitement in the factory due to the expected visit of a government minister during the day. That afternoon, exactly at half past three, I felt that I had to make a little concentration. So I paid attention and saw poor L<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="197" href="#">11</a> praying to me. He was praying, praying, calling me ‚Äì such a strong call that it pulled me. I was having my bath (you know what happens when I'm very strongly pulled ‚Äì I'm stopped right in the very midst of a gesture, then the consciousness goes wandering off! And I can't do anything, it stops me dead. That's exactly what happened to me in the bathroom). When I saw what was happening, I straightened things out. Then they must have had their ceremony, for suddenly I felt, ‚ÄúAh, now it has calmed down, it's all right.‚Äù And I went on to something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2183">The next day, L came to see me. He told me that shortly before 3:30, the machine had stopped once again, but this time it was quickly set right; they found out right away what had to be done. And then he told me that at 3:45 he had started praying to me that all should go well. ‚ÄúOh, I know!‚Äù I said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2184">Things can be done in this way. In truth, a lot can be done ‚Äì it's man's ignorance that gets him in trouble.</p>

But then, you know, with all that's coming you could write volumes!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2194">From a documentary standpoint, my nights are getting quite interesting. In the <em>Yoga of Self-Perfection</em>, Sri Aurobindo describes precisely this state you reach in which all things assume meaning and a quality of inner significance, clarification of various points, and help. From this point of view, my nights have become extraordinary. I see infinitely more things than I saw before. Before, it was very limited to a personal contact with people. Now... In my nights, each thing and each person has the appearance, the gesture, the word or the action that describes <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EXACTLY</span> his condition. It's becoming quite interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2195">Of course, I much prefer being in my great currents of force ‚Äì from a personal standpoint, such immensity of action is much more interesting. But these documentary things are also valuable. It is so tremendously different from the dreams and even the visions you have when you enter certain representative realms of the mind (which is what I used to do). It is so different, it has another content, another life altogether: it carries its light, its understanding, its explanation within itself ‚Äì you look, and everything is explained.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2196">It always gives me the feeling that I am shrinking a little, but it's interesting. And it's useful, for I am constantly moving about and doing things with people; it indicates to me what I have to say and do with each one. It's useful. But all the same, I miss the fullness and joy of the more impersonal Movement of forces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2197">Before going to bed, sometimes I say to myself, ‚ÄúI will do what is necessary to spend my night in these great currents of force‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page427">Page 427</p>
<p class="PE"> (because there is a way to do it). And then I think, ‚ÄúOh, what an egotist you are, my girl!‚Äù So sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't ‚Äì when there's something important to do, it doesn't happen. But all I have to do is concentrate in a certain way before going to sleep to spend my whole night in these... very far from here, very far... I can't say very far from the earth, for surely it's in an intermediate zone between the forces from above and the earth's atmosphere. That's what it mainly is, in any case. It's a great universal current as well, but mainly it's what descends and comes onto the earth, and it is permeating the earth's atmosphere all the time, all the time, and it comes with this wide, overall vision ‚Äì it makes for wonderful nights... I no longer bother about people at all ‚Äì at least not as such, but in a more impersonal way.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2198">I have been pestered my whole life by... something similar to the sense of duty without its stupidity. Sri Aurobindo had told me that it was a ‚Äúcensor,‚Äù that I had with me a ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù one! It was constantly, constantly telling me, ‚ÄúNo, it's not like that, it's like this... Oh, no! It's wrong to do that; be careful, don't be egotistical; be careful ‚Äì do this, do that.‚Äù He was right, but I sent it away long ago ‚Äì or rather, Sri Aurobindo sent it away. But there remains the habit... of not doing what I like. Rather, of doing what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> be done, and whether it's pleasant or not makes no difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2199">This, too, Sri Aurobindo had explained to me. I used to tell him, ‚ÄúYes, you always speak of life's ‚Äòdelight,‚Äô life for the sake of its delight.‚Äù But as soon as I had the notion, as soon as I was put in the presence of the Supreme, it was: ‚ÄúFor You ‚Äì exclusively what You want. You are the sole, the unique and exclusive reason for being.‚Äù And that has remained, and this movement is so strong that even when... you see, now I have ecstasy and ananda in abundance ‚Äì everything comes, everything. But even then, even when that is there, something in me always turns towards the Supreme and says, ‚ÄúDoes this <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRULY</span> serve You? Is it what You expect of me, what You want from me?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2200">This has protected me from all seeking for pleasure in life. It was a wonderful protection, because pleasure always seemed so futile to me ‚Äì yes, futile; for the sake of your personal satisfaction. Later, I even understood how foolish it is, for you can never be satisfied ‚Äì though when you're small you don't yet know that. I</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page428">Page 428</p>
<p class="PE"> never liked it: ‚ÄúBut is it really useful, does it serve some purpose?‚Äù And I still have this attitude in regard to my nights. I have this widening of the consciousness, this impersonalization, this wonderful joy of being above... all that. But at the same time I also have, ‚ÄúI'm here in this body, on earth, to do something ‚Äì I mustn't forget it. And this is what I have to do.‚Äù But probably I'm wrong!...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2211">For the placement of words is not the same in English and in French. In English, for example, the place an adverb occupies is of major importance for the precise meaning. In French also, but generally it's not the same! If at least it were exactly the opposite of English it would be easier, but it's not exactly the opposite. It's the same thing for the word order in a series of modifiers or any string of words; usually in English, for example, the most important word comes first and the least important last. In French, it's usually the opposite ‚Äì but it doesn't always work!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2212">The spirit of the two languages is not the same. Something always escapes.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2214">I also read <em>On the Veda</em> where Sri Aurobindo speaks of the difference between the modern mind and the ancient mind; and it's quite obvious, especially from the linguistic point of view.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2224">It happened this morning while I was walking back and forth in my room. I had finished my japa... I had to stop and hold my head in my hands to keep from bursting into tears. ‚ÄúNo, it is too dreadful,‚Äù I said to myself; ‚Äúand to think that we want Perfection!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2225">Then naturally there came as a consolation: only because the consciousness is getting closer to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE REAL THING</span> can it see all this wretchedness, and the contrast alone makes these things appear so mean.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2226">And it's true, those things I saw this morning which seemed so... above all stupid and ugly (I've never had a sense of morality at any time in my life, thank God! But stupid and ugly things have always seemed... I've always done my best to distance myself from them, even when I was very small). And now I see that these things which seem not only ridiculous but, well, almost shameful were considered, as I recall, remarkably noble earlier on and they represented an exceptionally lofty attitude in life ‚Äì the very same things. So then I understood that it's quite simply a question of proportion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2227">And that's how the world is ‚Äì things which now seem totally unacceptable to us, things we <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> tolerate, were quite all right in the past.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2228">The day before yesterday, I spent the whole night looking on. I had read the passage by Sri Aurobindo in <em>The Synthesis</em> on ‚Äúsupramental time‚Äù (wherein past, present and future coexist in a global consciousness). While you're in it, it's marvelous! You understand things perfectly. But when you're not in it... Above all, there's this problem of how to keep the force of one's aspiration, the power of progress, this power which seems so inevitable ‚Äì so inevitable if existence (let's simply take terrestrial existence) is to mean anything and its presence to be justified. (This ascending movement towards a progressive ‚Äúbetter‚Äù that will be eternally better) ‚Äì How is this to be kept when you have the total vision... this vision in which everything coexists. At that moment, the other becomes something like a game, an amusement, if</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page432">Page 432</p>
<p class="PE"> you will. (Not everyone finds it amusing!) And when you contain all that, why allow yourself the pleasure of succession?... Is this pleasure of succession, of seeing things one after the other, equal to this intensity of the will for progress?... Words are foolish!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2229">The effort to see and to understand this gripped me all night. And when I woke up this morning, I thanked the Lord; I said to Him, ‚ÄúObviously, if You were to keep me totally in that consciousness, I could no longer... I could no longer do my work!‚Äù How could I do my work? For I can only say something to people when I feel it or see it, when I see that it's what must be said, but if I am simultaneously in a consciousness in which I'm aware of everything that has led to that situation, everything that is going to happen, everything I'm going to say, everything the other's going to feel ‚Äì then how could I do it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2230">There are still many hundreds of years to go before it becomes entirely what Sri Aurobindo describes ‚Äì there's no hurry!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2231"><em>The mental silence Sri Aurobindo gave you in 1914, about which you were speaking the other day...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2232">It has never left. I have always kept it. Like a smooth white surface turned upwards. And at any moment at all... You see, we speak like a machine, but there nothing moves; at any moment at all it can turn towards the heights. It's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS</span> turned like that, but we can become aware of it being like that. Then, if we listen, we can hear what comes from above. My active consciousness, which was here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother points to her forehead)</em></span>, has settled above, and it has never again moved from there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2233">I told this to X ‚Äì or rather had someone tell him ‚Äì to see his reaction. And I realized that he did not understand in the least! Once Amrita asked him how he himself <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAW</span> and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNEW</span> things. So he tried to explain; he told Amrita that he had to pull his consciousness upwards by a gradual effort, to go beyond the heart, beyond the throat center... to pull it right up here <span class="note_1"><em>(the top of the head)</em></span>, and once there, you're divine, you know! All of a sudden, I understood that when I said it was there, above the head, it must have seemed absolutely impossible to him! For him, it's the <em>crown of the head</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="204" href="#">1</a> (what they call the thousand-petalled lotus), just at the top of the head, whereas in my experience it opens, it rises and you go above, and then you settle there... For a</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page433">Page 433</p>
<p class="PE"> number of years it even changed my [physical] vision ‚Äì it was as if I were looking at things from above. It returns from time to time, too, as if suddenly I were seeing from above instead of from here, at eye level.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2234">But the faculty of forming thoughts is now there, up above; it's no longer here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother points to her forehead)</em></span>. And that's contrary to their teachings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2235">The tantrics recognize seven chakras,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="205" href="#">2</a> I believe. Th√©on said he knew of more, specifically two below the body and three above. That is my experience as well ‚Äì I know of twelve chakras. And really, the contact with the Divine Consciousness is there <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother motions above the head)</em></span>, not here <span class="note_1"><em>(at the top of the head)</em></span>. One must surge up above.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2236"><em>Doing japa seems to exert a pressure on my physical consciousness, which goes on turning! How can I silence it? As soon as my concentration is not absolute, the physical mind starts up ‚Äì it grabs at anything, anything at all, any word, fact or event that comes along, and it starts turning, turning. If you stop it, if you put some pressure on it, then it springs back up two minutes later... And there is no inner consent at all. It chews on words, it chews on ideas or feelings ‚Äì interminably. What should I do?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2237">Yes, it's the physical mind. The japa is made precisely to control the physical mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2238">I myself use it for a very special reason, because... You see, I invoke (the words are a bit strange)... the Lord of Tomorrow. Not the unmanifest Lord, but the Lord as he will manifest ‚Äútomorrow,‚Äù or in Sri Aurobindo's words, the divine manifestation in its supramental form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2239">So the first sound of my mantra is the call to that, the evocation. With the second sound, the body's cells make their ‚Äúsurrender,‚Äù they give themselves. And with the third sound comes the identification of this [the body] with That, which produces the divine life. These are my three sounds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2240">And in the beginning, during the first months that I was doing the japa, I felt them... I had an almost detailed awareness of</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page434">Page 434</p>
<p class="PE"> these myriads of cells opening to this vibration; the vibration of the first sound is an absolutely special vibration (you see, above, there is the light and all that, but beyond this light there is the original vibration), and this vibration was entering into all the cells and was reproduced in them. It went on for months in this way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2241">Even now, when something or other is not all right, I have only to reproduce the thing with the same type of concentration as at the beginning... for, when I say the japa, the sound and the words together ‚Äì the way the words are understood, the feel of the words ‚Äì create a certain totality. I have to reproduce that. And the way it's repeated is evolving all the time. The words are the same, however, the original sound is the same, but it's all constantly evolving towards a more comprehensive realization and a more and more complete <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">STATE</span>. So when I want to obtain a certain result, I reproduce a certain type of this state. For example, if something in the body is not functioning right (it can't really be called an illness, but when something's out of order), or if I wish to do some specific work on a specific person for a specific reason, then I go back to a certain state of repetition of my mantra, which acts directly on the body's cells. And then the same phenomenon is reproduced ‚Äì exactly the same extraordinary vibration which I recognized when the supramental world descended. It comes in and vibrates like a pulsation in the cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2242">But as I told you, now my japa is different. It is as if I were taking the whole world to lift it up; no longer is it a concentration on the body, but rather a taking of the whole world ‚Äì the entire world ‚Äì sometimes in its details, sometimes as a whole, but constantly, constantly ‚Äì to establish the Contact 
[with the supramental world].</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2243">But what you are speaking of, this sort of sound-mill, this milling of words interminably repeating the same thing, I've suddenly caught it two or three times (not very often and with long intervals). It has always seemed fantastic to me! How is it stopped?... Always in the same way. It's something that takes place outside, actually; it's not inside ‚Äì it's outside, on the surface, generally somewhere here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the temples)</em></span>, and the method is to draw your consciousness up above, to go there and remain there ‚Äì white. Always this whiteness, white like a sheet of paper, flat like a plate of glass. An absolutely flat and white and motionless surface ‚Äì white! White like luminous milk, turned upwards. Not transparent: white.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page435">Page 435</p>
<p class="PE"> When this mill starts turning ‚Äì usually it comes from this side <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the right side of the head)</em></span> 
‚Äì it takes hold of any sound or any word at all, and then it starts turning, 
harping on the same thing. This has happened to me a dozen times perhaps, but it 
doesn't come from me; it comes from outside, from someone or something or some 
particular work. So then you take it ‚Äì as if you were picking it up with 
pincers, and then... <span class="note_1"><em>(She lifts it upwards)</em></span>, then I hold it there, in this motionless white ‚Äì no need to keep it there for long!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2244">Aren't you aware of this thing up above, this white plate at the crown of the head? It's what receives intuitions. It's just like a photographic plate, and it's not even active ‚Äì things pass right through it without our even realizing it. And then if you concentrate just a little, everything stops, everything stops.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2245">A few days ago, I recall, I wanted to know something that was going to happen. I thought that with the consciousness of supramental time, I could find out... ‚ÄúI <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> find out what's going to happen. What's going to happen?‚Äù ‚Äì No answer. So I concentrated on it, which is what I usually do, I stopped everything and looked from above ‚Äì total silence. Nothing. No answer. And I felt a slight impatience: ‚ÄúBut why can't I know?!‚Äù And what came was the equivalent of (I'm translating it in words), ‚ÄúIt's none of your business!!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2246">So I understand more and more. Everything ‚Äì this whole organization, this whole aggregate, all these cells and nerves and sensors ‚Äì are all meant uniquely for the work, they have no other purpose than the work; every foolish act that is done is for the work; every stupidity that is thought is for the work; you are made the way you are because only in that way can you do the work ‚Äì and it's none of your business to seek to be somewhere else. That's my conclusion. ‚ÄúVery well, as You wish, may Your will be done!‚Äù ‚Äì No, not ‚Äúbe done‚Äù; it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span> done. As You wish, exactly as You wish!</p>

<p class="Ps"> <em>(Pavitra shows Mother a photograph of the house in which She lived in Paris, rue du Val de Gr√¢ce)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2291">Well, well! The house on Val de Gr√¢ce! It looks inhabited, the windows have curtains in them. I lived there ‚Äì a small house, really very small, with a bedroom upstairs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2292">Here, this is the kitchen; here is the living room, this is the studio. And then behind the kitchen there was a small room that I used as the dining room, and it opened onto a courtyard. Between the dining room and the kitchen there was a bathroom and a small hallway. The kitchen is here; you went up three steps and then there was this small hallway with the stairs leading up to the bedroom. Next to the bedroom was a bathroom about as big as a thimble.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2293">It is part of a huge house. There's a seven-story apartment building on each side, and the street is here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2294">It wasn't very big. The studio was rather large ‚Äì a beautiful room... That's where I received Madame David-Neel ‚Äì we saw each other nearly every evening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2295">There was a considerable library in the studio; one whole end was given over to the library ‚Äì more than two thousand books belonging to my brother. There were even the complete works of several classical writers. And I had my entire collection of the <em>Revue Cosmique</em>, and my post card collection (it was down below) ‚Äì mainly post cards of Algeria, Tlemcen, nearly 200 of them. But there were five years of the <em>Revue Cosmique</em>. And written in such a French! How funny it was!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2296">Th√©on's wife dictated it in English while she was in trance. Another English lady who was there claimed to know French like a Frenchman. ‚ÄúMyself, I never use a dictionary,‚Äù she would say, ‚ÄúI don't need a dictionary.‚Äù But then she would turn out such translations! She made all the classic mistakes of English words that mustn't be translated like that. Then it was sent to me in Paris for correcting. It was literally impossible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2297">There was this Themanlys, my brother's schoolmate; he wrote books, but he was lazy-minded and didn't want to work! So he had passed that job on to me. But it was impossible, you couldn't do a thing with it. And what words! Th√©on would invent words</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page442">Page 442</p>
<p class="PE"> for the subtle organs, the inner senses; he had found a word for each thing ‚Äì a frightful barbarism! And I took care of everything: I found the printer, corrected the proofs ‚Äì all the work for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2298">They were stories, narratives, an entire initiation in the form of stories. There was a lot in it, really a lot. She knew many things. But it was presented in such a way that it was unreadable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2299">I also wrote one or two things, experiences I had noted down; they were rather interesting, which is why I'd like to get them back. I had described some of my visions to Madame Th√©on, and then she explained their meaning to me. So I would narrate the vision and give its explanation. That was readable and interesting, because there was some symbolism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2300"><em> (Pavitra:) What was this ‚ÄúChronicle of KI‚Äù?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2301">It wasn't ‚ÄúKi‚Äù but ‚ÄúChi,‚Äù for he was the founder of China! ‚Äì those things were fantastic! The story was almost childish, but there was a whole world of knowledge in it. Madame Th√©on was an extraordinary occultist. That woman had incredible faculties, incredible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2302">She was a small woman, fat, almost flabby ‚Äì she gave you the feeling that if you leaned against her, it would melt! Once, I remember... I was there in Tlemcen with Andre's father, who had come to join us ‚Äì a painter, an artist. Th√©on was wearing a dark purple robe. Th√©on said to him, ‚ÄúThis robe is purple.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, it's not purple,‚Äù the other answered, ‚Äúit's violet.‚Äù Th√©on went rigid: ‚ÄúWhen I say purple, it's purple!‚Äù And they started arguing over this foolishness. Suddenly there flashed from my head, ‚ÄúNo, this is too ridiculous!‚Äù ‚Äì I didn't say a word, but it went out from my head (I even saw the flash), and then Madame Th√©on got up and came over to me, stood behind me (neither of us uttered a word ‚Äì the other two were staring at each other like two angry cocks), then she laid my head against her breast ‚Äì absolutely the feeling of sinking into eiderdown!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2303">And never in my life, never, had I felt such peace ‚Äì it was absolutely luminous and soft... a peace, such a soft, tender, luminous peace. After a moment, she bent down and whispered in my ear, ‚ÄúOne must never question one's master!‚Äù It wasn't I who was questioning!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2304">She was a wonderful woman, wonderful. But as for him... well...</p>

<p class="PE"> 
It's funny... I don't know why, but a short while ago this house on Val de Gr√¢ce 
suddenly came to me... <span class="note_1"><em>(to Pavitra)</em></span> When did this photograph come?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2305">Yesterday.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2306">Suddenly the house had come into the atmosphere. ‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù I said to myself; ‚Äúsomeone is thinking about that house.‚Äù</p>
<p class="sec-br">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2307">I entered into your sleep last night. I saw you and told you certain things, I even gave you some explanations: ‚ÄúYou see, you must do it this way... you must go like this...‚Äù I also said, ‚ÄúOne day, we shall meditate together.‚Äù But more precisely, you had once spoken to me about the problem in your physical mind ‚Äì that it keeps on turning interminably ‚Äì and you had told me that it happens during your japa. So last night I told you, ‚ÄúI would like you to do your japa for a few minutes with me one day so that I may see what goes on inside you, in your physical mind.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2308">But I wasn't speaking to you with words... Everything I see at night has a special color and a special vibration. It's strange, but it looks sketched... When I said that to you, for example, there was a kind of <em>patch</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="210" href="#">1</a> a white patch, as I recall ‚Äì white, exactly like a piece of white paper ‚Äì a patch with a pink border around it, then this same blue light I keep telling you about ‚Äì deep blue ‚Äì encircling the rest, as it were. And beyond that, it was swarming ‚Äì a swarming of black and dark gray vibrations... in a terrible agitation. When I saw this, I said to you, ‚ÄúYou must repeat your mantra once in my presence so that I may see if there is anything I can do about this swarming.‚Äù And then ‚Äì I don't know why ‚Äì you objected, and this objection was red, like a tongue of fire lashing out from the white, like this <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother draws an arabesque)</em></span>. 
So I said, ‚ÄúNo, don't worry, it doesn't matter, I won't disturb a thing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="211" href="#">2</a>!‚Äù <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs mischievously)</em></span></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2309">All this took place in a realm which is constantly active, everywhere; it is like a permanent mental transcription of everything that physically takes place... They aren't actually thoughts;</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page444">Page 444</p>
<p class="PE"> when I see this, I don't really get the impression of thinking, but it's a transcription... it's the result of thoughts on a certain mental atmosphere which records things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2310">And I see it all the time now. If someone is speaking or if I'm doing something, I see the two things at the same time ‚Äì I see the physical thing, his words or my action, and then this colored, luminous transcription at the same time. The two things are superimposed. For example, when someone speaks to me, it gets translated into some kind of picture, a play of light or color (which is not always so luminous!) ‚Äì this is why most of the time, in fact, I don't even know what has been said to me. I recall the first time this phenomenon happened, I said to myself, ‚ÄúAh, so that's what these modern artists see!‚Äù Only, as they themselves aren't very coherent, what they see is not very coherent either!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2311">And that's how it works ‚Äì it is translated by patches and moving forms, which is how it gets registered in the earth's memory. So when things from this realm enter into people's active consciousness, they get translated into each one's language and the words and thoughts that each one is accustomed to ‚Äì because that doesn't belong to any language or to any idea: it is the exact <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IMPRINT</span> of what is happening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2312">I am constantly seeing this now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2313">And it is here, too, that I see the result of this confusion and excitement in the Ashram ‚Äì it jumps, jumps, jumps about. It keeps jumping on the same spot. There are machines like that ‚Äì constantly shaking; it's exasperating.</p>
<p class="sec-br">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2314">For some time now I've been experiencing a precise moment during my japa when something takes hold of me and I have all the difficulty in the world to keep from entering into trance. Yet I remain standing. Usually I'm walking, but some things I say while leaning up against the window ‚Äì not a very good place to go into trance! And it grabs me exactly at the same place each time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2315">Yesterday, I suddenly saw a huge living head of blue light ‚Äì this blue light which is the force, the powerful force in material Nature (this is the light the tantrics use). The head was made entirely of this light, and it wore a sort of tiara ‚Äì a big head, so big <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the length of her forearm)</em>;</span> its eyes weren't closed, but rather lowered, like this. The immobility of eternity, absolutely ‚Äì the repose, the immobility of eternity. A magnificent</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page445">Page 445</p>
<p class="PE"> head, quite similar to the way the gods here are represented, but even better; something between certain heads of the Buddha and... (these heads most probably come to the artists). Everything else was lost in a kind of cloud.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2316">I felt that this kind of... yes, immobility came from there: everything stops, absolutely everything stops. Silence, immobility... truly, you enter into eternity. ‚Äì I told him it wasn't time!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2317">But I tried to understand what he wanted... It's been difficult here in the Ashram for some time ‚Äì everyone is seized with a sort of frenzy, a weary restlessness. They are all writing to me, they all want to see me. It makes for such an atmosphere... I react as well as I can, but I'm not able to pass this on to them to keep them quiet (the more tired and weary you are, the more calm you ought to remain ‚Äì certainly not get excited, that's dreadful!). So I understood: this head had come to tell me, ‚ÄúThis is what you must give them.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2318">But if I were to pass that on to them, they'd all think they were becoming rattle-brained, that they were losing their faculties, that their energy was spent. For they only feel energy when they spend it. They are incapable of feeling energy in immobility ‚Äì they have to be stirring about, they have to be spending it. Or else, it has to be pounded into them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2319">I looked at this problem yesterday; it occupied me for much of the day. And I'm sure this head came to give me the solution. For me, it's very easy ‚Äì at once... three seconds, and everything stops, everything. But the others are stubborn! And yet I'm positive, I'm positive, I tell them, ‚ÄúBut relax; why are you on pins and needles like that? Relax! It's the only way to overcome your fatigue.‚Äù But they immediately start feeling that they'll lose their faculties and become inert ‚Äì the opposite of life!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2320">And this is surely what oriented my night, for I started my night looking at this problem: How can I make them accept this? For neither should they fall into the other extreme and slip from this weary agitation into <em>tamas</em>.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="212" href="#">3</a> That's obvious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2321">But how many letters I receive from people telling me, ‚ÄúI feel listless, all I want to do is sleep, to rest, not do anything.‚Äù They go on complaining.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2322">The experience I have ‚Äì what I mean by ‚ÄúI‚Äù is this aggregate here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates her body)</em></span>, this particular individuality ‚Äì is that the more quiet and calm it is, the more work it can do and</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page446">Page 446</p>
<p class="PE"> the faster the work can be done. What is most disturbing and time consuming are all these agitated vibrations that fall on me (truly speaking, each person who comes throws them on me). And this is what makes the work difficult ‚Äì it stirs up a whirlwind. And you can't do anything in this whirlwind, it's impossible. If you try to do something material, your fingers stumble; if you try to do something intellectual, your thoughts get all entangled and you no longer see clearly. I've had the experience, for example, of wanting to look up a word in the dictionary while this agitation was in the atmosphere, and everything jumps up and down (yet the lighting is the same and I'm using the same magnifying glass), I no longer see a thing, it's all jumping! I go page by page, but the word simply doesn't exist in the dictionary! Then I remain quiet, I do this... <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother makes a gesture of bringing down the Peace)</em></span> and after half a minute I open the dictionary: the very spot, and the word leaps out at me! And I see clearly and distinctly. Consequently I have now the indisputable proof that if you want to do anything properly, you must <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FIRST</span> be calm ‚Äì but not only be calm yourself; you must either isolate yourself or be capable of imposing a calm on this whirlwind of forces that comes upon you all the time from all around.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2323">All the teachers are wanting to quit the school ‚Äì weary! Which means they'll begin the year with half the teachers gone. They live in constant tension, they don't know how to relax ‚Äì that's really what it is. They don't know how to act without agitation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2324">I think that's what this head came to tell me, and it's precisely what's wrong in the Ashram ‚Äì everything here is done in agitation, absolutely everything. So it's constantly a comedy of errors; someone speaks, the other doesn't listen and responds all wrong, and nothing gets done. Someone asks one thing, another answers to something else ‚Äì bah! It's a dreadful con-fu-sion.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2325">What if we meditated a little.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2326">Sit as you normally do and... forget that I'm here!</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(After the meditation)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2327">I'm going to tell you what I saw ‚Äì it's very interesting. First, emanating from here <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother indicates the chest)</em></span>, a florescence of every color like a peacock's tail spread wide; but it was made of</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page447">Page 447</p>
<p class="PE"> light, and it was very, very delicate, very fine, like this <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture)</em></span>. Then it rose up and formed what truly seemed like a luminous peacock, up above, and it remained like that. Then, from here <span class="note_1"><em>(the chest)</em></span>, what looked like a sword of white light climbed straight up. It went up very high and formed a kind of expanse, a very vast expanse, which was like a call ‚Äì this lasted the longest. And then, in response, a veritable rain, like... (no, it was much finer than drops) a golden light ‚Äì white and golden ‚Äì with various shades, at times more towards white, at times more golden, at times with a tinge of pink. And all this was descending, descending into you. And here <span class="note_1"><em>(the chest)</em></span>, it changed into this same deep blue light, with a powdering of green light inside it ‚Äì emerald green. And at that moment, when it reached here <span class="note_1"><em>(the level of the heart)</em></span>, a number of little divinities of living gold ‚Äì a deep, living gold ‚Äì came, like this, and then looked at you. And just as they looked at you, there was the image of the Mother right at the very center of you ‚Äì not as she is commonly portrayed but as she is in the Indian consciousness... Very serene and pure and luminous. And then that changed into a temple, and inside the temple there seemed to be an image of Sri Aurobindo and an image of me ‚Äì but living images in a powdering of light. Then it grew into a magnificent edifice and settled in with an extraordinary power. And it remained motionless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2328">That is the representation of your japa.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2329">It's beautiful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2330">I had to stop because there is something like time that exists here ‚Äì what a shame!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2331">But it is very good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2332">And it shouldn't be difficult to keep that all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2333">I didn't notice you being bothered by these things of the physical mind you had mentioned. However, I had first done this <span class="note_1"><em>(gesture of cleansing the atmosphere)</em></span>, right at the beginning, so that nothing would come to disturb us... Did you feel anything?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2334"><em>I felt that you were there. I felt your Force.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2335">Ah! You felt it!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2339">There is a black cloud over the ashram. It's origin is rather unique and very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2340">S has a nephew in Bombay, and one day towards the end of August or beginning September, he told me an extraordinary story about this nephew, who had disappeared (he showed me his photograph ‚Äì he looks rather like a medium). He returned home two days later, I believe. He'd been found in a train in a hypnotic state; fortunately someone shook him and he suddenly woke up: ‚ÄúWhy am I here? What am I doing here?‚Äù (He had no intention of travelling, you see; he had simply left his house to visit a neighbor in Bombay.) So he returned home without knowing what had happened to him. And he was quite bizarre, really rather off.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2341">A few days later, this nephew had to go somewhere, I don't know where; he went down to the railway station ‚Äì and didn't return. Impossible to find out what had happened to him, he was nowhere to be found. Several days had passed when the family decided to send me his photograph and to tell me the story, adding that it was surely a sequel to the previous occurrence (there must be some people doing hypnotism), and then they asked me where he was and what had become of him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2342">All this happened just on the day X<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="213" href="#">1</a> was leaving. So I told S to take the photograph and letter to X and tell him the story. X consulted some book, did a very short japa for a few seconds and</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page449">Page 449</p>
<p class="PE"> said, ‚ÄúOh, he'll come back before September 26, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BUT</span> inform Mother so that She may see to 
it.‚Äù Therefore, I concentrated a little.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2343">About two weeks later (in other words, ten days or so before September 26), some more news ‚Äì the boy's older brother, who lives in Ahmedabad (not Bombay), came to visit his mother, father and grandmother (there's also a grandmother), and he asked about his brother. He had come with a friend. ‚ÄúYour brother has disappeared,‚Äù they explained, ‚Äúwe don't know what has happened to him.‚Äù So the two of them decided to search for him: ‚ÄúWe'll find him.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2344">The day before their departure, the elder brother's friend said he was going to visit the grandmother (she lives some hundred yards away). He went out ‚Äì and didn't return. Disappeared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2345">So of course they were terribly worried; they wondered what had happened. I had someone write to X, I concentrated, and four days later the boy (the brother's friend, that is) returned in a lamentable state: white, emaciated, barely able to speak. Then he recounted his story:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2346">On his way to the grandmother's house, he passed by the station and went in to drink something. While drinking, two persons who were there started playing with some balls in front of him. He <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WATCHED</span>. But suddenly, he felt very uneasy; he wanted to leave and ran towards an exit that opened onto the tracks ‚Äì it was closed and he could not get out. And these two people were just behind him; suddenly he lost consciousness: ‚ÄúI don't know what happened to me after that.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2347">He woke up in a railway station somewhere between Bombay and Poona, and he began telling them that he was hungry (he was with those same two persons). They punched him in the stomach and put a handkerchief over his nose ‚Äì he again passed out! At Poona, he woke up again (he'd lost his appetite by then!), and again they put the handkerchief over his nose. And it went on like that ‚Äì they kept on punching him a lot. When he woke up in the country on the outskirts of Poona, four men were around him arguing in a language he didn't know (his language is Gujarati). They were probably speaking in some other language, I don't know which one ‚Äì it seems they were very dark. He didn't understand, but from various signs they made he could see that they were arguing about whether to kill him or not. Finally, they told him (probably in a language he could understand), ‚ÄúEither you join our gang, or we'll kill you.‚Äù He grunted in reply so as not to commit himself. The others decided to wait for their chief (thus</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page450">Page 450</p>
<p class="PE"> the chief wasn't there): ‚ÄúWe'll decide after he comes.‚Äù Then just to make sure, they punched him a few more times in the belly and put the handkerchief over his nose ‚Äì out!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2348">Sometime later (he doesn't know how long, for until he returned he had no sense of time), he woke up in a rather dark, low-roofed house way out in the country; there were five persons now, not four. They were busy eating, so he was careful not to budge. Mainly they were drinking (they have prohibition there). Four of them were already dead drunk. So he got up to have a look. The fifth one, whom he hadn't seen before (he must have been the chief), was not yet totally drunk; when he saw the boy stirring, he let out a fearful growl ‚Äì so the poor boy threw himself flat in the corner and lay still ‚Äì he waited. After awhile, the fifth one (after downing another bottle) was also dead drunk. So now that he saw them all fast asleep, he got up very cautiously and... he said he ran for an hour and a half!... A boy pummelled as he had been, who hadn't eaten for four days! I think that's a miracle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2349">After running for an hour and a half, he found himself back at the Poona station, he doesn't know how. He caught a train back to Bombay, scarcely knowing how he managed it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2350">When I found this out, I immediately thought, ‚ÄúGood, this boy caught the formation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="214" href="#">2</a> X had made for the other one, and it got him back.‚Äù For it's really miraculous that he succeeded. But the other one, the nephew, was left stranded, nowhere to be found. It was obviously the same gang and the same method.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2351">Then the police got involved. They wanted to take him back to the countryside around Poona (naturally I suppose they nursed him in the meantime), but not much came out of it. Seems that wherever he remembered seeing these people, when he said he had seen them, he fainted. Finally, I was told the story, and the poor family wrote to me saying, ‚ÄúWho are these demons with such a great power that even it withstands Mother's force as well as that of X ‚Äì and who are holding our son?‚Äù So X was again informed and, knowing the story of the elder brother's friend, he said, ‚ÄúAh, now I know where the other one is, and I hope it won't take too long.‚Äù But then September 26 passed ‚Äì general despair in the family. They wrote to me, and I concentrated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2352">It was just before Durga Puja,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="215" href="#">3</a> or just after ‚Äì I can't remember</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page451">Page 451</p>
<p class="PE"> (dates and I don't go together) ‚Äì no, it was after Durga Puja. So I went into a deep concentration and, as a matter of fact, I saw that a very powerful and dangerous <em>rakshasic</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="216" href="#">4</a> power was involved. And then, when I started walking for my japa upstairs in my room (I had given some thought to this story and tried asking for something to be done), I suddenly saw Durga before me raising high a lance of white light ‚Äì the lance of light that destroys the hostile forces ‚Äì and She struck into a black swarming mass of men.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2353">But then there came a... frightful reaction. For one day I was nearly as sick ‚Äì not quite ‚Äì as two years ago<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="217" href="#">5</a> (they must have used the same mantra). And, you see, I who never vomit... terrible vomiting ‚Äì everything inside came out! Only now I'm a bit more experienced than two years ago (!), so I set it right... It happened here, downstairs, in the afternoon. I went right back up to my room (I didn't see anyone that afternoon), and I remained concentrated to try to find out what had happened. I saw that it came from there ‚Äì a backlash of those people trying to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2354">I did what had to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2355">But unfortunately, this spread all over the Ashram, all over everyone ‚Äì a black cloud everywhere. It was rather... troublesome!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2356">But some days later, a telephone call: the boy was found in Ahmedabad and brought back to Bombay.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2357">The boy's story is... fantastic! It's fantastic. He was thin, gray, empty-headed. I no longer recall all the details, but ultimately it was the same story: abducted from a railway station in the same way; he saw some people, an hypnotic state, and then no more recollection of what had happened to him, nothing at all. I don't know if they used a handkerchief on him as well, but he was ‚Äúhypnotized.‚Äù They punched him also when he asked to eat. And after that, no more appetite! As if they removed all interest in eating ‚Äì even when there was food, he didn't touch it. And absolutely empty-headed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2358">However, he recalls them repeatedly telling him this: ‚ÄúYou have no family; that name is not yours; you are called by such-and-such-a-name (they gave him another name); you are all alone and depend exclusively upon us.‚Äù But then, probably this boy had a slightly deeper consciousness, for although his brain did not seem</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page452">Page 452</p>
<p class="PE"> to be working outwardly, something deep down was able to observe and remember.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2359">Finally, they had him work as a waiter in a small caf√© in Ahmedabad, near the station. One day it even happened that his brother and his brother's friend stopped by (he vaguely recalls having seen them) but he was incapable of speaking to them or of getting them to recognize him. Another time, he tried to leave and headed towards the station, but after awhile he could no longer walk, he was suddenly stopped by something (he doesn't know what), and he had to go back. That's how it was ‚Äì quite a... unique state. But one day, a friend of the brother stopped at this caf√© to drink something, and this same boy served him. He had changed a lot, but the other fellow recognized him all the same and asked, ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù He saw that the boy seemed dazed and couldn't answer. So he didn't say anything but ran immediately to where the elder brother lived; they came back, took the boy into a corner and doused his face with seltzer water. It seems that then he started becoming more alive. Then they led him away and informed the police.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2360">I don't have any more details yet...</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>(Here we introduce, parenthetically, the details of the story as Mother told them two months later)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2361">I found out the details: this boy had to go to the station, but on his way, he went into a shoe store just next to the station to buy a pair of sandals. As he entered, he saw a man there choosing a pair of women's shoes for himself! This seemed strange to him: ‚ÄúWhat's this man doing buying...‚Äù and he <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WATCHED</span> ‚Äì suddenly, nothing more. He lost consciousness and no longer knew what happened to him. And that's how the story began ‚Äì a man selecting women's shoes in a shop! He must do strange things ‚Äì probably intentionally ‚Äì to attract people's attention. Naturally, out of curiosity, the boy started watching, and that was that ‚Äì all of a sudden, blank, nothing more! And long afterwards he found himself far away in a train with this man. He's here now with his mother ‚Äì they came to thank me. It's he who gave me the details. He's a nice boy, but all this has left him with some anxiety, especially when he speaks of it. He's trying to forget. He told me he'd like to join the army and asked my permission. The boy feels a need for force and he has the idea that to be part of such a force would be good for him. (Of course, he didn't tell me all this, he's</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page453">Page 453</p>
<p class="PE"> not that conscious. But that's what he feels ‚Äì the need to be supported by an organization of force.) So I encouraged him. I told him it was a good idea. His mother wasn't very happy! She feared he was leaping from the frying pan into the fire!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2362">Another curious detail is that after having taken away all his appetite and having put him in the caf√© as a waiter, they told him, ‚ÄúNow you must eat,‚Äù so he tried to eat, and for four days he vomited up everything he put in ‚Äì it was completely black! After that, he was able to start eating a little. It's a fantastic story!</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>(The conversation resumes here)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2363">But I was mainly interested by the fact that I felt the danger these people represented ‚Äì not because they were brigands, but because they had some power ‚Äì brigands with a power ‚Äì and from what I saw, it was not merely an hypnotic power. There must have been a tantric force in it, otherwise they would not have been so powerful, and especially so powerful from a distance. I had said to myself, ‚ÄúThey <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> be caught.‚Äù Which was why... (the Force kept on working, you see). And yesterday, the newspaper said that a gang of five men, eight women and half a dozen children had been arrested by the police in Allahabad for using what the newspaper called ‚Äúmesmeric‚Äù means to rob people, attack them, etc. (They were operating in Poona, Bombay and Ahmedabad, but they were caught in Allahabad). Probably when they realized that the boy was gone, they got frightened and fled to the North. And they were arrested in Allahabad ‚Äì I had made a very strong formation and had said, ‚ÄúThey <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUST</span> be caught.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2364">As of now, I have no other news... They've been caught, so they can't do any wrong <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OUTWARDLY</span>, but still their power is there.

I'm presently cleaning the whole place ‚Äì it's not easy. Everything is upside down.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2365">I had X informed. But I didn't tell him my difficulty (this mantra they threw on me to kill me), I didn't speak of that at all. For he had insisted, from the beginning he had said, ‚ÄúMother must see to it, only Mother's grace can save them.‚Äù And I understood ‚Äì their attack came just at the time of Durga Puja, so I understood that Durga had to intervene. So that's the story.</p>

It would come out [of the body], spread forth, move about. But that is the vital, it originates in the vital. It is a force from above, but what manifests is vital. Whereas now it is absolutely, clearly the golden supramental light in... an extraordinary pulsation, vibrant in intensity...

I don't mean to be severe or critical, but it's a world that likes to play to itself. It's not really what we could call histrionics, not that ‚Äì it's rather a need to dramatize to oneself. So it can be an heroic drama, it can be a musical drama, it can be a tragic drama, or quite simply a poetic drama ‚Äì and ninety-nine times out of a hundred, it's a romantic drama. And then, these ‚Äúsoul states‚Äù (!) come replete with certain spoken expressions... <span class="note_1"><em>(laughing)</em></span> I'm holding myself back from saying certain things! ‚Äì You know, it's like a theatricals store where you rent scenery and costumes.

For a particular occasion, they say, ‚ÄúYou're the woman of my life‚Äù (to be repeated as often as necessary), and for another they say... It's a whole world, a whole mode of human life which I suddenly felt I was holding in my arms. Yes, like a decoration, an ornament, a nicety ‚Äì an ornament of existence, to keep it from being flat and dull ‚Äì and the best means the human mind has found to get out of its <em>tamas</em>.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2441">So for persons who are severe and grave (there are two such examples here, but it's not necessary to name them)...

<p class="PE"> individuals. Naturally, if you remain there, you keep turning in circles; it will always be (not eternally, but indefinitely) ‚Äúthe woman of my life,‚Äù to take that as a symbol.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2442">The mistake we make is to remain there too long, for if you spend your whole life in that, well, you'll probably need many more lifetimes.

He must have spoken to you about this. He wants to write a kind of dialogue to introduce Sri Aurobindo's ideas ‚Äì it's a good idea ‚Äì like the conversations in <em>Les Hommes de Bonne Volont√©</em> by Jules Romain. He wants to do it, and I told him it was an excellent idea. And not only one type ‚Äì he should take all types of people who for the moment are closed to this vision of life, from the Catholic, the fervent believer, right to the utmost materialist, men of science, etc. It could be very interesting.</p>

<p class="PE"> It's an approach which is not at all mental nor intellectual nor (God knows!) moral in the least ‚Äì no notion of Good or Evil nor any of those things, absolutely none of that.

This experience with Z reminded me of a certain way of approaching Beauty that enables you even to find it in what appears dirty and ugly to the common vision. It is She trying to express herself in this something which to the common vision is ugly, dirty, hypocritical.

There was always this flame ‚Äì white, white, so white that nothing could make it other than white.

They're scattered along the way, sometimes repeated, sometimes only once, and then they vanish. And when you go through such an experience, you sense that they are things put aside for later on. And then, all of a sudden (especially during these last two years when I have again descended to take all that up), all of a sudden, one after another, all these snags return. And they don't follow the same curve; rather, it's as if suddenly you reach a certain state and a certain impersonal breadth that far surpasses the individual, and this new state enters into contact with one of those old ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù that had remained in the deepest part of the subconscient ‚Äì and that makes it rise up again, the two meet... in an explosion of light.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2458">This is entirely another way of understanding ‚Äì it's not an ascent, not even a descent nor an inspiration... it must be what Sri Aurobindo calls a ‚Äúrevelation.‚Äù It's the meeting of this subconscious notation ‚Äì this something which has remained buried within, held down so as not to manifest, but which suddenly surges forth to meet the light streaming down from above, this very vast state of consciousness that excludes nothing... and from it springs forth a light ‚Äì oh, a resplendence of light! ‚Äì like a new explanation of the world, or of that part of the world not yet explained.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2487">More small talk!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2488">Speaking of which, I looked at T's most recent questions on the <em>Aphorisms</em> again. All these children haven't the least sense of humor, so Sri Aurobindo's paradoxes throw them into a kind of despair!... The last aphorism went something like this: ‚ÄúWhen I could read a wearisome book from one end to the other with pleasure, then I knew I had conquered my mind.‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="232" href="#">2</a> So T asked me, ‚ÄúHow can you read a wearisome book with pleasure?‚Äù!!

It throws them into a terrible confusion!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2489">It's a lack of plasticity in the mind, and they are bound by the expression of things; for them, words are rigid. Sri Aurobindo explained it so well in <em>The Secret of the Veda</em>; he shows how language evolves and how, before, it was very supple and evocative. For example, one could at once think of a river and of</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page474">Page 474</p>
<p class="PE"> inspiration. Sri Aurobindo also gives the example of a sailboat and the forward march of life. And he says that for those of the Vedic age it was quite natural, the two could go together, superimposed; it was merely a way of looking at the same thing from two sides, whereas now, when a word is said, we think only of this word all by itself, and to get a clear picture we need a whole literary or poetic imagery (with explanations to boot!). That's exactly the case with these children; they're at a stage where everything is rigid. Such is the product of modern education. It even extracts the subtlest nuance between two words and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FIXES</span> it: ‚ÄúAnd above all, don't make any mistake, don't use this word for that word, for otherwise your writing's no good.‚Äù But it's just the opposite.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2492">Yes, everything is getting mildewed, everything you touch. I'm sleeping in a damp bed; to walk on the woolen carpets upstairs is like walking on moss ‚Äì in the forest! For myself, I don't mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2493">There's a certain sensibility which makes any increase in humidity felt. Before it starts raining, even several hours before, it feels like there are drops falling on my body. I can always say when it's going to rain. It's entirely physical, actually, merely a heightened sensitivity. It feels like very tiny drops (you know, like drizzle), the feeling of a very fine spray falling on the body. And yet the sky is clear; I say, ‚ÄúHmm, it's going to rain.‚Äù And it rains ‚Äì I felt it. I feel the water, and it never fails to come a few hours later.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2494">You asked me just now if we have a say in the matter. Well, last year I didn't go out; I had no intention of going to the 
Sports-ground or to the theatre for the December 2 program, but I was often asked to see that the weather be good. So while I was doing my japa upstairs, I started saying that it shouldn't rain. But ‚Äúthey‚Äù weren't in a very good mood! (When I used to go out myself, it had an effect, for it kept the thing in check, and even if it had been raining earlier, that day it would stop.) So they said, ‚ÄúBut you aren't going out, so what does it matter.‚Äù I said I was</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page475">Page 475</p>
<p class="PE"> counting on it. Then they answered, ‚ÄúAre you prepared to have it rain the next time you go out?‚Äù ‚Äì ‚ÄúDo what you like,‚Äù I replied. And when I went out on November 24 for the prize distribution, there was a deluge. It came pouring down and we had to run for shelter in the gymnasium ‚Äì everyone was splashing around, the band playing on the verandah was half-drenched, it was dreadful! ‚Äì the day before it hadn't rained, the day after it didn't rain. But on that day they had their revenge!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2495">I don't want that to happen this time. Once is enough. So I'm going to see about it.</p>
<p class="Q"><em>(silence)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2496">But it's explained very well in <em>Savitri</em>! All these things have their laws and their conventions (and truly speaking, a really <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FORMIDABLE</span> power is needed to change anything of their rights, for they have rights ‚Äì what they call ‚Äúlaws‚Äù)... Sri Aurobindo explains this very well when Savitri, following Satyavan into death, argues with the god of Death.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="233" href="#">3</a> ‚ÄúIt's the Law, and who has the right to change the Law?‚Äù he says. And then comes this wonderful passage at the end where she replies, ‚ÄúMy God can change it. And my God is a God of Love.‚Äù Oh, how magnificent!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2497">And by force of repeating this to him, he yields... She replies in this way to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVERYTHING</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2498">It's all right for winning a Victory, but not for stopping the rain for one day!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2499">So I'm trying to come to an understanding, to reach an agreement ‚Äì these are very complicated matters (!). For it's a whole totality... You see, we are trying something here which really is contrary to all those laws and practices, something which disturbs everything. So ‚Äúthey‚Äù propose things that have me advancing like this <span class="note_1"><em>(sinuous motion)</em></span>, 
without disturbing things too much, and without having to call in forces... <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother makes a gesture of a lance thrust into the pack)</em></span> forces a bit too great, which may disturb things too much. Like that, we can keep tacking back and forth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2500">A while ago... You know that I have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TREMENDOUS</span> financial difficulties. In fact, I have handed the whole matter over to the Lord, telling Him, ‚ÄúIt's your affair; if you want us to continue this experience, well, you must provide the means.‚Äù But this upsets some of ‚Äúthem,‚Äù so they come along with all kinds of suggestions to keep</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page476">Page 476</p>
<p class="PE"> me from having to... to resort to something so drastic. They suggest all kinds of things; some time ago they said, ‚ÄúWhat about a good cyclone, or a good earthquake? A lot of damage to the Ashram, a public appeal ‚Äì that would bring in some funds!‚Äù <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother laughs)</em></span> Yes, it's of this order! And it's all quite clear and definite ‚Äì we have veritable ‚Äúconversations‚Äù!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2501">I listen, I answer. ‚ÄúIt's not satisfactory!‚Äù I told them. But they've kept to their idea, they like it. When that first storm came some time back (you remember, with those terrible bolts of lightning and that asuric being P.K. saw and sketched): ‚ÄúDon't you want us to destroy something?...‚Äù I got angry. But it was... This influence was so close and acute that it gave you goose bumps! The whole time the storm lasted, I had to hold on tight in my bed, like this <span class="note_1">
<em>(Mother closes her fists tight as in a trance or deep concentration)</em></span>, and I didn't move ‚Äì didn't move ‚Äì like a... a rock during the entire storm, until he consented to go a bit further away. Then I moved. And even now, it comes ‚Äì from others (there's not just one, you see, there are many): ‚ÄúHow about a good flood?‚Äù A roof collapsed the other day with someone underneath, but he was able to escape. So roofs are collapsing, houses... ‚ÄúArouse public sympathy, we must help the Ashram!‚Äù ‚ÄúIt's no good,‚Äù I said. But maybe that's what's responsible for this interminable rain. And they offer so many other things... oh, what they parade past me! You could write books on all this!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2502">But generally ‚Äì and this is something Th√©on had told me (Th√©on was very qualified on the subject of hostile forces and the workings of all that ‚Äúresists‚Äù the divine influence, and he was a great fighter ‚Äì as you might imagine! He himself was an incarnation of an asura, so he knew how to tackle these things!); he was always saying, ‚ÄúIf you make a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY SMALL</span> concession or suffer a minor defeat, it gives you the right to a very great victory.‚Äù It's a very good trick. And I have observed, in practice, that for all things, even for the very little things of everyday life, it's true ‚Äì if you yield on one point (if, even though you see what should be, you yield on a very secondary and unimportant point), it immediately gives you the power to impose your will for something much more important. I mentioned this to Sri Aurobindo and he said that it was true. It is true in the world as it is today, but it's not what we want; we want it to change, really change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2503">He wrote this in a letter, I believe, and he spoke of this system of compensation ‚Äì for example, those who take an illness on themselves in order to have the power to cure; and then there's</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page477">Page 477</p>
<p class="PE"> the symbolic story of Christ dying on the cross to set men free. And Sri Aurobindo said, ‚ÄúThat's fine for a certain age, but we must now go beyond that.‚Äù As he told me (it's even one of the first things he told me), ‚ÄúWe are no longer at the time of Christ when, to be victorious, it was necessary to die.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2508"><em>What can make them yield?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2509">Divine Love.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2510">It's the only thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2511">Sri Aurobindo has explained it in <em>Savitri</em>. Only when Divine Love has manifested in all its purity will everything yield, will it all yield ‚Äì it will then be done.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2515">Sri Aurobindo had also written to the effect, ‚ÄúIf Divine Love were to manifest now in all its fullness and totality, not a single material organism would but burst.‚Äù So we must learn to widen, widen, widen not only the inner consciousness (that is relatively easy ‚Äì at least feasible), but even this conglomeration of cells. And I've experienced this: you have to be able to widen this sort of crystallization if you want to be able to hold this Force. I know. Two or three times, upstairs 
[in Mother's room], I felt the body about to burst. Actually, I was on the verge of saying, ‚Äúburst and be done with.‚Äù But Sri Aurobindo always intervened ‚Äì all three times he intervened in an entirely tangible, living and concrete way... and he arranged everything so that I was forced to wait.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2516">Then weeks go by, sometimes even months, between one thing and another, so that some elasticity may come into these stupid cells.</p>

<p class="PE"> So much time is wasted. We are... oh! We are so hard! <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother hits her body)</em></span> As hard as a rock.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2517">But three times now, I've really felt that I was on the verge of... falling apart. The first time it brought a fever, a fever so... I don't know, as if I had at least 115¬∞! ‚Äì I was roasting from head to toe; everything became red hot, and then... it was over. That was the day when suddenly ‚Äì suddenly ‚Äì I was... You see, I had said to myself, ‚ÄúAll right, you must be peaceful, let's see what happens,‚Äù so then I brought down the Peace, and immediately I was able to pass into a 'second of unconsciousness ‚Äì and I woke up in the subtle physical, in Sri Aurobindo's abode.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="234" href="#">4</a> There he was. And then I spent some time with him, explaining the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2518">But that was really an experience, a decisive experience (it was many months ago, perhaps more than a year ago).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2519">So I explained the problem to Sri Aurobindo, and he replied (by his expression, not with words, but it was clear), ‚ÄúPatience, patience ‚Äì patience, it will come.‚Äù And a few days after this experience, ‚Äúby chance‚Äù I came upon something he had written where precisely he explained that we are much too rigid, coagulated, clenched for these things to be able to manifest ‚Äì we must widen, relax, become plastic.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2534">While it was all coming up, I thought, ‚ÄúHow is this possible?...‚Äù For during those years of my life (I'm now outside things; I do them but I'm entirely outside, so they don't involve me ‚Äì whether it's like this or like that makes no difference to me; I'm only doing my work, that's all), I was already conscious, but nevertheless I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> what I was doing to a certain extent; I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> this web of social life (but thank God it wasn't here in India, for had it been here I could not have withstood it!

<p class="PE"> 
it's even worse than over there). You see, there it's... it's a bit less 
constricting, a bit looser, you can slip through the mesh from time to time to 
breathe some air. But here, according to what I've learned from people and what 
Sri Aurobindo told me, it's absolutely unbearable (it's the same in Japan, 
absolutely unbearable). In other words, you can't help but smash everything. 
Over there, you sometimes get a breath of air, but still it's quite relative. 
And this morning I wondered... (you see, for years I lived in that way... for 
years and years) just as I was wondering, ‚ÄúHow was I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ABLE</span> to live that and not kick out in every direction?‚Äù, just as I was looking at it, I saw up above, above this...

It is dull, dull, dull... gray, gray, gray, clenched tight, a closed web that lets through neither air nor life nor light ‚Äì there is nothing) and just then I saw a splendor of such sweet light above it ‚Äì so sweet, so full of true love, true compassion, something so warm, so warm... the relief, the solace of an eternity of sweetness, light, beauty, in an eternity of patience which feels neither the past nor the inanity and imbecility of things ‚Äì it was so wonderful! That was entirely the feeling it gave, and I said to myself, ‚Äú<span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is what made you live, without <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> it would not have been possible.‚Äù Oh, it would not have been possible ‚Äì I would not have lived even three days! <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is there, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS</span> there, awaiting its hour, if we would only let it in.</p>

<p class="p-num" id="page482">Page 482</p>
<p class="PE"> I thought, ‚Äúhere's a chunk of life sent back to me for clarifying. I must work on it.‚Äù But it didn't stop there... It's strange how all this past had been swept clean ‚Äì I could no longer remember dates, I couldn't even remember when Z had been here before, I no longer knew what had happened, it had all been wiped clean ‚Äì which means that it had all been pushed down into the subconscient. I didn't even know how I used to speak to him when I saw him, nothing, it was all gone. All that had remained alive were one or two movements or facts which were clearly connected to the psychic life, the psychic consciousness ‚Äì but just one or two or three such memories; all the rest was gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2540">So a whole slice of my life came back, but it didn't stop there! It keeps extending back further and further, and memories keep on coming, things that go back sixty years now, even beyond, seventy, seventy-five years ‚Äì they are all coming back. And so it all has to be put in order.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2541">It's quite odd, for this was not a personal consciousness, it was not ‚Äúsomeone remembering his life‚Äù ‚Äì this is what I found most interesting; what came were pieces, little chunks of life's construction, a collection of people and circumstances. And it is impossible to separate the individual from all that is around him, it's clear! It all holds together like... (if you change one thing, everything is changed) it holds together like an agglomerated mass.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2542">I had seen this earlier from another angle. In the beginning, when I started having the consciousness of immortality and when I brought together this true consciousness of immortality and the human conception of it (which is entirely different), I saw so clearly that when a human (even quite an ordinary human, one who is not a collectivity in himself ‚Äì as is a writer, for example, or a philosopher or statesman) projects himself through his imagination into what he calls ‚Äúimmortality‚Äù (meaning an indefinite duration of time) he doesn't project himself alone but rather, inevitably and always, what is projected along with himself is a whole agglomeration, a collectivity or totality of things which represent the life and the consciousness of his present existence. And then I made the following experiment on a number of people; I said to them, ‚ÄúExcuse me, but let's say that through a special discipline or a special grace your life were to continue indefinitely. What you would most likely extend into this indefinite future are the circumstances of your life, this formation you have built around yourself that is made up of people, relationships, activities, a whole collection of more or less living or inert things.</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page483">Page 483</p>
<p class="PE"> But that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> be extended as it is, for everything is constantly changing! And to be immortal, you have to follow this perpetual change; otherwise, what will naturally happen is what now happens ‚Äì one day you will die because you can no longer follow the change. But if you can follow it, then all this will fall from you! Understand that what will survive in you is something you don't know very well, but it's the only thing that can survive ‚Äì and all the rest will keep falling off all the time... Do you still want to be immortal?‚Äù ‚Äì Not one in ten said yes!... Once you are able to make them feel the thing concretely, they tell you, ‚ÄúOh no! Oh no! Since everything else is changing, the body might as well change too! What difference would it make!‚Äù But what remains is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>; <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is what you must truly hold on to ‚Äì but then you must <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BE THAT</span>, not this whole agglomeration. What you now call ‚Äúyou‚Äù is not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>, it's a whole collection of things..</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2543">Formerly, that was my first step ‚Äì a long time ago. Now it's so very different... I wonder how it was possible to have been so totally blind as to call that ‚Äúoneself‚Äù at any moment in one's life! It's a collection of things. And what was the link by which that could be called ‚Äúoneself‚Äù? That's more difficult to find out. Only when you climb above do you come to realize that <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is at work here, but it could work there as well, or as well here, or here, or here... At times there is suddenly a drop of something (Oh, I saw that this morning ‚Äì it was like a drop, a little drop, but with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SUCH</span> an intense and perfect light...), and where <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> falls it makes its center and begins radiating out and acting. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is what can be called ‚Äúoneself‚Äù ‚Äì nothing else. And <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> precisely is what enabled me to live in such dreadfully uninteresting, such nonexistent circumstances. And at the moment when you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ARE</span> that, you see how that has lived and how that has used everything, not only in this body but in all bodies and through all time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2544">At the core, this is the experience; it is no longer knowledge. I now understand quite clearly the difference between the knowledge of the eternal soul, of life eternal through all its changes, and this <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONCRETE</span> experience of the thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2545">It's very moving.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2546">It was strange, this morning... I came a few minutes late. (I blamed the clocks which weren't working, but it wasn't the clocks which were to blame!) I was getting dressed when suddenly all this came upon me ‚Äì I had a moment of... it may have lasted one or two minutes, just a few minutes, not long. ‚Äì Oh, the emotion I had during the experience was... it was very absorbing.</p>

<p class="PE"> It was no longer this (that is, life as it is on earth) becoming conscious of That (the eternal soul, this ‚Äúportion of the Supreme‚Äù as Sri Aurobindo said); it was the eternal soul seeing life... in its own way ‚Äì but without separation, without any separation, not like something looking from above that feels itself to be different... How strange it is! It's not something else, it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> something else, it's not even a distortion, not even... It's losing its illusory quality as described in the old spiritualities ‚Äì that's not what it is! In my experience, there was... there was clearly an... emotion ‚Äì I can't describe it, there are no words. It wasn't a feeling, it was something like an emotion, a vibration... of such <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TOTAL</span> closeness and at the same time of compassion, a compassion of love. (Oh, words are so pitiful!...) One was this outer thing, which was the total negation of the other and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT THE SAME TIME</span> the other, without the least separation between them. It <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> the other. So what was born in one was born in the other as well, in this eternal light. A sweetness of identity, precisely, an identity that was necessarily such total understanding with such perfect love ‚Äì but ‚Äúlove‚Äù says it poorly, all words are poor! It's not that; it's something else! It's something that cannot be expressed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2547">I lived that this morning, upstairs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2548">And this body is... oh, how feeble and how poor it is. All it finds to express itself are the tears that come to its eyes! Why? ‚Äì I don't know.</p>

Finally, I had a pulled ligament which for three or four years now has periodically given me pain (a thigh ligament where it joins the pelvis, to be precise), and this last week it was hurting so much that I found it difficult to sit cross-legged for meditation.

<p class="Q"><em>(Mother remains silent a moment, then says:)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2554">Not last night but the night before, I touched at least one of the causes (at that time it felt like <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> cause) of a certain powerlessness to act directly on Matter... You see, when the Will and the Power come, they are extremely effective everywhere <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UP TO A CERTAIN REGION</span> (in other words, whether people are receptive or not, open or not, makes no difference ‚Äì when the Will is applied it is all-powerful <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UP TO</span> a certain region) but once it arrives here, at the most material material, its efficacy depends on many things ‚Äì and a power which depends on something is no power! For a long, long time I have been searching for the reasons behind this powerlessness. I've located a few, one after another, and upon these points there was an immediate effect. But some things resisted (oh, quite a number, in a number of ways); for example, it had difficulty acting on illnesses, on the cells, on doubt (not mental doubt, but rather the doubt of the physical consciousness which can't accept certain things that seem impossible to it</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page486">Page 486</p>
<p class="PE"> ‚Äì what Sri Aurobindo calls disbelief,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="236" href="#">1</a> not a mental doubt, but the <em>disbelief</em> of the physical consciousness which can't accept what is contrary to its own nature and its own working). And as for illnesses, sometimes it has an immediate effect, but sometimes it drags on and has to follow its so-called normal course. On all these three points, I clearly felt that something was hampering it. These are the Enemy's strongholds; all that doesn't want the Divine seizes upon it and even the working of the Power coming from above is obstructed, for when it must work here in the body, it is stopped or deformed or altered or diminished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2555">All this goes on in the subconscient; these are things that were pushed out of the physical consciousness down into the subconscient, so they're there and they come back up whenever they please.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2638">There's the religious attitude, and then there's ordinary life where people do things ‚Äì working, living, eating, enjoying life; they regard these as the essentials, and as for the rest, well, when there's time they think about it.

I remember at Tlemcen, Th√©on used to say that there was a whole world of things, such as eating, for example, or taking care of your body, that should be done automatically, without giving it any importance ‚Äì ‚Äúit's not the time to think of things divine.‚Äù(!) That's what he preached. So you have the religious attitude of all the religious types, and then ordinary life ‚Äì I found both of them equally unsatisfactory.

Yet in spite of this, one thing after another comes, like this, like that <span class="note_1"><em>(Mother draws little arrows in the air)</em></span>: what I must do, what I must answer to this person, what I must say to that one, what has to be done...

Then slowly, slowly, I felt this type of smiling and serene peace that I live in entering into the body. The cells are still not always conscious of it (sometimes they feel a sort of... tension of life ‚Äì I don't know what to call it). They're conscious of their existence and of what it means and of the Energy that is acting (yes, conscious of the Action and the Energy that acts), but during the meditation <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> descended and there was an extraordinary relaxation. Not the relaxation that comes with <em>surrender</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="246" href="#">1</a> which I normally feel before sleeping, but the relaxation that comes from a kind of serene, immutable and eternal joy. At that moment the body felt it could remain like that forever! ‚ÄúOh, how nice I feel!...‚Äù it said.

Really, it's so interesting; I have visions... you see, the thing in its truth is so simple it's stupefying, and then here it becomes so complicated, painful, exhausting, upsetting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2679">But it's enough to take one step behind to come out of it all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2680">I'll tell you about that... Wait, we still have three minutes; I want to tell you one of my most recent visions (but it's almost the same thing every night):</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2681">I was in my home, somewhere ‚Äì a world whose light is like a sun (golden with scarlet reflections); it was very beautiful. It was in a town, and my house was in that town. I wanted to take to someone some... not presents, but things he needed. So I got everything together, prepared it all, and then loaded my arms with all the packages (I had taken my own time to arrange everything nicely), and I went out when the whole town was completely deserted ‚Äì there was not a soul on the streets. A complete solitude. And such a sense of well-being, of light and force! Yes, really a kind of felicity, for no reason. And instead of weighing me down, it seemed as if my packages were pulling me! They pulled me on in such a way that each step was a joy, like a dance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2682">This lasted the whole time I was crossing the town. Then I came to a border, right at the beginning of another part where I was to take my packages; there, just a little below me, I saw a house under construction ‚Äì the house belonging to the person to whom I had to deliver these presents (the symbolism in all this, of course, is quite clear).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2683">As I approached the house, but still from some distance, I suddenly saw some men busy at work. Then instantly... instantly this road which was so vast, sunlit and smooth ‚Äì so smooth to the feet... oh, it became the top level of a scaffolding. And what is more, this scaffolding was not very well made, and the closer I</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page505">Page 505</p>
<p class="PE"> came the more complicated it got ‚Äì there were planks jutting out, beams off balance. In short, you had to watch every single step to keep from breaking your neck. I began getting annoyed. Moreover, my packages were heavy. They were heavy and they so saddled my arms that I was unable to hold onto anything and had constantly to do a balancing act. Then I began thinking, ‚ÄúMy God, how complicated this world is!‚Äù And just at that moment, I saw a young person coming along, like a young girl dressed in European clothes, with a hat on her head... all black! This young person had white skin, but her clothes were black, and she wore black shoes on her small white feet. She was dressed all in black ‚Äì black, all in black. Like complete unconsciousness. She also came carrying packages (many more than me), and she came hopping along the whole length of the scaffolding, putting her feet just anywhere! ‚ÄúMy God,‚Äù I said to myself, ‚Äúshe's going to break her neck!‚Äù ‚Äì But not at all! She was totally unconscious; she wasn't even aware that it was dangerous or complicated ‚Äì a total unconsciousness. But her unconsciousness is what allowed her to go on like that! I watched it all. ‚ÄúWell, sometimes it's good to be unconscious!‚Äù Then she disappeared; she had only come to give me a demonstration (she neither saw me nor looked at me). And looking down at the workers, I saw that everything was getting more and more complicated, more and more, more and more ‚Äì and there wasn't even any ladder by which to get down. In other words, it was getting unbearable. Then something in me rebelled: ‚ÄúAh, no! I've had enough of all this ‚Äì it's too stupid!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2684">And <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IMMEDIATELY</span>, I found myself down below, relieved of my packages. And everything was perfectly simple. (I had even brought the packages along without realizing it.) All, all was in order, very neat, very luminous, very simple ‚Äì simply because I had said, ‚ÄúAh, no! I've had enough of this business! Why all these stupid complications!‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="251" href="#">5</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2685">But these are not ‚Äúdreams,‚Äù they are types of activity ‚Äì more real, more concrete than material life; the experience is much more concrete than ordinary life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2686">I have had hundreds of such examples... It's not always the same scene. The scenes are different, but the story is always the same ‚Äì the thing, in its truth, is absolutely luminous, pleasant, charming; then as soon as men get involved, it becomes an</p>
<p class="p-num" id="page506">Page 506</p>
<p class="PE"> abominable complication. And once you say, ‚ÄúNo! I've had enough of all this ‚Äì it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT TRUE</span>!‚Äù it goes away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2687">There have been similar stories in ‚Äúdreams‚Äù with X. I saw him when he was very young (his education, the ideas he had, how he was trained). And the same thing happened. I was with him... but I'll tell you that another time...<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="252" href="#">6</a> ¬†And then at the end, I'd had enough and I said, ‚ÄúOh, no! It's too ridiculous!‚Äù and with that I left the house. At the door was a little squirrel sitting on his haunches making friendly little gestures towards me. ‚ÄúOh!‚Äù I said, ‚Äúhere's someone who understands better!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_5-2688">But later I observed, I saw that this had helped drain him of all the weight of his past education. Very interesting... Night after night, night after night, night after night ‚Äì plenty of things! You could write novels about it all.</p>
