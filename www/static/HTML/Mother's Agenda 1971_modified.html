<h2>Mother’s Agenda</h2>
<h3>1971</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document  —  6,000 pages in 13 volumes  —  is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death  —  upon the very power that changes death  —  and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>This fragment was noted from memory by a disciple following the long physical ordeal Mother went through for nearly a month and a half.</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Physical vision requires a much more continuous concentration. The physical vision serves to stabilize. It gives continuity to things. The same with hearing. So when neither of them are there, you become conscious of the thing directly, which gives you the true knowledge of it. That is probably how the Supermind will work.</p>
<p class="P">My physical vision and hearing have been pushed into the background to be replaced by identity through consciousness – for the growth of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">The way of relating to things, of knowing, is through an identification of the consciousness with the thing or person. Instead of having the usual sense of separateness, you have a constant sense of union. There are quite interesting experiences. People call me and think about me. That comes into my field of consciousness. And after some time I am told, "So and so has come," or "Something has happened to so and so," and I say, "I know." I wasn't told anything at the time it happened, but I was conscious of it as if it were happening to a part of me.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Satprem has not seen Mother since last December 2. The latest turning point in her yoga has just occurred, similar to those of 1962 and 1968. Her small voice quivers and is lost in a murmur, yet her laugh is fresh as a young girl's.</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I am happy to see you!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 19</p>
<p class="P"><em>Good morning, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">Are you feeling better?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. It's been a long time since I've seen you....</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.... One of my legs went dead for a long time – it's just starting to come back to life – it was paralyzed. This leg (<em>the left</em>). So naturally everything was difficult.... I had an intestinal ulcer, but that didn't last long. It was more serious but it didn't last. An intestinal ulcer. But what ties me down is this leg that became paralyzed. (<em>Mother touches her left leg.</em>) The lower part of it, from the knee to the heel. So naturally you become an imbecile!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh!</em></p>
<p class="P">You are completely helpless.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But then it means a lot of work is being done, doesn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P">What was remarkable (I want to tell you this right away) is that the consciousness established there (<em>gesture above her head</em>) has grown stronger and stronger and clearer and clearer. And it's CONSTANT. I worked – I went on working – not only for India but for the world, and in touch ("consulted," you understand), actively.</p>
<p class="P">As for the transformation, I don't know.... What I had explained about the "replacement of the consciousness" (<em>the transfer</em>) went on methodically, methodically, absolutely methodically and continuously, but with... some apparent impairment, or at least the capacities of my body were greatly diminished for a certain time. But there is a curious phenomenon concerning sight and hearing: from time to time they're clear, as clear as can be, and at other times they're completely blurred. And it has very, very clearly another origin – another origin of influence. But I think it will take months before I can understand it. In any case, the general consciousness (<em>gesture above her head</em>), what could be called the universal consciousness (or at least terrestrial), hasn't budged for one minute – not one single minute. It has stayed there all the time. Only, you're a complete imbecile; you know how it is when you can't do anything: you're helpless, you can't even go from your chair to the bed, you can't do anything – one leg isn't there.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 20</p>
<p class="P"> Even now I can't walk unaided, I need someone to hold me up.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But it will come back, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">It is coming back. It is coming back little by little. There was a time when it was total: it was cold as ice. There was no circulation. Something had blocked the circulation. Now it's better, it's coming back to life.</p>
<p class="P">Only, I thought of the <em>Bulletin</em>, we can't leave the <em>Bulletin</em> like that. Did you prepare it?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, it's all ready, Mother. I've already given it to the Press.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, what did you give?</p>
<p class="P">Here....</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother gives some packages of soup</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Thank you, Mother.... First, "The Synthesis of Yoga" (the chapter on "The Liberation of the Spirit"), then "Conversations with Pavitra," then "Thoughts and Aphorisms" commented on by you, and then "Mother Answers," and finally two old Talks of 1953 in the Playground.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, that's... [old].</p>
<p class="P"><em>But they're very interesting.</em></p>
<p class="P">Concerning what?</p>
<p class="P"><em>For example, someone asks you why you don't have disciples of higher quality to do the work here.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother laughs whole-heartedly, her laugh is so refreshing!</em>)</p>
<p class="P">He's a severe critic!</p>
<p class="P"><em>So you answer that if you had very "realized" people, they would probably be more resistant to your influence.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother nods her head</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Did you see what Z noted down [note of January 11, 1971]?</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 21</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, I've seen it.</em></p>
<p class="P">What did you think of it?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I thought it probably would have to be like that: it's the beginning of a new functioning.</em></p>
<p class="P">It's a new functioning. It's interesting. In fact I was thinking that perhaps I could explain it to you if you ask me a question or two. And then, maybe it could be used [for the <em>Bulletin</em>], so there's not an abrupt break in the continuity.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Is it your perception of people and circumstances that has changed? Your way of perceiving things?</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, completely – completely. It's very strange....</p>
<p class="P">Basically, all that time was used to develop the consciousness of the physical being. It really seems as if this physical being (<em>Mother touches her body</em>) had been prepared for another consciousness, because for certain things... its reactions are entirely different, its attitude is different. I went through a period of total indifference in which the world represented... meant nothing. And then little by little a kind of new perception grew out of it.</p>
<p class="P">I am only in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="P">But I was thinking that for the <em>Bulletin</em> perhaps we could put a note that would connect the different periods, because going abruptly, without any bridge from what was to what will be – what I feel will be – would be very difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="P">How did you feel about that note?... I am all the more interested because I didn't have any contact with anyone at that point: Z happened to be cleaning the room while the others were busy – they were my legs to do things! It was quite a physical task, you know: to get me from a chair to an armchair and from the armchair to the bed.... It was really bad, I was like a child – worse, worse because the rest of the body, all the rest of the body was normal, but for some time one of my legs was simply... it was as if it were finished, as if there were nothing there. And little by little, little by little it came back. That was the final period. But it was not an innocent paralysis! For at least three weeks – at least – for three weeks there was a continuous pain, night and day, 24 hours out of 24, without any letup, none whatsoever: it was as if everything were being torn out of me.... You know, I don't usually</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="P"> complain, but I was almost forced to cry out loud all the time. So, of course, there was no question of seeing anyone. Now it's over. The pain is quite bearable and the body has resumed a somewhat normal existence.</p>
<p class="P">But I wanted to tell you that my consciousness was actively with you all the time; I thought: if he feels it, so much the better; if he doesn't... it doesn't matter.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P"><em>I felt the Power very intensely.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, then that's it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, quite instantaneously, quite immediately.</em></p>
<p class="P">Then it's all right.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Above all, I thought that if it had gone down into your legs, that meant it had now completely gone down into matter.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, exactly! But I took it that way too. Not only was it the leg, but the lower part of the leg (<em>Mother points to her feet</em>). This one (<em>Mother touches her right leg</em>) was on the verge of being paralyzed also, but the day it happened, I concentrated with a vengeance, I walked for a long, long time to keep it from being paralyzed. I managed to keep it from being paralyzed; only this one (<em>left one</em>) was stricken.</p>
<p class="P">But the whole body has changed drastically. For example, with respect to food, I have absolutely no appetite – none whatsoever. For a time, I even felt disgusted, a kind of disgust for food – it was very difficult because they wanted to force me to eat just the same.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="2" href="#">2</a> To me eating seemed like something... miserable, you know, without any meaning, exactly as if I had never eaten in my life. Out of sheer effort I managed to go on taking what is considered indispensable (<em>laughing</em>) to keep the body alive!</p>
<p class="P">It nearly became serious when an ulcer erupted in the intestines. An ulcer erupted, and then naturally there was no question of eating.... But I have noticed how those things, the so-called</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="P"> catastrophes or calamities or mishaps or difficulties or... how they all come JUST at the right moment to help you – JUST when it's needed to help you.... You see, everything in the physical nature that still belonged to the old world and its habit and ways of doing and being and acting, all that couldn't be (<em>handled</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="3" href="#">3</a> is the word), it couldn't be handled in any other way than this: by illness.</p>
<p class="P">The doctors were quite concerned about the intestinal ulcer. If it had perforated, it would have been very, very serious – the ordinary recourse is an operation, so.... The doctors were quite concerned. But they didn't show anything, I didn't know about it – I found out about the ulcer only when it was healed (I mean when it was in the process of healing).</p>
<p class="P">It certainly was interesting.</p>
<p class="P">But personally, even physically I kept a contact with everyone – I don't know who remained conscious of it, but I kept a contact with everyone, especially with you; with you I had the feeling that nothing stopped, that I was seeing you regularly, that nothing stopped. And I saw Sujata too. It all depends on people's receptivity. I didn't have the slightest feeling there was a break in our relationship or anything of that kind – not the slightest. And it's only... well, it's only the day before yesterday that I thought, "Oh, it must be time for the <em>Bulletin</em>, perhaps I should find out what he's done...." And then there was that note of Z's... (what shall I say?) it came as the result of something, and it was also the beginning of something, in a most definite manner. I didn't know, and Z was there at the time cleaning the room, so I told her, and after telling her, I thought perhaps it could be used.</p>
<p class="P">I don't know how she noted it down, whether it makes sense....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, it makes sense.</em></p>
<p class="P">You found it comprehensible?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes. You were saying that the whole functioning of sight and hearing had probably been suppressed so that you may be conscious of things directly, without using the sense organs.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but that note is already ancient history, because I have started to see again, but in another way. I have started to see and hear again.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="P"><em>In essence, you see and hear according to what is necessary.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, yes, exactly, that's quite true! It's quite true. I hear what's necessary for me to hear, even if it's a very faint sound, but all the sounds of conversation, all the things that make a lot of noise, I don't hear at all!... Something is changed. Only it's old – it's old, I mean, it has an old habit pattern. Although fortunately I was never a creature of habit.... Yes (<em>smiling</em>), you could say: it's as if something quite tough was in the process of changing! So it lacks suppleness, ease. But the change is there – the change is definite. I have changed VERY MUCH, even in character, in comprehension, in the vision of things – very, very much. There's been a whole rearrangement.</p>
<p class="P">But, I didn't know whether that note could be used in a way for people to understand.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, it's possible by adding what you've just said today.</em></p>

And for the last two or three days, it seems to be recovering.... You know, it was such a... it was the whole problem of the world – a world that was nothing but pain and suffering, and a great question mark: why?</p>
<p class="P">I tried every possible remedy: changing pain into pleasure, suppressing the capacity to feel, thinking about something else.... I tried all the "tricks" – not a single one worked. There is something in the physical world as it is which is not... (how can I put it?) which still is not open to the Divine Vibration. And that "something" is what causes absolutely all the trouble.... The Divine Consciousness is not perceived. And so there are lots of imaginary things (but very real to the sensation) that exist, while that, the only thing that's true, is not perceived. But it's better now. It's better.</p>

I think something has been achieved from a general standpoint (<em>Mother makes a grinding gesture</em>); it wasn't just the difficulty of one body or one person: I think something was achieved in terms of preparing Matter to receive in the right way, correctly – it's as if it had been received incorrectly before, and it has learned to receive in the true way.</p>
<p class="P">It will come. I don't know whether it will take months or years for the thing to become... clear. Then it can be cured.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="P">"I don't believe in advertisement except for books etc., and in propaganda except for politics and patent medicines. But for serious work it is a poison. It means either a stunt or a boom – and stunts and booms exhaust the thing they carry on their chest and leave it lifeless and broken high and dry on the shores of nowhere – or it means a movement. A movement in the case of a work like mine means the founding of a school or a sect or some other damned nonsense. It means that hundreds or thousands of useless people join in and corrupt the work or reduce it to a pompous farce from which the Truth that was coming down recedes into secrecy or silence. It is what has happened to the 'religions' and is the reason of their failure."</p>

<p class="Ps">A Most Fruitful Adventure</p>
<p class="P">"As there is a category of facts to which our senses are our best available but very imperfect guides, as there is a category of truths which we seek by the keen but still imperfect light of our reason, so according to the mystic, there is a category of more subtle truths which surpass the reach both of the senses and the reason but can be ascertained by an inner direct knowledge and direct experience. These truths are supersensuous, but not the less real for that: they have immense results upon the consciousness changing its substance and movement, bringing especially deep peace and abiding joy, a great light of vision and knowledge, a possibility of the overcoming of the lower animal nature, vistas of a spiritual self-development which without them do not exist. A new outlook on things arises which brings with it, if fully pursued into its consequences, a great liberation, inner harmony, unification – many other possibilities besides. These things have been experienced, it is true, by a small minority of the human race, but still there has been a host of independent witnesses to them in all times, climes and conditions and numbered among them are some of the greatest intelligences of the past, some of the world's most remarkable figures.

<p class="P"><em>There's a question of C.S. [a German translator]. Because there are differences between C.S. and T.K. [another translator] over the vocabulary to use. Three or four years ago already, when C.S. translated my first book, there was a whole discussion and you made certain suggestions. You said in particular that the word "mental" [mind] and the word "esprit" [spirit] should not be translated by the same word.</em></p>
<p class="P">Of course not!</p>
<p class="P"><em>So various words were suggested for</em> "mental" <em>and</em> "esprit," <em>and finally we had chosen two words: the word</em> "Geist" <em>for</em> "mental" <em>(if I remember correctly) and the word</em> "Spirit" <em>for</em> "esprit," <em>although</em> "Spirit" <em>isn't German. And now C.S. wants to impose the same terms on all the German translators and on T.K. in particular – but the other translators don't agree.</em></p>
<p class="P">How does T.K. translate <em>"esprit"</em>?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I don't know.</em></p>
<p class="P">Obviously <em>"Spirit"</em> isn't so good, but isn't there a word in German for <em>"Esprit"</em>?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I believe they use the same word for</em> "mental": "Geist" <em>and</em> "Geist."</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 68</p>
<p class="P">How awful!</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">We should find out what T.K. is using, because.... Using the same word is out of the question.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But T.K. may not use the same word because she has a totally different vocabulary.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but we should find out what it is.</p>
<p class="P">We have Germans here, don't we?</p>
<p class="P"><em>They can't agree with one another! (laughter)</em></p>
<p class="P">So what are we going to do?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I'll ask T.K. what she is using.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But I feel C.S. should be told he can't dictate.</em></p>
<p class="P">No, he can't dictate. How can he?... Moreover, he doesn't have the means.</p>
<p class="P"><em>For example he said that since he has a book-sales office, he would refuse to sell any book using a different terminology!</em></p>
<p class="P">That's absurd.</p>
<p class="P">What should be done for these books is to put a note in, to insert a note in each book saying that this particular word used here corresponds to that word used in the other books – to let people know. Because if it's the same word as <em>"mental,"</em> that leads to terrible confusion – terrible, the worst confusion. There has to be a distinction, it's imperative: either T.K. has to put a note or.... Because you see, if they put <em>"mental"</em> for both words, or even another word that means the same thing, it distorts the teaching immediately. It immediately creates terrible confusion.</p>
<p class="P">In any event, there should be a note explaining that the word is taken in a particular sense.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Evidently, C.S. wanted to use the same vocabulary in the other</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 69</p>
<p class="P"><em> book as the one he used in "The Adventure of Consciousness."</em></p>
<p class="P">That's reasonable enough.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes. Only I think T.K. very much objects to the use of the word "Spirit," which is not German.</em></p>
<p class="P">I don't like it either.</p>
<p class="P">But is German such a poor language? Isn't all this ignorance on their part?... They could take a word that isn't a common word and give it a special meaning – and then, put in a note the special meaning they've given the word. But to use a word that means "mind" is crazy, it immediately distorts the teaching.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes. The trouble is that the word they use for "spirit" is the word generally used for "mind." So, if it is left exclusively to mean "mind," they don't have anything for "spirit," but if they use it exclusively for "spirit," it may be interpreted as "mind."</em></p>
<p class="P">No, they should put a note.</p>
<p class="P">But don't they have another word for "mind"?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I don't know what T.K. is using, but some people have made up the word "mental" (I believe "das Mental," I don't know exactly).</em></p>
<p class="P">As long as the distinction is clear enough.... It has to be explicit.</p>

<p class="Ps"><b>ADDENDUM</b></p>
<p class="Ps">"The Schism"</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Satprem had received the following letter from an enthusiastic reader of "On the Way to Supermanhood":</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>"Until the year of grace 1969 [the descent of the New Consciousness], all philosophies, all religions, all isms, all spiritual paths were only the refined products of the 'mental circle' [according to 'Supermanhood']. All experiences were merely on 'the higher planes of the mind.' Those 'peaks of the Spirit' are but 'self-paroxysms,' p. 61; 'we must cleanse ourselves of the wisdoms of the past, the ascents of the past, the illuminations of the past and the whole racket of the old sanctities of the Spirit,' p. 29, etc. In other words, everything that took place before 1969 is a sublimation of the 'old flesh,' p. 28. It is quite clear. Some have touched the Secret: the Rishis, the Egyptians – the reader understands that they had the intuition of it but not the experience. The same applies to Sri Aurobindo, who 'announced' it, but his yoga extended the refinement of the 'mental bubble'; the reader thus understands that he did not know about the key to the yoga of the superman and was merely satisfied in teaching the integral yoga...."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>The misconception of this enthusiastic reader is like a demonstration in reverse of precisely what the "orthodox" reproached "Supermanhood" for, i.e., of having betrayed Sri Aurobindo. Behind this so-called schism were hidden, on the one hand, those who wanted to separate Mother and Sri Aurobindo and found it more comfortable to philosophize than to do the yoga concretely, and on the other hand, those who wanted conveniently to dispense with all spiritual disciplines and live according to their fancy. Two poles of the same misconception. Here then is the letter Satprem sent in response to this enthusiastic reader:</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align: right;">Pondicherry, 6. April 1971</p>
<p class="P">You have a lot of nerve to say that Sri Aurobindo did not have the key to the yoga of the superman and that his integral yoga was a refinement of the mental bubble! And where have I learned what I write, if not from Mother and Sri Aurobindo? You forget that it is thanks to him that the yoga of the superman is possible, that it is he who prepared it, he who brought down the great flood of the New Consciousness so that, instead of seeking for the Divine Truth up above, men can live it down here and walk their every step in it. It is like saying that Sri Aurobindo did not have the key to the door he opened!</p>
<p class="P">His yoga is integral because, instead of confining the quest to the spiritual heights, he has told us repeatedly that our body too must participate and we must bring the Spiritual Truth down into our body and our life. The path of ascent and all the other paths, the other planes of consciousness, are part of an integral development – for those who have the time and the special capacities that are required. But it is no longer the time for those excursions, since everything can be found <em>here</em> – since, in fact, Sri Aurobindo and Mother opened the way HERE. Please recall Mother's statement: "Sri Aurobindo came to tell us: one need not leave the earth to find the Truth, one need not leave life to find one's soul, one need not abandon the world or have limited beliefs to enter into relation with the Divine. The Divine is everywhere, in everything, and if he is hidden, it is because we do not take the trouble to find him." (<em>Questions and Answers</em>, 8.13.1958) And again this: "For many, spiritual life is meditation. As long as that nonsense is not uprooted from human consciousness, the supramental force will always find it very difficult not to be swallowed up in the obscurity of an uncomprehending human mind." (<em>Questions and Answers</em>, 4.17.1957) And if you know how to read Sri Aurobindo and Mother, you will see that they have completely described this road of here and the sunlit path – <em>On the Way to Supermanhood</em> only puts an intentionally exclusive accent on the "here," because there is no time to lose, because everyone does not have the special capacities for making large-scale explorations, and finally because we are at the Hour of God – <em>we are right there!</em> It has come. Because there really is something different in the world since 1969.</p>
<p class="P">It is not a change in Sri Aurobindo's yoga, it is the flowering of Sri Aurobindo's yoga, I dare say. I do not think that the flower of the flame tree contradicts in any way the flame tree.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P">Now, you have completely confused the psychic and the spiritual. The psychic, the soul, the Fire within, Agni, does not belong to the "mental bubble" or to any bubble: it is the Divine in matter. It is that little Fire which opens the door to the great solar Fire of the New Consciousness. It is the instrument of the yoga of the superman (when I speak of turning on the "psychic switch," I am there taking the word in the vulgar and ridiculous sense of people seeking visionary and occult experiences – not in the true sense). Others in every age have had the experience of the psychic, of the inner Fire, but aside from the Rishis, no one used it to transform matter; the religions have made a purely devotional and "mystical" thing out of it. As for "the spiritual," that includes all the planes of consciousness above the ordinary mind. It is the path of ascent. And that is where I repeatedly and emphatically, and from experience, say that those great Experiences, which have to be turned into spiritual summits, are part of the mental bubble (including the overmind): they are the rarefied summits on which the being thins out into a marvelous whiteness, immense, royal, without a ripple of trouble, in an eternal peace – which can last for millenniums without its changing the world one iota, by definition. But the spiritual is <em>not the supramental</em>, and when one touches the supramental, it seems to be almost a whole other Spirit, it is so compact, warm, powerful, present, embodied and radiantly solid in broad daylight. That is the Radiance which Sri Aurobindo and Mother came to bring down on earth – they said over and over that their yoga was new, new, new – and it is through the simple little fire inside us that we can enter into direct contact with That, without sitting in the lotus position or leaving life. When one touches That, the "spiritual" heights seem pale. That is all I have to say. So we do not at all need to be superyogis to have this contact, and those who have found Nirvana, or what have you, have not advanced one inch toward That, because the clue to That is not up there at all or outside, but in your own small capacity of flame.</p>
<p class="P">So if instead of splitting hairs, you set out boldly on the road, afire, you would perhaps discover that we are indeed at the Hour of God and that a single spark of sincere effort, at one's own level, opens doors which have been closed for millenniums.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align: right;">Satprem</p>
<p class="P">P.S. To help you read Mother, I am enclosing two texts by her.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 104</p>
<p class="Ps">*<br/>*   *<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"One could say that it is far more difficult to go from the mental to the supramental life than to go from a certain psychic emotion in life – something that is like a reflection, a luminous emanation of the divine Presence in matter – to the supramental consciousness; it is much easier to go from that into the supramental consciousness than to go from the highest intellectual speculation to any supramental vibration. Perhaps it is the word that misleads us! Perhaps it is because we call it 'supramental' that we expect to reach it through a higher intellectual mental activity. But the reality is quite different. With this very high and pure and lofty intellectual activity, one seems to go towards a kind of cold, powerless abstraction, an icy light that is surely very remote from life and still further away from the experience of the supramental reality.</p>
<p class="P">"The new substances that is spreading and acting in the world contains a warmth, a power, a joy so intense that all intellectual activity seems cold and dry beside it. And that is why the less one talks about these things, the better it is. A single instant, a single impulse of deep and true love, a single minute of deep communion with the divine Grace brings you much closer to the goal than all possible explanations."</p>
<p class="P">(<em>Questions and Answers</em>, 5.14.1958)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="Ps">*<br/>*   *<br/></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"In the other hemisphere, there is an intensity and a plenitude which result in a power different from the one here. How can I explain it? One cannot. The quality of the consciousness itself seems to change. It is not something higher than the summit we can attain here, it is not one MORE rung. Here, we have reached the end, the summit, but... it's the quality that is different. The quality, in the sense that there is a plenitude, a richness, a power (this is all a translation, you see, in our language), but there is a 'something' that... that eludes us. It is truly a new reversal of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">"When we begin living the spiritual life, a reversal of consciousness takes place which for us is the proof that we have entered the spiritual life; well, yet another one occurs when we enter the supramental world.</p>
<p class="P">"And in fact each time a new world opens up, there will perhaps be a new reversal of this kind.</p>
<p class="P">"It's as if our entire spiritual life were made of silver, whereas the supramental life is made of gold – as if our entire spiritual life</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 105</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"> here were a silvery vibration, not cold but simply a light, a light that goes right to the summit, an absolutely pure light – pure and intense – but in the other, in the supramental world, there is a richness and a power that makes all the difference. This whole spiritual life of the psychic being and of all our present consciousness, which seems so warm, so full, so wonderful, so luminous to the ordinary consciousness, well, all this splendor seems poor in comparison to the splendor of the new world.</p>
<p class="P">"I can explain the phenomenon like this: successive reversals will bring about such an EVER-NEW richness of creation from stage to stage, that it will make whatever came before seem very poor in comparison. What to us seems supremely rich compared to our ordinary life appears very poor when compared to this new reversal of consciousness."</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-31"><sup>2</sup> To throw some light on the nature of the “schism,” we include at the end of this conversation the text of a letter written by Satprem to an enthusiastic and erroneous reader.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-32"><sup>3</sup> Satprem was even accused of having “betrayed Sri Aurobindo.” There was a little clique of “intellectuals” in the Ashram, who after Sri Aurobindo's passing refused for a long time to give recognition to Mother (and even while Sri Aurobindo was there, how many letters did he have to write to defend Mother). So we suspect that this same little clique, very influential today, has never really recognized Mother, except by paying lip service, preferring to hide behind a “philosophical Sri Aurobindo,” while Mother was forcing them (or trying to force them) to do a more thorough yoga. This is the essence of the “schism.” This first reaction of the English translator thus prefigures what will break out after Mother's passing. One by one all the little waves were beginning to pile up.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-33"><sup>4</sup> The first version, the one of the third, read: 
India must recognize Bangla-Desh. <em>This is urgent.</em></p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-33-5"><sup>5</sup>In fact, again on the 18th, the day after this conversation, the president of India, V.V. Giri, in a press interview in which he was spiritedly asked why he still had not recognized Bangladesh, said, "The central government is studying the question whether recognition should be granted to Bangladesh." Then he added, "Our sympathy is with the people of Bangladesh. It is up to the Prime Minister [Indira] and the central cabinet to decide the question." (P.T.I)</p>

<p class="Ps"><b>ADDENDUM</b></p>
<p class="Ps"><em>Sri Aurobindo and Bangladesh</em></p>
<p class="P">Behind the jostle of temporary points of view and instant interests there are the Eternal Landmarks. To lose sight of them is to lose one's very way and steer onto the reefs of expediency and comfortable compromise upon which we shall founder a moment later. Behind the little frontal events is the greater tide of history and to lose sight of it is to lose one's direction and the golden thread that leads to our perfect fulfillment, be it individual or national. Those who have left their unique mark upon the labyrinth of history are the very ones who have seized the golden thread and affirmed the Greater History and the Greater Meaning against all the instant arguments and fleeting expediencies.</p>
<p class="P">The Greater History tells us that the whole earth is a single body with a single destiny, but that within that single destiny each part of the greater body, each nation, has its special role to play and its rare moments of choice when it must make the decisive gesture, its true gesture in the total movement of the great Eternal History. Each nation is a symbol. Each gesture of each nation potentially represents a little victory in the total victory or a little defeat in the total defeat. And sometimes the whole of our history is at stake at a symbolic point of the earth; and, a little gesture, a tiny turn to the right or left, has repercussions, either good or bad, down the ages and over the entire earth body.</p>
<p class="P">India is precisely such a symbol and Bangladesh is another, a little turning point in the great course of events of the earth. The time has come to consider the eternal Landmarks and read the greater tide in the small eddies. Now, the greater tide tells us that India's role is to be the spiritual heart of the terrestrial body just as, for example, the role of France is to express clarity of intellect, or that of Germany to express skill, Russia the brotherhood of man and the United States enthusiasm for adventure and practical organization, etc. But only if India is ONE can she fulfill this role, for how can one who is herself divided lead others? Thus the division of India is the first Falsehood that must disappear, for it is the symbol of the earth's division. As long as India is not one, the world cannot be one. India's striving for unity is the symbolic drama of the world's striving for unity.</p>
<p class="P">From this simple, eternal Fact follow all the conclusions and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="P"> policies that will flow with the current of the earth's destiny. Sri Aurobindo said so already in 1947, <em>"The division must and will go."</em> Dire will be the consequences for India and for the earth if we fail to heed this eternal Theorem: <em>"The old communal division into Hindus and Muslims seems now to have hardened into a permanent political division of the country,"</em> said Sri Aurobindo. <em>"It is to be hoped that this settled fact will not be accepted as settled for ever or as anything more than a temporary expedient. For if it lasts, India may be seriously weakened, even crippled: civil strife may remain always possible, possible even a new invasion and foreign conquest."</em> We now know, twenty-four years after this prophetic declaration, that China is at our gates and only awaits her hour to invade the entire continent, seizing precisely on this division of India to strike at the spiritual heart of the world and, perhaps, frustrating the realization of the entire destiny of the earth or postponing it until a future cycle after much suffering and complication.</p>
<p class="P">The Great History tells us that India must again be one, and that particular current of history is so imperative that twice already Destiny has managed to put India before the possibility of her reunification. The first time was in 1965 when Pakistan's foolish aggressiveness enabled India to counterattack and carry the battle right into the suburbs of Lahore – and up to Karachi had she but had the courage to seize boldly her destiny. The hour was indeed for a decisive choice. The Mother declared categorically: <em>"India is fighting for the triumph of Truth, and She must fight until India and Pakistan become ONE again, for such is the truth of their being."</em> At Tashkent, we yielded on the crest of a petty compromise which was to lead us into a second, more bloody and painful reef, Bangladesh. There too destiny graciously arranged to enable India to hasten to the aid of her massacred brethren – even the famous skyjacking incident of January<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="48" href="#">4</a> was, as it were, arranged by the Grace so as to spare India from delaying her intervention until it was too late (or to spare her the shame of not intervening at all and allowing Pakistan's planes to fly over her head loaded with weaponry and murderers to slaughter her brothers). But there again, yielding to the demands of the moment and to the small, shortsighted</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="P"> interests, we refused to accept the challenge of the Great Direction of our History, and we now find ourselves on the brink of a new compromise which will lead us inevitably to a third and even more disastrous and bloody reef. For one day India must inevitably face that which twice she has fled. Only each time the conditions are more disastrous for her and for the world – perhaps so disastrous that the whole earth will even be engulfed in another general conflict, while the whole story could have been resolved at the little symbolic point that is Bangladesh, at the right hour, with the right gesture and a minimum of suffering.</p>
<p class="P">For let there be no doubt about it, the Bangladesh affair is not an Indian event, it is a world event. The division of India is not a local incident, it is a terrestrial Falsehood which must disappear if the division of the world is to disappear. And here again we hear the voice of Sri Aurobindo, six months before his passing, referring to yet another phenomenon which then seemed of such slight importance, so remote, a trifling "local" affair at the other end of the world: the invasion of South Korea in 1950, twenty-one years ago. And yet that small Korean symbol, like the small symbol of Bangladesh (or the one of Czechoslovakia in 1938), contained in seed the whole fatal course which is still carrying the world toward a sinister destiny: <em>"The affair of Korea,"</em> wrote Sri Aurobindo, <em>"is the first move in the Communist plan of campaign to dominate and take possession first of these northern parts and then of South East Asia as a preliminary to their manoeuvres with regard to the rest of the continent – in passing, Tibet as a gate opening to India."</em> Now, twenty-one years later, we see that Tibet and the whole of South East Asia have been swallowed up and the "gate into India" has truly been opened wide by the wound of the Pakistani Falsehood – already, or very shortly, the Chinese are, or will be, in Khulna, some eighty miles from Calcutta, to help Yahya Khan to "pacify" Bengal. And Sri Aurobindo added, <em>"If they succeed, there is no reason why domination of the whole world should not follow by steps until they are ready to deal with America."</em></p>
<p class="P">This is where we are today. That which we want to avoid returns upon us with tenfold force. The hour for political calculation, for the pros and cons of our petty mathematics of expediency (which always goes awry) is past. The time has come to rediscover the Great Direction of India, which is really the Great Direction of the world, and to place our faith in the Spirit that guides her Destiny, rejecting petty fears of a phantom world opinion and doing away</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 140</p>
<p class="P"> with the little supports which only lend support to the Enemy. Tomorrow America will perhaps resume her economic aid to Pakistan on the pretext of counteracting the Chinese presence. The Bangladesh slaughter will be honorably justified by a pseudoregime which will operate with the blessings of the international community. But one does not cheat the tide of history: for the third time our little compromises will crumble and we will find ourselves confronted with a terrible ordeal, its intensity nourished by our own successive failures in the past. The sooner not only India, but America and Russia too, understand the unreality of Pakistan and the magnitude of what is at stake at the borders of India, the sooner may the looming catastrophe be halted before it becomes totally and definitely irrevocable. <em>"One thing is certain,"</em> wrote Sri Aurobindo a few months before his passing, <em>"that if there is too much shilly-shallying and if America gives up now her defence of Korea"</em> [we could say even more: the defense of Bangladesh] <em>"she may be driven to yield position after position until it is too late: at one point or another she will have to stand and face the necessity of drastic action even if it leads to war."</em></p>
<p class="P">For the battle of India is the battle of the world. This is where the world's tragic destiny is brewing, or its last-minute burst of hope into a new world of Truth and Light, for it is said that the deepest darkness lies nearest the most luminous light.</p>

<p class="P">So then, what have you brought?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, and you, what do YOU say?</em></p>
<p class="P">Me, I don't say anything.... I mean if the Lord wants success for us, it can be BREATHTAKING. There is the possibility of a breathtaking success – not in the sky: here. The only thing is to know whether the time for success has come.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">It seems that things are much better in Auroville. S. is particularly interested and goes there, and she sent me word that there is a great progress in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, good.</em></p>
<p class="P">I tell you, everywhere there's a possibility for an... extraordinary success. Has the moment come? I don't know.... Personally, I make myself like this (<em>tiny gesture</em>), physically very small, and I let... (<em>gesture open to the Lord</em>).</p>
<p class="P">I would like.... You see, the Will comes, but then all the formations come in and decay its execution – I would like... I would like my atmosphere to be... a limpid transmitter, utterly limpid. I don't even try to know what it is, because that too introduces an ordinary human element. A limpid, limpid transmitter: let it come like this (<em>gesture of direct descent</em>), pure, in all its purity – even if it is overwhelming.</p>
<p class="P">At bottom we don't know why one thing is like this, another thing is like that, and our vision is... even if our vision is worldwide, it is so small, so small – so exclusive: we want this, we do not want that. First and FOREMOST to be an instrument: we must be LIMPID, limpid, things must pass through undistorted and unobstructed.</p>
<p class="P">Actually, that's how I spend all my time, trying to be like that.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But is that possibility of victory which you feel something recent?</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 143</p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's recent; because apparently circumstances are obviously not so good – apparently.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, you know.... All circumstances seemed to be poised for a disaster.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">Just a few days ago, the disaster seemed to be closing in. And so, at that moment, it was as if my whole being... what's the word? (<em>Mother clenches her fists</em>), were, yes, you can call it an aspiration for the true Victory – not the one sought by this side or that side or... – the true Victory. ALL the difficulties seemed to have been as though a light shone: the possibility of Victory. It's still... not miraculous, but the intervention... it's the intervention of the Supreme Wisdom – will it concretize? We'll see. It seems, it seems to be coming like this (<em>gesture at a certain height, her two palms turned downward</em>), as a possibility.</p>
<p class="P">Yes, it's recent, quite recent. I can't say because it didn't come abruptly, but it's a matter of days.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, because for some time, I was feeling a great pessimism.</em></p>
<p class="P">That's a bad attitude.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, I didn't really have that attitude, but it's like an atmosphere of pessimism that came.</em></p>
<p class="P">That's always there.... It's everything that does not want the Divine which creates the atmosphere deliberately to discourage those who want the Divine. You must... you mustn't pay any attention. It's the device of the devil. Pessimism is the devil's tool, for he feels his own situation is... (<em>shaky gesture</em>). You know, if the possibility I see materializes, it will really be a decisive Victory over the adverse forces – naturally they fight back as best as they can. But that's always the devil, as soon as you see even the tail of pessimism, it's the devil. That's his great tool.</p>

And so now it's got into the habit of repeating its mantra, and it repeats it ALL THE TIME. It's a curious thing: if it repeats it, everything runs smoothly; if it doesn't, it can't even swallow food – everything seems on the verge of falling apart; so it repeats its mantra, and everything goes quite well. When it thinks of nothing but the Divine, everything is fine. This morning, while I was having breakfast, that's how it was. It was so plain!

The body asks but one thing, to melt into the Divine, to be nothing but That, to cease to exist separately – then all is well. It's very interesting. It's really the sadhana of the body, and in quite a compelling way – absolutely compelling. And when it leaves That, it feels it's going to disintegrate the very next minute – that it is the only thing that keeps it together; without That, it doesn't exist anymore.</p>

In any case, it has become ready [Mother's body] to live without an ego.... The trouble is that life's ordinary laws no longer hold. Which means all the old habit, plus the new thing to be learned.</p>
<p class="P">It's as if the cells – not the body's cells: the organization that makes up the form (that holds everything together and makes up a form, a form we call human), it's as if that had to learn it can go on living without the sense of separate individuality. Curious. Without the sense of ego. While for thousands of years it's been accustomed to existing separately only because of the ego – without ego it goes on... according to another law the body doesn't yet know, and which... it finds incomprehensible. It</p>

<p class="P">There's an onslaught of adverse forces. A ferocious onslaught. But the Response is beginning to come – just a very small beginning. In each person there was like a storm, and it's not completely over.

<p class="P">There's a dreadful onslaught of Falsehood. It was as if everyone were lying, even the most unexpected persons – everywhere, but everywhere. And to me it was vivid (<em>Mother makes a gesture of seeing it</em>), oh, horrible! You can't imagine.... This, a little twisted to the right; that, a little twisted to the left, just a little twisted – nothing, not a thing was straight. Then the body asked, "And where is your own falsehood?" It took a look at itself. And it was that old</p>

<p class="P">It wasn't aggressive, it had the appearance of humility – it got a good cuff.</p>
<p class="P">There was a battering of unpleasant things – more than unpleasant: really, but really mean and nasty and destructive. A battering, until the body understood. Then this feeling came into the whole body, in all the cells, everywhere, all the time (it came to such a pitch that I could barely swallow food), until everything, all-all understood: "I exist only by the Divine, I can go on living only by the Divine... and I can be myself only by being the Divine." After that, it was better. Now the body has understood.</p>

<p class="P">You have nothing to ask, nothing to say?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I feel a bad destiny hangs over me.</em></p>
<p class="P">No, that's not true! It's part of the Falsehood, that's the Falsehood – it's part of the Falsehood. I had seen that, I have seen it; I have tried to remove it, I haven't succeeded.... There is no bad destiny, that's humbug! A downright lie. It isn't true – it isn't at all true, not at all, at all.</p>
<p class="P">Here, that's just a perfect example for you: it's exactly like that – it's likewise everywhere (<em>Mother makes a gesture with claws</em>). I can almost see mean little devils with claws trying to hook onto each and everyone.</p>

Quite the contrary, the course I saw [for you] recently is an increasingly beneficial influence over people through your writing, and something – I told you about it – which is spreading and is going to have an action everywhere. But of course the devil doesn't like that, so he tries... (<em>gesture of claws</em>). Ah, you should look straight at him and laugh – stick your tongue out at him like a naughty boy.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Well, in any case, one is assailed.</em></p>

<p class="P">There isn't any "you," there isn't any "we must be patient," there isn't any "it will come in its own time," there isn't any... of all those very reasonable things, they don't exist anymore – it's That (<em>Mother lowers her fist sharply</em>), like a sword-blade. It's That. And it's That DESPITE EVERYTHING: the Divine. The Divine alone. All that hodgepodge of bad will and revolt and... all that (<em>Mother raises an unalterable finger</em>) has to be swept away.</p>
<p class="P">And that which says that we will perish or be destroyed by That is the ego – it is Mr. Ego trying to pass himself off as the true being.</p>
<p class="P">But the body has learned that even without ego it is what it is, because it is that by the Divine Will and not at all by the ego – we exist by the Divine Will and not by the ego. The ego was a means – a centuries-old means. Centuries old. Now, it's worthless, it's time is over. It had its time, it had its usefulness – it's over, it's past, it's way past. Now... (<em>Mother lowers her fist sharply</em>): consciousness is the Divine; power is the Divine; action is the Divine; individuality is the Divine.</p>
<p class="P">And the body has understood, sensed very well; it has <em>realized</em> and <em>understood</em>, as they say in English, that the sense of being a separate personality is PERFECTLY useless, perfectly useless, it is not in the least indispensable to its existence, it's perfectly useless. It exists by another power and another will, which is not individual, not personal: the Divine Will. And it will become what it is supposed to be the day it feels there is no difference between itself and the Divine. That's all.</p>
<p class="P">All the rest is falsehood – false, false, false, and a falsehood that must disappear. There is only ONE reality, there is only ONE life, there is only ONE consciousness (<em>Mother lowers her fist sharply</em>): the Divine.</p>

<p class="P">"Every sadhak has by nature certain characteristics which are a great obstacle on the way of the sadhana; these remain with obstinacy and can only be overcome after a very long time by an action of the Divine from within. Your mistake is not to have these defects, others have defects of anger, jealousy, envy, etc. very strongly and not only have them within but show them very openly – but to accept it as a reason for despair and the wish to go away from here. There is absolutely no meaning in going away, for nothing would be gained by it. One does not escape from what is within oneself by changing place; it follows and reproduces itself under other circumstances and among other surroundings. To go away and die does not solve anything either; for one's being and nature do not end with death, they continue. The only way to get rid of them is here. Here, if you remain, a time is sure to come when these things will go out of you. The suffering it causes cannot cease by going out – it can only cease by the inner cause being removed or else by your drawing back from them and realising your true self which even if they rise would not be troubled by them and would refuse to regard them as part of itself – this liberation too can only come here by sadhana."</p>

It is obviously very troublesome. One has to keep a firm mind as much as possible. There are two ways of dealing with it. One is to sit quiet with a silent will to get rapidly through to the true thing and allow the Force to work out the difficulty. The other is effort, but this effort too must be a quiet effort, – if it is a struggling or over eager effort, it may increase the struggle and restlessness in the mind or body. The best way is to keep quiet, observe, will for the change in reliance on the working of the Force, but also to use a quiet effort whenever that is possible. If one does that, after a time one finds a quiet action becoming habitual which whenever the outer force comes to pull the mind out, repels it automatically and maintains the poise of the consciousness."</p>

<p class="P">"It is not however a fact that the whole nature has to be emptied of the old things before there can be the Light and Grace.

It has risen up with the insistence on the value of its own small ignorant ideas and feelings and refusing to let them go. When the psychic comes forward, all larger and more enlightened movements replace them. But usually before that happens, these things rise up and control the consciousness for a while. This state need not be a permanent condition and if one sees clearly and rejects them consciously, then it can be got over quickly – but even if it lasts a long period, it can in the end be overcome and that is happening to many now. Naturally, the physical consciousness persuades the mind that it is everlasting and cannot be got over; but that is not true."</p>

The Ashram is a sort of communal hotel or mess, the Mother is the hotel-keeper or mess-manager. One gives what one can or chooses to give, or it may be nothing at all except the aforesaid commodity; in return the palate, the stomach and all the physical demands have to be satisfied to the full; if not, one has every right to keep one's money and to abuse the defaulting hotel-keeper or mess-manager.

<p class="P">"There are only two possible foundations for the material life here. One is that one is a member of an Ashram founded on the principle of self-giving and surrender. One belongs to the Divine and all one has belongs to the Divine; in giving one gives not what is one's own but what already belongs to the Divine. There is no question of payment or return, no bargain, no room for demand and desire. The Mother is in sole charge and arranges things as best they can be arranged within the means at her disposal and the capacities of her instruments. She is under no obligation to act according to the mental standards or vital desires and claims of the Sadhaks; she is not obliged to use a democratic equality in her dealings with them. She is free to deal with each according to what she sees to be his true need or what is best for him in his spiritual progress. No one can be her judge or impose on her his own rule and standard; she alone can make rules, and she can depart from them too if she thinks fit, but no one can demand that she shall do so. Personal demands and desires cannot be imposed on her. If anyone has what he finds to be a real need or a suggestion to make which is within the province assigned to him, he can do so; but if she gives no sanction, he must remain satisfied and drop the matter. This is the spiritual discipline of which the one who represents or embodies the Divine Truth is the centre. Either she is that and all this is the plain common sense of the matter; or she is not and then no one need stay here. Each can go his own way and there is no Ashram and no Yoga."</p>

<p class="P"><em>Inevitable?</em></p>
<p class="P">They're expecting it to break out any day.... America has sent shiploads of arms to Pakistan; so before declaring war, the Indian government wants to ask America to stop their shipments to Pakistan and recall the ships on the high seas.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">1</a></p>

<p class="P">It's extremely mixed. Precisely the sensation that there isn't a <em>clear-cut</em> delineation between truth on one side and falsehood on the other, that it's all a mishmash.</p>
<p class="P">I have the feeling that things are held like this (<em>gesture of being immobilized under pressure</em>): it is willed that Sri Aurobindo's Centenary takes place – if there were a war, it would be difficult. In Delhi, they were thinking the war would break out within a week – they had said that, again yesterday they told me it's imminent. And at the same time there is something which goes like this (<em>same gesture of immobilizing pressure</em>) to keep things in this uncertain state so that Sri Aurobindo's Centenary may have its full development – so I see that mixture of things. The feeling is that the Centenary is the major event, while at the same time the outer consciousness says that if there is war, it will be the end of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 176</p>
<p class="P"> the Centenary. There you are, that's how it is. So I don't see anything precise because things are like that, all intertwined.... If I see something clearly, naturally I'll say so, but now I don't. It's mixed up, all mixed up – completely mixed up. And there is an insistence on us, a pressure on us to be primarily concerned with the Centenary, for that to be our primary preoccupation; not to take current events too much into account, you know. That's what I see – not so interesting! (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Sujata:) But Mother, shouldn't the problem of India and Pakistan in fact be settled for the Centenary?</em></p>
<p class="P">That's what I was hoping for.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Sujata:) Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">But nothing stands out. It would be marvelous, but....</p>
<p class="P">Although to tell the truth, I am more and more absorbed with being a completely limpid transmitter than with knowing – I don't care about knowing: just being as limpid as possible so that, at least in one place, That may manifest without too much opposition. That's all.</p>
<p class="P">We must be patient.</p>
<p class="P">Not be anxious to know. One must be more eager to be an unobstructing intermediary than to know – you understand? It's more important to keep the atmosphere as limpid and transparent as possible, more important than to know in advance what's going to happen. That's my position.</p>

<p class="P">You know, it's as if the two extremes – a marvelous state and a general decomposition – were here like this (<em>gesture of being inextricably intertwined</em>). Everything, but everything is falling apart: people you count on give way, it seems there's a general dishonesty spreading, people getting sick all the time.... As difficulties go, there have NEVER been so many, never, and compounded: big difficulties with ruinous ones. But at the same time, for... a flash (it comes for a few minutes, then it goes away), there is a... marvelous state (the body feels it), unimaginable, you know, like the extreme opposite. As if it wanted to take over – but the other fights back fiercely. And so, all circumstances are like that, all the people are like that, from the government on down to the people here. And then that marvelous state: it comes into my body for a few minutes, then it goes away.</p>
<p class="P">It's so... horrible, you know – just everyone, all the people you count on, everything, all, all is falling to pieces; so much so that the consciousness wonders: "But what is this hell, this is no life!" And then, at another moment – but for a few minutes only – there's such a marvelous state that it's unimaginable. There you are. That's what I've been living since... night and day without letup.</p>
<p class="P">This morning for a few minutes it was absolutely marvelous, but the rest of the time it's infernal. There you are, you see, that's life for you. Everything, all, all seems to be falling apart, the people you count on give way, but at the same time, all of a sudden.... It's 90 percent like that, but the 10 percent is so marvelous that it's unimaginable. That's how things are.</p>
<p class="P">And all the ideas of personal will or of a certain attitude to take are.... Night and day, ceaselessly, whatever the difficulties, my body simply says, "My God, let Your Will be done." The body's attitude is steadfast: it is completely like this (<em>hands open in offering</em>). And the sense of its own powerlessness... no: for as much as the sense of self is left (it's not much, not much is left), but the little that is left is so powerless, so impotent, so ignorant... ignorant! Frightfully ignorant of everything. It's something.... One wonders why, what's the reason for this (<em>Mother touches her body</em>). And then... (<em>gesture of a marvelous flash</em>). That's how it is.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 182</p>
<p class="P">And the other side doesn't create any problems. It's... as if you were absolutely sick, a total mess, and all of a sudden you're marvelously well, strong. And it comes very naturally, without any fuss. It remains there, and then pfft!</p>
<p class="P">All our reasoning, all our... : in pieces – no longer worth anything.</p>
<p class="P">And all the people needed to operate the organization, all the persons you count on, ploff! they fall through.</p>
<p class="P">You see, it's got to the point that eating is becoming a problem, sleeping is becoming a problem, speaking is becoming a problem – everything is a problem – but then at the same time... it gets done, one doesn't know how: things fall into place, and one eats, one rests.... For instance, I am lying down, I am so uncomfortable that I think, "It's impossible, I can't stay here," and then all of a sudden, poff! nothing anymore: a marvelous repose. And there is no more body, no more problem, nothing. And then without knowing the why or the how, suddenly the difficulties are back. And it's like that, all of life is like that.</p>
<p class="P">So people come and tell me, "I have this problem, that problem...." "Look," I tell them (<em>exasperated tone</em>), "no wonder the whole world is like that!" It can perish for all I care... it would be a relief. There you are. But then... (<em>gesture of a marvelous flash</em>). Three minutes of splendor for twelve hours of misery. That's the ratio. And for a body that truly, sincerely... thinks only of the Divine, wants only the Divine. But it is utterly conscious of its incapacity.</p>
<p class="P">You know, it's like a live demonstration of the existence of the Divine and what the Divine existence is – an absolute existence and what it is – and then what it has become.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I don't hear, I don't see, I can't eat, I can't speak – all that seemingly deteriorated – I don't understand, I no longer remember; and at the same time, all of a sudden, the sense of... a sovereign omnipotence in... something... a bliss that has no equivalent in our world. That's how it is. And that's simply as if to tell me, "Yes, it's true: that's IT; that's what we want and that's what will have to be...." But when?... That's all.</p>
<p class="P">And so it makes you... (everyone is complaining, everyone is moaning, everyone is talking about his troubles), it makes you indifferent and you say, "Well, what would you, the world is like that!"</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 183</p>
<p class="P">The world is "like that," but it isn't true! It is NOT like that – it's like that for our consciousness.... For a while this morning, I wondered, "What is it like in the consciousness of wild animals?..." And I saw that the consciousness capable of seeing the whole doesn't exist for animals, they don't have it – they live from day to day and minute to minute whatever happens to them. That's all. I understand that, I saw, it's the... (<em>gesture to the forehead indicating that the mind spoils everything</em>).</p>

<p class="P">In short, it's becoming very, very critical: how far the world is from what it should be. Usually people say there's a mixture of good and bad things; but all that is childish – the good things aren't any better than the bad ones. That's not IT. The Divine is something else.</p>

<p class="P">But, of course, that's what I've just told you: everything is falling apart – everything and everybody. It's a fact – well, that fact is there to tell us, "This is what must cease to be." For the ordinary human consciousness, that's the reality – well, it's not true, that's all. We just have to tell ourselves it's not true.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I mean, for example, what I have written is no longer a living reality for me.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, exactly.... That's because you're moving on to the other side, like me. That's all.</p>

<p class="P">But suddenly... all of a sudden there's the Force... a Force – we call it "force" because... we don't know what it is – an almighty Force. But fleeting: it comes, it vanishes.</p>
<p class="P">But my body has the experience, my body knows that does not go away; it knows it is incapable of feeling it, but it knows it doesn't go away.</p>
<p class="P"><em>For me it's like the bankruptcy of the whole teaching. The whole teaching seems like a fabrication of the higher mind and nothing more – something that has no concrete reality.</em></p>

<p class="P">The experience in the body is very interesting. All so-called moral, intellectual, psychological suffering, in other words, the suffering of the consciousness that is not purely material, seems childish to the body. Yesterday, it had... (what shall I say? I don't know how to explain it). It doesn't feel things in relation to itself, it feels things... (<em>silence</em>) IN others, but with a general consciousness, not a personal one; and it has such a horror of physical suffering, that is to say illnesses, accidents, that it wondered why, why the world exists like that.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="58" href="#">1</a> It then understood why some people don't want to have a body anymore (that always seemed absurd before), it understood why. It was such an intense experience! It had an aspiration, something like a prayer, but it's not a prayer: "May the world change! May the world change. It HAS to change – or else disappear." The idea of disappearing had not come before, it seemed... it used to think that the world was</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 187</p>
<p class="P"> moving towards a harmonious perfection; but, you see, it's long – the length of time is terrible! There was an aspiration of incredible intensity for the transformation. Everything looks so dreadful because... because the transformation must, MUST take place. That anyone can be satisfied with a world like this is impossible – it's impossible to a physical consciousness that is conscious of the Divine. It's impossible, it absolutely has to change. And that was so vivid... I was gripped by it all night and all day, even while seeing people, with such an intensity: it must change, it must change....</p>
<p class="P">The being, the inner consciousness can say and be conscious that that suffering is unreal, but the physical consciousness can't – it can't, it HAS to change. It's not a matter of merging with a consciousness, leaving this physical consciousness to disappear: it has to change, it has to change.... I can't put it into words, I can't say it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, yes, I understand.</em></p>
<p class="P">It is so very conscious that in all the worlds, even the vital world, everything depends on the attitude, and if you are in contact with the Divine, everything is fine, there's no problem, but this (<em>Mother touches her body</em>), this physical suffering – cancer and all those things – it's so concrete: It HAS to change, it has to change. It can't be considered something one must "see in a different way." It actually must change. You understand what I mean?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">In all the other domains, it depends on the attitude; here it doesn't depend on the attitude – you may suffer more, suffer less, but.... The FACT has to change, you see. Because the world, the material world seen as it is, is a FRIGHTFUL thing.</p>
<p class="P">You see, it is bearable due to the mental influence (vital and mental), but that influence is not enough, it has to be transformed.</p>
<p class="P">Let me say it in a very down-to-earth way: for example, take a supramental being having the supramental consciousness, if his body gets cancer, it will remain cancer, you follow?... He may not feel anything, but only if he detaches himself from his body; whereas, for the transformation to be genuine, the body ALSO has to attain a harmony above – above all illnesses and accidents.</p>
<p class="P">It is the only part. The other parts of the being can be transformed,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 188</p>
<p class="P"> can transform their consciousness while remaining what they are – but the physical body needs to change.</p>
<p class="P">I don't know whether it's a passing experience or a final one – that I don't know. We'll see.</p>
<p class="P"><em>And yet with a supramental consciousness, it should be impossible to get cancer, for example.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but that means... it means the material substance is transformed.</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, I meant simply the consciousness: if someone has the supramental consciousness, that consciousness should be able to protect the body sufficiently, shouldn't it?</em></p>

<p class="P">You know, I always felt, always: if something isn't right, it means that this something isn't really turned to the Divine.

<p class="P">The whole earth is now under one law and answers to the same vibrations and I am sceptical of finding any place where the clash of the struggle will not pursue us.

<p class="P">One needs to have a calm heart, a settled will, entire self-abnegation and the eyes constantly fixed on the beyond to live undiscouraged in times like these which are truly a period of universal decomposition.

<p class="P">Day before yesterday I was almost cured, I thought it was over, but then yesterday there was an avalanche of things... oh, bad will, quarrels and... it was so dreadful that the cold started up again. That's why it won't go away. I see that when things quiet down here and I can get back into my normal atmosphere, it's as if everything vanished – I don't have a cold anymore, I am not in pain anymore. But back it comes from outside like a ferocious attack: people quarreling, squabbling, circumstances going awry, everything. And all that is thrown on me, so....</p>
<p class="P">So it started up again last evening. It was over, you know: my nose and throat were clear, it was all gone. It really isn't me, it comes from outside. It's relentless. And naturally they all hold me responsible! I tell them one thing, they do another; I write them one thing, they twist it and make it into something else, and then afterwards, they say it's my fault. That's how it is. (<em>Mother starts to cough</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Thoroughly charming.</p>
<p class="P">In a way, it was like a demonstration – like a stage play, you know, showing how people behave with the Divine. It was really comical!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 194</p>
<p class="P"> You may get angry and say, "How shameful!" – but it was comical. It was laughable: everything is the Divine's fault! That's how people are commonly: it's the Divine who ill-uses them, the Divine who does not spare them, the Divine who arranges circumstances wrongly.... That's how it is. They're all like that.</p>
<p class="P">And it's a kind of half-conscious malice: you do this, they just do that (<em>slight twist</em>), they twist it a little, and everything becomes distorted; you say one thing, they add a word or take one out and it's all distorted. Even what is written they read in their own way. It's stunning.</p>
<p class="P">And it's on a large scale, you see, almost a world scale, at least a national one, in this country, but... it has repercussions in China, Russia, Europe, America. They've made... such a <em>mess</em>, you know, with this whole [Bangladesh] affair, it's dreadful – dreadful. Now, they've found a solution: the Americans are trying to come to an agreement with the Chinese – that's the last straw! – to help Pakistan massacre people.</p>

<p class="P">No, of course not!</p>

<p class="P">Oh!... No, that's just appalling!... She said to me, "Could my children come back here?" That's typically her. (And there's also something she is not saying.) And so naturally at once I told her yes. I said, "If you like, you can stay." She said, "Oh, I really would like to stay."</p>
<p class="P">It's like this (<em>gesture of twisting</em>), everyone is that way.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, everything is twisted.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>then the conversation moves on to the disciple in the Vatican</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Z says that P.L. did not behave well at all, that he is caught up in a world of money, power, women and... I don't know what – that he is completely under Monsignor R.'s thumb, you know, the one who is handling millions.</em></p>

<p class="P">I must tell you that occultly I had seen that a lot of money could come here through P.L. So naturally I increased his rapport [with the Force]. And normally it should come.</p>

<p class="P">There's an onslaught of Falsehood. And you feel that only what is really true has the power to resist – a bit above the mind.</p>
<p class="P">But that [Z's words] gives you an example of how things are – it's really a sort of derailment. Did she really say, "Mother asked me"?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes: "Mother told me to stay."</em></p>
<p class="P">She said "told" or....</p>
<p class="P"><em>She said, "Mother told me." Well, anyway the way it is said means... "Yes, Mother told me to stay," as if it were an order or advice that you gave her.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes... that's it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Oh, if you knew the experiences.... Just this kind of things [Z's words], everywhere, everywhere, all the time, from everyone-everything, everything is like this (<em>gesture of twisting</em>) oh!... And so my body, the body, said, "But I am like that too!" It saw its.... Oh, my God... (<em>Mother clasps her hands together</em>) I understood</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 197</p>
<p class="P"> that if for a single minute the Supreme Consciousness had the kind of consciousness men have, the world would be dissolved. Quite spontaneously, our reaction, our spontaneous reaction to conflicts, to what seems bad to us, is: let's dissolve the Falsehood. It's a spontaneous reaction. Not transform – dissolve. You see, there's a gulf between the two.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">And it's spontaneous, it's the idea of doing away – doing away with the Falsehood. But if for a single second the Supreme Lord had that movement, there would be no more world!... And so I think the body has understood that. I think it understood, it was extraordinary.... What are we anyway! What are men! They think they're, my God (<em>Mother makes a gesture of puffing herself up</em>), they think they're... oh!... For the slightest will, or a slight comprehension, or when they make a slight effort for perfection, oh! (<em>same gesture</em>) they think they're, they think they're just extraordinary! (<em>Mother takes her head in her hands and laughs.</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Somewhere Sri Aurobindo wrote that when you touched the Divine Consciousness, it suddenly gave you the sense of... how laughable the world is in its self-conceit – men's self-conceit. But even (I've had contact with animals), even in animals it begins. Vanity, vanity, vanity, vanity....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Indeed, there's really nothing to brag about.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, no!</p>
<p class="P"><em>That's for sure.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, no! – no, it's not so much that they brag, but they are SELF-CONCEITED.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You know, almost everywhere deception and attempts at deception are taken for goodwill. As for those who don't seek to deceive anybody but only deceive themselves, they are already exceptional beings.</p>
<p class="P">These aren't discoveries, they are things I used to see; but you see them only occasionally, by way of exception, in one instance or another, whereas there I had the vision of the whole world, of the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 198</p>
<p class="P"> entire earth, of all human effort, of all peoples, all... we live in a deception. It's frightful!</p>

<p class="P">There's only one salvation: to cling to the Divine like this (<em>gesture with two fists</em>).</p>
<p class="P">Not clinging to what one thinks of the Divine, not even to what one feels of the Divine... to an aspiration... an aspiration as sincere as possible. And cling to that.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I am going to tell you something, because it's interesting. Sometime ago, before Z came back, I suddenly saw that Z's relationship with P.L. was preventing him from doing what he had to do. And so I really aspired for her to cease having an influence on him. (I had forgotten that, it was sometime before she came back, a rather long time before.)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, I remember, you even told me about it.</em></p>
<p class="P">It's curious.</p>
<p class="P">You know, something I would have told you already is that now the body – the consciousness of the body – knows in advance what's going to happen, it knows in advance what people are going to say. It doesn't know it... (how shall I put it?) exactly as it happens in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 199</p>
<p class="P"> reality, but rather the SPIRIT in which it's done... constantly. It's perfectly strange. I am here immobile, trying to belong only to the Divine, and things come – they come like this (<em>gesture as though on a screen in front of Mother</em>), they come like this, things, events, people talking.... At first I thought it was my material consciousness, which did not know how to keep quiet, but then I realized it was coming to me from outside and was taking shape materially. Which means that now, if I were to mentalize those things, I could foresee events, tell what is going to happen, what's going to come.... The story about America and China, and all sorts of similar things came in that way. In ordinary men, the mind takes advantage of it to make prophecies – but fortunately there isn't any mind here, it's quiet, it's absent. Only, when I am told things, when I am informed of things, nothing surprises this body anymore, it seems to know. It's strange.</p>
<p class="P">A kind of universalization.</p>
<p class="P">And if you knew how stupid the body feels – both things at the same time.</p>

<p class="P">Me? I still have a cold. I was cured, I was almost cured, but... (<em>gesture of an avalanche</em>). But this isn't interesting.</p>
<p class="P">What's interesting is that the body is becoming more and more conscious, but conscious in a very interesting way.</p>
<p class="P"><em>For example?</em></p>
<p class="P">That would mean mentalizing. I can't.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 200</p>
<p class="P">I am beginning to know what's going to happen, what people are going to tell me, all that. How can I explain it?... It's as if I had BECOME the circumstances, the people, the words, the....</p>
<p class="P">The body is more and more conscious, but not at all mentally – like... like things actually lived. I don't know how to say it. It's hard to explain.... It's sensing or having the... (I don't know how to explain exactly what it is) how, in the manifestation, the human consciousness distorts the Divine Action (<em>gesture of direct flow</em>). It's our constitution which is so pitiable. We reduce, distort, diminish EVERYTHING – everything. We know things (Knowledge is there all around us, in us), but we are so complicated that we distort it. Everyone is that way.... So then, this is a kind of very accurate sensation of everything that is organized by the inner Divine from within, and at the same time how it gets distorted as it surfaces (words are silly, and yet that's the closest I can come). It's our silly way of saying something that is... so simple and so marvelous!... But we are so perverted that we always choose what is distorted.</p>
<p class="P">I don't know, even my words distort the thing, but it's... it's something I feel is so simple, so luminous, so pure – so absolute. And then, we make of it what we can see around us: a complicated and almost incomprehensible life.</p>
<p class="P">But what about you, don't you have any news?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I'm in a phase I don't understand very well.</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah!... Well, tell me, that way we can find out what it is.</p>
<p class="P"><em>There's nothing to tell.... I don't know, it's like a collapse of everything or a destruction of everything. There's no more base. Previously there were a certain number of "truths," let's say ...</em></p>
<p class="P">Aha!</p>
<p class="P"><em>... which were plain to me, like what I expressed in my books – it's as if all that had turned to dust. As if it didn't have any... yes, it's dust. I don't have a single sure idea I can lean on. There are no more reference points.</em></p>
<p class="P">But that's exactly what I just said in different words! Everything</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 201</p>
<p class="P"> we think (it's been ages since I had any ideas), is like that, it seems so futilely futile, I don't know.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes. I well understand that all thought is futile and deceptive, that, I do understand. But one would like to have a beacon... a practical beacon: to understand.</em></p>
<p class="P">But for me the practical beacon is very simple: the Divine. That's the only concrete thing for me.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, of course, there's the Force, I always feel the Force and... and it's very pleasant, if I may say so.</em></p>
<p class="P">But that's it, you see, there's only that!</p>
<p class="P"><em>But I feel I'm walking like a blind man in that Force.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, being blind isn't pleasant!</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, of course. Yes, but.... But why not! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) It's come to such a point that.... For instance, I am here, there are lots of circumstances, complications, people... and everything is so tangled up; but then in the background there is a sort of... it's not a mere Force, it's a CONSCIOUSNESS-Force – a consciousness – and it's like a... like a smile – a smile... a smile that knows everything. That's it, you see. So, when I am quiet (<em>gesture of open hands</em>), it's as if nothing existed and all is marvelous. Then, as soon as people speak to me or I see someone, all the complications are back – they make a mess of everything.</p>
<p class="P">I am sure that it's the passage from this life to that Life. When we are completely on that side, oh, we'll stop speculating, wanting to "explain," wanting to deduce, conclude, arrange – all that will be over.... If we knew how... to be – simply to BE, to be. But for us, I have noticed, if we don't speak, if we don't think, if we don't decide, we feel we are outside life.... And besides it's not always the same kind of silence. It isn't the silence of unexpressed words, it's the silence of... an active contemplation. The silence of an active contemplation. That's it.</p>
<p class="P">It's certainly the preparation for a new mode of life. So the other one has to yield its place.</p>

I have this vision in which the psychic consciousness sees that through this instrument, through this (but this – <em>Mother pinches the skin of her hands</em> – has nothing to do with it except being the link between things as they are and the things that are to be), well, through this, A GREAT NUMBER of miracles are being done; and they are so extraordinary (lately) that it occurred to no one that they were miracles!...

Sometimes I am completely cured, everything, but everything works well, a minute later, everything breaks down. It's not a cold you "cure." Taking a medicine does not make any difference, while if you go into the true consciousness, everything is over. But it is incapable of staying there. It's not so much the contact with people, it's that it is incapable of staying there, that's what it is. It can't blame anyone else.</p>
<p class="P">It is no longer this, it is not yet "that" – no longer this, not yet "that." There you are. So... (<em>same gesture of swinging back and forth</em>).</p>

<p class="P">The body feels it's no longer here: this holds no reality for it anymore, but it's not yet THERE. So it's like this (<em>oscillating gesture between the two</em>). It aspires.

<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">It's as if all the ways of seeing the world were passing by one after the other: the most detestable and the most marvelous – like this, like that, like this... (<em>Mother turns her head like a kaleidoscope</em>), and they all come to tell me: "See, you can look at it this way, you can look at it that way, you can...." But the Truth... what is true?... What is true?... There is all that (<em>same kaleidoscopic gesture</em>), and "something" we don't know.</p>
<p class="P">First of all, I am convinced that the need to see things, to think them, is purely human and is a transitory device. It is a transitory phase, which seems terribly long to us, but in fact is rather short.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 226</p>
<p class="P">Even our consciousness is an adaptation of the Consciousness – THE Consciousness, the true consciousness is something else.</p>
<p class="P">And so the conclusion for my body is... (as best as I can translate it): to curl up in the Divine. Not to try to understand, not to try to know: try TO BE.... And to curl up. So I spend my time like that.</p>
<p class="P">Not "try": only one minute like that is enough (<em>gesture of stepping backward</em>), and time doesn't matter anymore. It's very curious, I make experiments for every little movement of life, like meals, for example; well, when I curl up like this (<em>gesture of interiorization</em>), everything seems instantaneous. There isn't any time. When I am in the outer consciousness (what I call outer is a consciousness that witnesses the creation), then things take more or less time depending on the attention given it. And so everything, everything seems... nothing seems to be (what's the word?) absolute, in the sense of real – real, a concrete reality – nothing seems to be like that. Except unpleasant things in the body such as, for example, some functioning that goes wrong; that, you recognize as imperfection. The imperfection is what makes you feel the thing, otherwise it's like this (<em>same gesture of interiorization, curled up in the Lord</em>). And "like this," the Power is tremendous, in the sense that... for instance, for some people, a particular illness vanishes (without my doing anything outwardly in fact, without my even speaking to anyone, absolutely nothing – it's cured); for still another person... it's the end, he goes over to the other side. But then that other side has become both quite familiar to me and... totally unknown.</p>
<p class="P">I remember a time when the memory of past lives, the memory of night activities was so very concrete; the so-called invisible world was totally concrete – now... now everything is like a dream – everything – everything is like a dream veiling a Reality... an unknown Reality, and yet appreciable. I seem to be talking nonsense.</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, no, not at all!</em></p>
<p class="P">Because it can't be expressed.</p>
<p class="P">You asked me the other day (your question has stayed with me), you asked me: when I am silent and motionless like this, what is happening?... In point of fact it's an attempt (I can't say an aspiration, I can't say effort – the word in English is <em>urge</em>): the truth as it is. That's it. That's it. Not trying to know or understand it (it is</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 227</p>
<p class="P"> all one to me): to be – to be – to be.... And then.... (<em>Mother has a smile full of sweetness.</em>)</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Then curiously enough: at the same time – at the same time – not one in the other or one with the other, but one AND the other, at the same time (<em>Mother slips the fingers of her right hand between the fingers of her left</em>) it's marvelous and dreadful. Life as it is, as we feel it in our ordinary consciousness – as it is for men – seems something... but so dreadful that one wonders how it can be lived even a single minute; and the other, AT THE SAME TIME: a marvel. A marvel of light, consciousness, power – wondrous. And a power, a power!... And not the power of a particular person (<em>Mother pinches the skin of her hands</em>), it's something... it's something which is everything.... And you are left without words.</p>
<p class="P">So, quite naturally, the most interesting thing is to find That. Quite naturally, whenever I have nothing to do... (<em>gesture of interiorization, curled up in the Lord</em>). That's why I am forever asking you if you have questions or something, because there is no longer any "person" to be active, it's only the things which... (<em>gesture indicating the movements and vibrations of people or things triggering Mother's activity</em>). So when that's not there, it's... (<em>gesture in suspense, silence</em>).... Very far, far off... quite close, quite close to the other Consciousness, there are moments (<em>Mother speaks in a deep, solemn voice</em>): OM Namo Bhagavateh.... That's the most material thing. It's already... it seems so... <em>lifeless</em>. It gives the impression that a piece of wood might give us. And yet it's.... So at one and the same time one can be in a painful and incomprehensible and absurd life and absolutely at the same time... unutterably marvelous.</p>
<p class="P">So naturally I can't speak to anyone anymore, I can say it only to you, because people would think I am going nuts.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Only "You" – that's all.</p>

When the physical gets converted, it will be something SOLID, you know, unalterable – and complete. And so concrete.... The difference between being in the Divine, existing only by Him and for Him, and then being in the... not in the ordinary consciousness obviously, but just the human consciousness, is so great that the one seems like death compared to the other, it's so....

Whereas this is concrete (<em>Mother clenches her fists</em>). And so strong!</p>
<p class="P">Some problems are still to be solved, but not with words or thoughts.

And so the body is being accustomed to it. It's as if... you know, as if it suddenly caught a glimpse of such, such a marvelous horizon ahead, but overwhelmingly marvelous! Then, it is allowed to take only as much of it as it can bear.</p>

As Y.L. was a little taken aback, he added, "I went there before you, 33 years ago.... So I assume you know what they have been looking for in India...." Again a few days ago, Y.L. met André Malraux after his cry "Volunteer for Bengal"; he said to her, "What is essential in the fight I'm going to wage for Bengal is to know the attitude and action of Pondicherry." Y.L. therefore came to put the question directly to Mother. Mother asked, "When is André Malraux meeting Indira Gandhi?" "In November, in Paris." Mother again asked, "When is André Malraux thinking of coming to India?" "I don't know." Then Mother remained absorbed a long time and said, "He will only get THE answer when he arrives in India, because the answer is in him." After meeting Indira Gandhi in Paris, André Malraux will renounce his plan of action. Let us note that when Y.L. met him, he leafed through the Auroville pressbook and said, "All this is familiar – I'm part of it – I know this." And closing the book, "It's as if the sun had risen.

<p class="P"><em>Yes, I remember.</em></p>
<p class="P">I SAW it (<em>Mother touches her eyes</em>). I can't say I dreamed it: I SAW it. How did he do it? I don't know.</p>

<p class="P">The book must say when, no?</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, it doesn't say. Well, of course, I didn't read the whole book, but he doesn't say it in the preface.</em></p>
<p class="P">Anyway, the cosmic tradition is quite fantastic, but just the same there is something there.... You could have a look if you have time.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">You can see in the preface whether he says when Théon left.</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, I read the preface, but there's nothing about the passing of Théon. He says, "the Eastern Sage, Max Théon," that's all.</em></p>

<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Wouldn't things like that be useful either?</em></p>
<p class="P">That, yes. That could be useful.... But Théon couldn't even protect her! – She lost an eye in one of those experiences (I don't remember now).</p>

<p class="P">So, shall we send him something?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. He seems to be a good man from what I've seen. He was severely wounded in the first World War. And in his dedication (he wrote you a dedication), he asks you a question. He asks you for an answer. Here is what he says:</em></p>

<p class="P">Oh! Oh!... It's curious, it's just the experiences I am having now. That's rather strange. I just wanted to tell you about that today.</p>
<p class="P">The body is in a state in which it sees that everything depends only on... how it is tuned in to the Divine – on its state of receptive surrender. I had the experience again a few days ago (I told you the last time, but I had it again in a very precise way): the same thing that causes much more than a discomfort – a suffering, an almost unbearable condition – disappears immediately with just a change into a blissful state. I had the experience several times. And for me it is only a question of a certain sincerity having to do with intensity in the realization that everything is the work of the Divine and His action is moving towards the swiftest realization possible, given the present conditions. Something like that.</p>

<p class="P">I could say the cells of the body have to learn to seek their support ONLY in the Divine, until they are able to feel that they are the expression of the Divine. Is it clear?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, very clear.</em></p>
<p class="P">It is actually the experience I am having now. The experience (as I told you) of changing the consequences of things – I am having it. But it's not mentalized, so I can't put it into words. But the cells really have to become capable of feeling, first, that they are entirely controlled by the Divine (which is expressed by "What You want, what You want," that state), and then a sort of receptive... (what shall I say?) it's not immobile, it's.... Probably you would say a PASSIVE receptivity (<em>Mother opens her hands in a smile</em>). But I don't know how to explain it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother closes her eyes in a smile</em>)</p>
<p class="P">All words are false, but you could say: "You alone exist." You know, what the cells feel: "You alone exist." Like that. But all that becomes hard – words harden the experience. It's a kind of plasticity or suppleness, very trusting): what You want, what You want....</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Will you take care of an answer to that man?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, certainly, Mother. What about sending him a "blessing packet" as a support to your words?</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother gives a packet</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 268</p>
<p class="P">You know, the "Cosmic" had a very interesting effect in my life. I was completely against "God." The European notion of God was quite repulsive to me. But at the same time naturally, that prevented me from having any experience. And with the "cosmic teaching" of the inner god (that was Théon's idea, the inner god – <em>Mother touches her chest</em> – the one that is inside each of us), brff! (<em>gesture as if walls were crumbling</em>). The experience was fantastic. I am very grateful to him. That's how it happened; I found it by following his instructions and searching within, behind the solar plexus. I found it, I had an experience... an absolutely convincing experience.</p>
<p class="P">Only people will stumble upon some vital force and mistake it for the soul, so.... You have to be VERY sincere, that is the absolute condition. You have to be VERY sincere, VERY sincere – not only must you not deceive others, but you must not deceive yourself. You have to be VERY sincere. And then you find it. You find it, it's an absolutely concrete experience.</p>
<p class="P">I had the experience before coming here. Before I came, before knowing Sri Aurobindo, I had the experience. So three quarters of the work was already done, you could say.... I didn't have mental knowledge (the mental knowledge was nothing to talk about), but it's not necessary for the experience. If you're sincere, you have the experience without thinking, you don't NEED to think. But you have to be sincere.</p>
<p class="P">And now that's what my body has, it's having those same experiences. But words are....</p>
<p class="P">In a certain attitude (but it's difficult to explain or define), in a certain attitude, everything becomes divine. Everything. And what is marvelous then is that when you have the experience that everything becomes divine, everything that is contrary quite simply disappears (fast or slow, right away or little by little, depending on circumstances).</p>
<p class="P">That's really marvelous. That is to say, becoming conscious that everything is divine is the best way to make everything divine – you understand – to eliminate all opposition.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes within</em>)</p>

<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">We could say that the cure for all physical disorders lies in the cells becoming convinced – conscious and convinced – that they are an expression of the Divine, or even that they are divine in their essence.</p>
<p class="P">Just last night, I stayed for hours.... (nowadays I sleep very, very, very little, I spend hours in a kind of state that is not sleep and not activity, it's something rather new), and in that state the body became conscious that it was nothing, that it knew nothing, that it could do nothing, that it... a kind of almost total nullity. It had that for hours. And then slowly that feeling changed... it changed into a... something like a sensation (it's not an ordinary sensation, but it's something similar to a sensation); the "nothing" – the nothingness, the total nullity – began to feel that it existed only THROUGH the Divine; and then gradually, FOR the Divine, and... a kind of peace settled in... (<em>Mother closes her eyes with a smile... then she opens her eyes wide</em>), an all-powerful peace.</p>
<p class="P">And everything that was painful disappeared.</p>
<p class="P">Peace....</p>
<p class="P">Only, the body [Mother's body] has an advantage in life: it was built and conceived in such a way that it does not desire pleasant sensations. It does not desire (what shall I say?), yes, the sensation of pleasure, pleasant things, it is quite indifferent to them – and spontaneously. It took no effort to overcome its desires, it never cared about them. It only protested against pain, but that is disappearing totally.</p>
<p class="P">Now, I think the bodily ego is in the process of disappearing. Then it will be perfect.</p>
<p class="P">It's really quite spontaneous – spontaneous and sincere: You, You, You.... What You want, what You want.... what You want.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Letter from Sri Aurobindo to C.R. Das, his lawyer in the Alipore bomb case.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align: right;">18 November 1922</p>
<p class="P">Dear Chitta,</p>
<p class="P">It is a long time, almost two years I think, since I have written a letter to anyone. I have been so much retired and absorbed in my Sadhana that contact with the outside world has till lately been reduced to minimum.</p>
<p class="P">... I have become confirmed in a perception which I had always, less clearly and dynamically then, but which has now become more and more evident to me, that the true basis of work and life is the spiritual, – that is to say, a new consciousness to be developed only by Yoga. I see more and more manifestly that man can never get out of the futile circle the race is always treading until he has raised himself on to the new foundation. I believe also that it is the mission of India to make this great victory for the world. But what precisely was the nature of the dynamic power of this greater consciousness? What was the condition of its effective truth? How could it be brought down, mobilised, organised, turned upon life? How could our present instruments, intellect, mind, life, body be made true and perfect channels for this great transformation? This was the problem I have been trying to work out in my own experience and I have now a sure basis, a wide knowledge and some mastery of the secret. Not yet its fulness and complete imperative presence – therefore I have still to remain in retirement. For I am determined not to work in the external field till I have the sure and complete possession of this new power of action, – not to build except on a perfect foundation.</p>
<p class="P">But still I have gone far enough to be able to undertake one work on a larger scale than before – the training of others to receive this Sadhana and prepare themselves as I have done, for without that my future work cannot even be begun. There are many who desire to come here and whom I can admit for the purpose, there are a greater number who can be trained at a distance; but I am unable to carry on unless I have sufficient funds to be able to maintain a centre here and one or two at least outside. I need therefore much larger resources than I at present command.</p>

<p class="P" style="text-align: right;">18 November 1922</p>
<p class="P">Dear Barin,</p>
<p class="P">... I have been till now and shall be for some time longer withdrawn in the practice of a Yoga destined to be a basis not for withdrawal from life, but for the transformation of human life. It is a Yoga in which vast untried tracts of inner experience and new paths of Sadhana had to be opened up and which, therefore, needed retirement and long time for its completion. But the time is approaching, though it has not yet come, when I shall have to take up a large external work proceeding from the spiritual basis of this Yoga.</p>
<p class="P">It is, therefore, necessary to establish a number of centres small and few at first but enlarging and increasing in number as I go on, for training in this Sadhana.... The first, which will be transferred to British India when I go there, already exists at Pondicherry, but I need funds both to maintain and to enlarge it....</p>
<p class="P">Many more desire and are fit to undertake this Sadhana than I can at present admit and it is only by large means being placed at my disposal that I can carry on this work which is necessary as a preparation for my own return to action....</p>

<p class="P">Dear Barin,</p>
<p class="P">I must now make clear the reasons why I hesitated to sanction the publication [of certain texts].... But that about non-cooperation would lead, I think, to a complete misunderstanding</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 274</p>
<p class="P"> of my real position. Some would take it to mean that I accept the Gandhi programme.... As you know, I do not believe that the Mahatma's principle can be the true foundation or his programme the true means of bringing out the genuine freedom and greatness of India.... My own policy, if I were in the field, would be radically different in principle and programme.... But the country is not yet ready to understand its principle or to execute its programme.</p>
<p class="P">Because I know this very well, I am content to work still on the spiritual and psychic plane, preparing there the ideas and forces, which may afterwards at the right moment and under the right conditions precipitate themselves into the vital and material field, and I have been careful not to make any public pronouncement as that might prejudice my possibilities of future action. What that will be will depend on developments. The present trend of politics may end in abortive unrest, but it may also stumble with the aid of external circumstances into some kind of simulacrum of self-government. In either case the whole real work will remain to be done. I wish to keep myself free for it in either case....</p>

<p class="P">Supreme Peace is established and becomes constant, and then....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Then the functioning of the body can change.</em></p>
<p class="P">And certitude in the action also. A certitude in the action when you do things.</p>
<p class="P">That's all?</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's very difficult to know what to do.... You get the feeling there's a Silence, that nothing responds – nothing tells you: "Do this or do that." So you wonder if that silence means you should simply remain inactive and still, or if you should undertake a positive act, "pull" something and act.</em></p>
<p class="P">It depends on the case. There's a slight difference.... There are cases when nothing comes – nothing, everything is stopped. So there you have to wait until it runs its course. There are cases where you are NATURALLY led to do one thing or another, which seems totally indifferent but is part of the Action (I don't know how to say it). I have experienced both. It depends on the case. There are cases where nothing is needed. There are cases where it's simply as though you put the Divine ON the thing (<em>Mother makes a gesture of aiming a beam</em>). You know, you're like... not an intermediary, I don't know... it's like a power of concentration on something; then the Divine Force flows through and is focused (<em>same gesture of aiming a beam</em>), but you yourself do nothing – yet the thing is done. Sometimes, if there is a word to be said, then the word comes to you; or if there is something to be done (it may seem like a very small, indifferent thing), you just have to do it quietly – you are LED to do it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>You're led, yes, I understand....</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence,<br/>
torrential rain</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because, my own fear is that I am divided between the idea that I must do something and the idea that if there is really something to be done, inevitably the Divine will make me do it.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 276</p>
<p class="P"><em> But then, you wonder whether that's inactivity, passivity [or even somnolence], or whether you should do something – that's the only thing.</em></p>
<p class="P">No, there is a moment when it becomes clear. It all depends on.... All personal preferences and desires must disappear.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, that's it.</em></p>
<p class="P">Then, in that case, it becomes very clear. There are times when you're sort of COMPELLED to do something. There are times when... nothing – you feel the Force passing and having an effect, but you yourself (I mean, the body), the body doesn't move. It becomes very perceptible. And I've had proof that that's right, because I've had examples: at times, when I've remained still like that, without saying anything, simply letting the Force be focused on someone or something through the body (<em>same gesture of aiming a beam</em>), it does it, it acts miraculously like that. And the body has done nothing, hasn't moved, just let it pass through and be focused on a particular spot (<em>same gesture</em>). It's automatically focused. Because it's in our consciousness that the world is divided like this (<em>gesture of little pieces</em>), and there's one person, another person, one thing, another thing – it's our consciousness which is like that; so "one" uses that [the individuality] as a channel for the Force to go exactly where it is supposed to go. The action is not a personal action: it's an Action of the Force using the personal consciousness as a pipe – you understand?</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's very difficult to say that one no longer has any preferences and desires....</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because it's so subtle!</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh!... But that's progressive, you see; you can go on working at it all the time, all the time, all the time.... It's my constant occupation: eliminating all preferences. But the positive means is (we always come back to the same thing): "What You want, what You want.... What You want, what You want...." And when you're completely still and free from any trepidation (what I call "passive receptivity," that is, there isn't any activity, and yet: what You want, what You want...), then – then only – That works. And you</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 277</p>
<p class="P"> really have the feeling (I don't know how to say it), really that you're used only as a channel so the Thing – the Force or the Action – can go exactly where it is supposed to go. That's what our consciousness is used for (<em>gesture of a pipe</em>).</p>

Now to restore the momentum, the people of "Pathmandir"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="78-2" href="#">2</a> have to do something. But the people of Pathmandir have another idea.

<p class="P">Yes, but if they are likely to damage it or.... That should be absolutely avoided.... I don't know, they're mad there – they're mad everywhere. They're mad here too.</p>
<p class="P">Here too, it came here, the same idea of killing, destroying.... It's everywhere. It's as if the whole vital world had descended on earth (<em>gesture of a crushing mass</em>).</p>
<p class="P">I wouldn't want anything to happen to the statue.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, but in my opinion, the statue loses its meaning if it isn't in public. If it's put in a house, it loses its meaning.</em></p>

I was made to live all the possible things that could still happen to me, to the body, if things went wrong and precisely if men were driven by the adverse force.

<p class="P">My card is there – nothing much. I don't even know what I wrote you.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Shall I look? [Satprem opens the card.] You said, "With my affection and blessings."</em></p>
<p class="P">Just that. It's better than a lot of words. I don't like big words.</p>
<p class="P">I have but one thing to tell you: I need you. There! (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, Mother, I wish I could serve you better.... It's a grace to work for you.</em></p>
<p class="P">But I am so happy with your work! It's so helpful to me, you know – just the way I want it to be. Exactly. Not once have I thought: Well, he could do this, he could do that – no, it's just the way I want.</p>
<p class="P">Mon petit....</p>
<p class="P">So what do you have to tell me?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I don't know....</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 286</p>
<p class="P">There's nothing?</p>

<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes within for a long time, then a smile spreads over her lips</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I have a sort of impression of knowing the why of the creation.</p>
<p class="P">It was to realize the phenomenon of a consciousness which would have at once an individual consciousness – the individual consciousness we have naturally – and a consciousness of the whole, a consciousness (how to put it?)... it could be called global. But both consciousnesses merge into something... which we have yet to find.</p>
<p class="P">A consciousness at once individual and total. And all the work is to merge the two consciousnesses in a consciousness which is both at once. That is the next realization.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">For us it takes time (what is translated for us as time), as if it were something "being done," or which is "to be done." But that is the illusion we're still in. Because we have not... we have not yet crossed over to the other side.</p>
<p class="P">But the individual consciousness is not at all a falsehood, it has to be associated with the consciousness of the whole so as to make another kind of consciousness which at the moment we still don't have. Not that it will cancel out the other, you understand? There has to be an adjustment, a different aspect, I don't know... so that the two can manifest simultaneously.</p>
<p class="P">For example, right now I am having a whole series of experiences concerning the latent power of creation of the individual consciousness, I mean the capacity we have of knowing things – knowing or wanting them, as we say – in the individual consciousness before they take place. We say "I want this," but that's merely an intermediary device, it's actually the consciousness on the way to something and having at once the vision of what is to be and the capacity to realize it.</p>
<p class="P">That's the next stage. Afterwards....</p>
<p class="P">So, for us, meaning for the individual consciousness, that is translated by time, the time it takes to.... I don't know how to say it.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 287</p>
<p class="P">This is the way I feel: no longer this, not yet that; and there's no need to leave one to be the other – the two must combine and give birth to something new.</p>

<p class="P">I have a very strong feeling I have caught the true thing, as if I held (<em>Mother clenches her fist</em>) the tail of the true thing. And it explains everything – absolutely everything. And it cancels nothing.</p>

<p class="P">It's strange how everything suddenly became clear, clear, clear.... There's no longer any problem.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes back within in a smile</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You have nothing to tell me?</p>
<p class="P"><em>So I shouldn't worry?</em></p>
<p class="P">No. No, no! If you knew how marvelous it is! Absolutely all the problems have been solved all at once. Only, I can't talk about it.</p>
<p class="P">Don't worry.</p>
<p class="P">It's a hundred times more marvelous than we can possibly imagine.</p>
<p class="P">The question is to know if this [the body] will be able to follow.... To follow, it not only has to last, but it has to acquire a new strength and a new life. That I don't know. In any case, it doesn't matter – the consciousness is clear, and the consciousness is not subject to this (<em>Mother points to her body</em>). If it can be used, so much the better, if not.... There are still things to be found.</p>
<p class="P">Oh, many things to be found! The old routine is over.</p>
<p class="P">It's over.</p>
<p class="P">We need to find the plasticity of matter – so that matter can progress forever. That's it.<br/>
How much time will it take? I don't know. How many experiences will it take? I don't know. But now the direction is clear. The direction is clear.</p>
<p class="P">Mon petit, you've given me the most marvelous gift today that anyone could give!</p>

<p class="P"><em>An Auroville story.</em></p>
<p class="P">Auroville? What happened?</p>
<p class="P"><em>A few days ago I received a letter from a young man who is an architect there, Z (I don't know him). He wrote me saying that he would like to see me.</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah, why?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because he would like to explain to me Auroville's problems. So I replied: "Auroville's problems will be solved and cleared up only when Aurovillians turn directly to Mother, and hence I wish they would go directly to the Source instead of going to an intermediary." Then I added amicably that I could nevertheless... etc.</em></p>
<p class="P">You did well.</p>
<p class="P">He has an idea of how to make the Matrimandir, and others have another idea, but then R. [the architect] is going to arrive soon – I would like to wait for R. to be here, and he will decide.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because he wrote me a second letter, saying, "I agree that one must turn to the Source, which is the 'stable and welcoming' reference, but unfortunately one doesn't have direct access to the Source, one has to go through intermediaries...."</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother nods her head</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 292</p>
<p class="P"><em>So there are some problems, and he has explained one of them in his letter to me.</em></p>
<p class="P">Tell me what it is.</p>
<p class="P"><em>For example, he says he wrote you a month ago, in October, and you answered him in writing. He wrote you this: "I have made a detailed study of the work to be done, and I have reached the conclusion that we [Aurovillians] can take upon ourselves the responsibility for the excavation and construction work of the four pillars; then a commercial firm such as EEC [I don't know what it is, it's in Madras, I think] would agree to take over the construction of the Matrimandir itself ..., etc. It therefore appears that the work of the Aurovillians is not an obstacle to the rest of the work being handled by a specialized firm...." Then you answered, "That's very good, I am fully in agreement. The safety and solidity of the work should come BEFORE PERSONAL QUESTIONS. I am counting on you to see that everything goes harmoniously."</em></p>
<p class="P">And then I realized.... Afterwards, the others told me that he had written that without consulting them.</p>
<p class="P"><em>And he tells me he did it "after consultation with about 50 Aurovillians."</em></p>
<p class="P">No.... Listen, those things are enough to drive anyone crazy!</p>
<p class="P"><em>In a nutshell he wants the work to be handled by the Aurovillians, without barring the participation of experts.</em></p>
<p class="P">But that's how it is. It will be that way. That's what I said; but when it comes to the actual execution.... I advise you not to get involved in this!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, but I don't intend to at all!</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, they're.... It's pretty complicated!</p>
<p class="P"><em>I'll simply tell him to wait for R.'s return and that the decision will be made then.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 293</p>
<p class="P">Yes. But the decision has been made – I don't know, I thought they were already working.</p>
<p class="P"><em>The "official" decision is that a firm in Madras will do the work.</em></p>
<p class="P">Not all the work. We have asked the Aurovillians to be there – exactly as he puts it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, because he says he is ready even to undertake the foundation work for the pillars.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, no! That's.... Look, tell him that R. will soon arrive and everything will be decided when he's here.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But I really don't want to get involved in their problems!</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, no!... Did you see the sentence in my letter – there are also personal questions behind. He is not saying it, but that's what it is. He's hoping to find someone (Satprem) who will give him the authority, you understand?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, I think he is.</em></p>
<p class="P">So just tell him what I said.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>

<p class="P"><em>Either from Auroville or the Ashram, or French or Germans.... I have seen lots of them – anyone who came to the tennis court could see me. I did that for several years. And then I don't know, all of a sudden I completely stopped. I said I wouldn't see anyone anymore.... I don't know if I was right. Because sometimes, I feel it would perhaps be good, it might help people, but on the other hand I have the feeling that... it's not the solution.</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>Really?...</em></p>

<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">There was a sentence in one of my "Notes,"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="84" href="#">3</a> I was wondering if it should be left in.</p>
<p class="P"><em>What sentence?</em></p>
<p class="P">I don't remember now.... It's the sentence where I speak of the Power.</p>
<p class="P"><em>... becoming overwhelming?</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes. And then I gave two examples.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, curing people and going over to the other side.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but then regarding going over to the other side, I wondered if people weren't going to think that I purposely killed people! – It would be better perhaps not to put it.</p>

<p class="P"><em>!!!</em></p>
<p class="P">Or is it clear?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Obviously, one can deduce anything, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes. But since people are so ill-disposed....</p>
<p class="P"><em>But then one would have to stop talking altogether.</em></p>
<p class="P">There's also a sentence by Sri Aurobindo which I always remember, where he said, "When God... (these are not the exact words) when God bids you to kill, you must kill."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">4</a></p>
<p class="P"><em>That can be wrongly interpreted too.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, I should think so!</p>
<p class="P"><em>But then everything can be twisted, everything!</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, let's just leave it [Mother's sentence], never mind....</p>
<p class="P">A word or two would be enough to say "those who want to leave" – that it's the choice of the one who leaves. That's all. That indication would be enough.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I can see at the Press if it isn't too late.</em></p>
<p class="P">Just add a word like that. It's rather "to help them leave" than "against their will" (!).</p>
<p class="P">As you say, one with a straight mind will understand, but.... Only the twisted ones – and you can't do anything about that, they'll always do it. But it's better not to give them too many opportunities.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">There's something interesting, I don't know if you know this. The government of Orissa before was completely for Sri Aurobindo, and they were very faithful. Then there was a terrible cyclone that came straight at them, but it was deflected, went to Bengal [East-Pakistan] instead and killed an enormous number of people (that</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 297</p>
<p class="P"> was last year, I think).<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86" href="#">5</a> Then, the government of Orissa changed. They've become aggressive, dark, just the opposite. They've turned against Sri Aurobindo. And this time, a few days ago, the cyclone struck and did terrible damage....</p>
<p class="P">Some have understood.</p>
<p class="P">On the other hand, naturally, some say, "How come? Last time you protected us and this time..." – they don't understand. But those who understand have very clearly seen the difference.</p>
<p class="P">There are interesting things. But you have the feeling of being, you know (<em>gesture of instability</em>), on the edge of a cliff – you mustn't make a single false step.</p>
<p class="P">As if the Consciousness were putting pressure on circumstances so they become more definite and clear. Only, then, it's the end of peace and tranquility.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">But also, under that pressure, the consciousness [Mother's physical consciousness] is becoming clearer and clearer, and realizes how much work we have to do for everything in the being to be in tune with the Divine alone, oh!...

<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I don't know how to explain it.... The ordinary human consciousness, even in people who are broad-minded and all that, is always at the center, and things are like this (<em>gesture converging from all sides toward a center</em>), you understand.

<img alt="Agenda Image" class="cover-image" src="static/HTML/Agenda_12_images/img643.jpg"/>
<p class="P">Yes, that's what expresses it the best, I think: in the ordinary human consciousness, you're at one point and everything exists in its relation to that point of consciousness (<em>same star-shaped gesture</em>). While now, the point no longer exists, so things are selfexistent. The point is no longer the source. That's the closest (that's not it, but...). You see, my consciousness is IN things – it isn't "something that receives" (it's much better than that, but I don't know how to put it into words).</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 301</p>
<p class="P">It's better than that because it isn't just "in things": it's in "something" which is in things and which... moves them.</p>
<p class="P">I could be flowery; I could say (but that's not it): it's no longer one being among other beings, it's... it's the Divine in everything. But that's not the way I feel it. It's what moves things or what is conscious in things. "What is conscious".... It isn't exactly "governs" because the word "govern" doesn't convey the right sense – "animates" (not that either, all those words reduce and materialize the experience).</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>

<p class="P">I can't say, but the fact is like this: in the new consciousness, I eat very easily, without noticing it, and everything goes very well; as soon as I become conscious in the old consciousness, which means eating, tasting the food, putting it in my mouth – it's difficult! I have all the trouble in the world not to swallow wrong.</p>
<p class="P">It's really something new because I don't know how to describe it.</p>
<p class="P">But then it's extremely concrete: when I am in that consciousness, my whole lunch is taken effortlessly, without any difficulty; I am given food, I swallow and I don't notice... not that I don't notice it (I have taste, I have everything), but the position is different.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, at that moment it's part of the universal movement.</em></p>
<p class="P">No, it's something which is at once in me and IN THE FOOD, which tastes and takes, but is no longer... it's no longer the way it was before, that's all I can say.</p>
<p class="P">It's really new.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 302</p>
<p class="P">And it's particularly noticeable for food, because when I am in that consciousness – which comes as soon as I don't do anything, as soon as I sit quietly – it isn't like something that "comes in" (<em>gesture toward a center</em>), it's like something (<em>expanding gesture</em>)... which develops, which is free to develop. Well then – then it's very good. But if I am in the ordinary consciousness and I eat (it's "time" for a meal), oh, it's so difficult that I feel it's going to be impossible to eat anything! And in the other case, it goes down without my even noticing it. And yet I am conscious of what I am eating.</p>
<p class="P">But what I am saying now isn't it. It's something else.... You see, the consciousness is still like this (<em>gesture of oscillating from one side to the other</em>). Both are there. So.... But then I can't find a way to make myself understood, because new words would have to be invented.</p>
<p class="P">That's increasing from day to day.</p>
<p class="P">It's like at night: I don't sleep and I am not awake; I go into a state in which I don't sleep at all – yet I am not awake. And I don't know how to describe what it is. And when it's normal, it could... it can last indefinitely, there's no sense of time or fatigue or duration. When the old consciousness comes back, there's almost unbearable suffering: I am suffocating or I can't breathe, or it's a consciousness which shouldn't be there anymore. So quite naturally and effortlessly, I am in the new state, but if I am drawn into the old consciousness by circumstances, it becomes almost unbearable. You see. And it results in pains in the body or... a body malfunction. But when I enter the new consciousness, everything takes place quite... without my even noticing it and without any effort.</p>
<p class="P">That's all I can say for the moment.</p>
<p class="P">You see, my body is full of pains and malfunctions, but as soon as I go into that state (<em>vast, peaceful gesture</em>) everything is done – time doesn't exist anymore. Time is endless in the old consciousness, while it doesn't exist in this one. I don't know how to describe it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Being flowery, I would say: the old consciousness is like... it's death, it's as if you were going to die any minute: you suffer, you... it's the consciousness that leads to death. And the other one (<em>vast, immutable, smiling gesture</em>) is life... peaceful life, eternal life. Yes, that's it.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Mother tries vainly to remember. Then Satprem goes on to read several letters by Sri Aurobindo, and in particular this one, addressed to a Muslim disciple who wanted to leave the Ashram to practice his religion exclusively, taking with him and against their will his young brother, X, and his sister, Y.</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"...As for X and Y, you have no claim over them and no right to control their thoughts and actions. X is of an age to choose and decide; he can think and act for himself and has no need of you to think and act for him. You are not his guardian, nor Y's; you are not even the head of the family. On what ground do you claim to decide where he shall go or where he shall stay? Your pretension to have the responsibility for him or her before God is an arrogant and grotesque absurdity. Each one is responsible for himself before God unless he freely chooses to place the responsibility upon another in whom he trusts. No one has the right to impose himself on others as a religious or spiritual guide against their free will. You have no claim at all to dictate to X or Y either in their inner or their outer life. It is again the confusion and incoherence of your mind in its present state that prevents you from recognising these plain and simple facts.</p>
<p class="P">"Again, you say that you ask only for the Truth and yet you speak like a narrow and ignorant fanatic who refuses to believe in anything but the religion in which he was born. All fanaticism is false, because it is a contradiction of the very nature of God and of Truth. Truth cannot be shut up in a single book, Bible or Veda or Koran, or in a single religion. The Divine Being is eternal and universal and infinite and cannot be the sole property of the Mussulmans or of the Semitic religions only, – those that happened to be in a line from the Bible and to have Jewish or Arabian prophets for their founders. Hindus and Confucians and Taoists and all others have as much right to enter into relation with God and find the Truth in their own way. All religions have some truth in them, but none has the whole truth; all are created in time and finally decline and perish. Mahomed himself never pretended that the Koran was the last message of God and there would be no other.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 307</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"> God and Truth outlast these religions and manifest themselves anew in whatever way or form the Divine Wisdom chooses. You cannot shut up God in the limitations of your own narrow brain or dictate to the Divine Power and Consciousness how or where or through whom it shall manifest; you cannot put up your puny barriers against the divine Omnipotence. These again are simple truths which are now being recognised all over the world; only the childish in mind or those who vegetate in some formula of the past deny them.</p>
<p class="P">"You have insisted on my writing and asked for the Truth and I have answered. But if you want to be a Mussulman, no one prevents you. If the Truth I bring is too great for you to understand or to bear, you are free to go and live in a half-truth or in your own ignorance. I am not here to convert anyone; I do not preach to the world to come to me and I call no one. I am here to establish the divine life and the divine consciousness in those who of themselves feel the call to come to me and cleave to it and in no others. I am not asking you and the Mother is not asking you to accept us. You can go any day and live either the worldly life or a religious life according to your own preference. But as you are free, so also are others free to stay here and follow their own way...."</p>

<p class="P"><em>Nothing new on your part?</em></p>
<p class="P">I am becoming a new person.... But....</p>
<p class="P">It's interesting.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes within</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You see, I am witnessing nature's transformation. When I have nothing to do and I sit very quiet, it's very clear. I see three things: the nature being transformed, or rather the new nature, what we can call the supramental way of seeing things (it's getting clearer and clearer; the memory of the old nature remains but is fading more and more, to such a point that sometimes it's almost incredible, it seems fantastic to have been like that). Then there's the physical deterioration that comes with age: for example, the physical inability to do what I used to do, the body getting old. But the aging is PURELY physical, I mean, I sit here all day long and have trouble moving about, things like that, but from the standpoint of perception, consciousness, there's no diminution. On the contrary, it's getting clearer and clearer and more and more precise. But, for instance, I have trouble speaking (<em>Mother touches her chest, she is out of breath</em>), it's hard for me to speak; I can't speak easily, it's hard. Things like that. That makes three things.</p>
<p class="P">But when I am very quiet (at night, for instance), the new consciousness becomes clearer and clearer, but words cannot easily express it because... it's a kind of... (how shall I say?) it's almost as if a new mind were being formed (but not a mental one). And so speech, words... are a poor means, while the direct communication is getting more and more precise and strong. That's why I can't speak. It's purely physical. But the foundation of the physical poise, I mean the physical health, is changing, that is, it's being shifted: what used to be the condition of good health is practically gone; it is gradually replaced by another condition, but which isn't there yet; so everything is in... (<em>gesture of instability</em>), everything is no longer this, is not yet that. That's how it is. It's inexpressible. That's why I can't express myself.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 316</p>
<p class="P">Interestingly enough, I notice it in my way of understanding things. For instance, what Sri Aurobindo wrote is VERY different.... It's a little as if, before, you used to see through a screen and, now, the screen is being lifted – it's not completely gone yet, but it's not completely there either.</p>
<p class="P">But, as you see, speaking makes me short of breath – without reason, simply because... because it's not natural anymore.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">And then, the way of perceiving time and space is becoming very different. It's completely changing. The notion of time and space, objectivity and subjectivity – whether things are concrete or not – all that seems to have been... <em>devices</em> for preparing the consciousness for a new way of being.</p>
<p class="P">The functioning of the consciousness is beginning to be different. But I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">And then, for sight, for instance, sometimes I see more clearly with my eyes closed than with them open, and the vision is the SAME, physical, purely physical vision; but a physical that seems... more complete, I don't know what words to use. For instance, when I write; sometimes with my eyes closed I see what I write or see the same thing, but I see it... (what shall I say?... I could be wordy, but I don't like that). You know, it's as if what you see were more complete, yet it's the same thing, but containing more than the purely physical vision.</p>
<p class="P">I write <em>birthday</em> cards, and Sri Aurobindo.... I was about to say I have the feeling that Sri Aurobindo makes me write, but it's not like that, it's much better than that!... But when I start to write, for example, I close my eyes, and I see better what I am writing. Champaklal asks me to sign the cards, and he tells me that I sometimes write 3 or 4 cards in a row with my eyes completely closed, then my handwriting is much straighter and much more where the writing should be.</p>
<p class="P">But there's no personal will involved, no personal effort, it's... it's spontaneous. So....</p>
<p class="P">And then, there is a kind of "something" that has been formed in the body to replace the mind, which is gone. This "something" has its mental ways of saying things, but it's very imperfect. For it,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 317</p>
<p class="P"> mental perceptions seem so thin, like a husk, the husk of something – so dry, with no real life behind them.</p>
<p class="P">But the main trouble is in speaking (<em>Mother touches her chest</em>). I don't know, I have the same trouble eating. I don't think it's the result of age because I feel strong: I feel strength, it's not that I am tired, I don't at all feel tired – it's... a change. But then my age gives it a semblance of reason. Well (<em>laughing</em>) I don't know if it was these last few days (yesterday or the day before), all of a sudden I understood, as if Sri Aurobindo made me understand that it has come at this advanced age to give the semblance of reason, in order to... to assure me the utmost peace possible in my relations with people.</p>
<p class="P">I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="P">Things are essentially what they are supposed to be, but the problem is this human consciousness, which is so... (what's the word?), so thin: it lacks something, which prevents us from seeing things as they really are, or feeling them as they really are.</p>
<p class="P">As for hearing, I've noticed one thing: for instance, someone may tell me something in a very loud voice, making a lot of noise – I understand NOTHING; while other times, a noise that others don't hear I hear very clearly....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="90" href="#">1</a> I need a certain CONSCIOUS atmosphere in order to hear, and that atmosphere is not perceived by most people.</p>

<p class="P">"The world situation is critical today. India's fate too is hanging in the balance. There was a time when India was a absolutely secure, there was no danger whatever of her being victim to Asuric aggression. But things have changed. People and forces in India have acted in such a way as to invite Asuric influences upon her: these have worked insidiously and undermined the security that was there.</p>
<p class="P">"If India is in danger, Pondicherry cannot be expected to remain outside the danger zone. It will share the fate of the rest of the country. The protection I can give is not unconditional. It is idle to hope that in spite of anything and everything, the protection will be there over all. My protection is there if conditions are fulfilled. It goes without saying that any sympathy or support for the Nazis (or for any ally of theirs) automatically cuts across the circle of protection. Apart from this obvious and external factor, there are more fundamental psychological conditions which demand fulfillment. The Divine can give protection only to those who are whole-heartedly faithful to the Divine, who live truly in the spirit of sadhana and keep their consciousness and preoccupation fixed upon the Divine and the service of the Divine. Desire, for example, insistence on one's likes and conveniences, all movements of hypocrisy and insincerity and falsehood, are great obstacles standing in the way of the Divine's protection. If you seek to impose your will upon the Divine, it is as if you were calling for a bomb to fall upon you. I do not say that things are bound to happen in this way; but they are very likely to happen, if people do not become conscious and strictly vigilant and act in the true spirit of a spiritual seeker. If the psychological atmosphere remains the same as that of the outside world, there can be no wall of security against the dark Forces that are working out in it the ordeal of danger, suffering and destruction entering here."</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 327</p>
<p class="Ps">SRI AUROBINDO AND THE EARTH'S FUTURE</p>
<p class="P">Sometimes a great wandering Thought sees the ages still unaccomplished, seizes the Force in its eternal flow and precipitates upon earth the powerful vision, which is like a power of realizing what it sees. The world is a vision becoming real. Indeed its past and its present are not the result of an obscure impulse coming from the womb of time, of a slow accumulation of sediments which little by little mold us – and stifle us and imprison us. It is the powerful golden attraction of the future which draws us in spite of ourselves, as the sun draws the lotus from the mud, and forces us to a glory greater than any our mud or efforts or present triumphs could have foreseen or created.</p>
<p class="P">Sri Aurobindo is this vision and this power of precipitating the future into the present. What he saw in an instant the ages and millions of men will unwittingly accomplish. Unknowingly they will seek the new imperceptible quiver that has entered the earth's atmosphere. From age to age great beings come amongst us to hew a great opening of Truth in the sepulchre of the past. And in actuality, these beings are the great destroyers of the past. They come with the sword of Knowledge to shatter our fragile empires.</p>
<p class="P">This year, we are celebrating Sri Aurobindo's Birth Centenary. He is known to barely a handful of men and yet his name will resound when the great men of today or yesterday are buried under their own debris. His work is discussed by philosophers, praised by poets, people acclaim his sociological vision and his yoga – but Sri Aurobindo is a living ACTION, a Word becoming real, and every day in the thousand circumstances that seem to want to rend the earth and topple its structures we can witness the first reflux of the Force he has set in motion. At the beginning of this century, when India was still struggling against British domination, Sri Aurobindo asserted: "It is not a revolt against the British Government [that is needed].... It is, in fact, a revolt against the whole universal Nature."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="93" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P">For the problem is fundamental. It is not a question of bringing a new philosophy to the world or new ideas or illuminations, as they are called. The question is not of making the Prison of our lives more habitable, or of endowing man with ever more fantastic powers. Armed with his microscopes and telescopes, the human</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 328</p>
<p class="P"> gnome remains a gnome, pain-ridden and helpless. We send rockets to the moon, but we know nothing of our own hearts. It is a question, says Sri Aurobindo, "of creating a new physical nature which is to be the habitation of the Supramental being in a new evolution."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="94" href="#">3</a> For, in actuality, he says, "the imperfection of Man is not the last word of Nature, but his perfection too is not the last peak of the Spirit."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">4</a> Beyond the mental man we are, there exists the possibility of another being who will be the spearhead of evolution as man was once the spearhead of evolution among the great apes. "If," says Sri Aurobindo, "the animal is a living laboratory in which Nature has, it is said, worked out man, man himself may well be a thinking and living laboratory in whom and with whose conscious co-operation she wills to work out the superman, the god."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="96" href="#">5</a> Sri Aurobindo has come to tell us how to create this other being, this supramental being, and not only to tell us but actually to create this other being and open the path of the future, to hasten upon earth the rhythm of evolution, the new vibration that will replace the mental vibration – exactly as a thought one day disturbed the slow routine of the beasts – and will give us the power to shatter the walls of our human prison.</p>
<p class="P">Indeed, the prison is already starting to collapse. "The end of a stage of evolution," announced by Sri Aurobindo, "is usually marked by a powerful recrudescence of all that has to go out of the evolution."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">6</a> Everywhere about us we see this paroxysmal shattering of all the old forms: our borders, our churches, our laws, our morals are collapsing on all sides. They are not collapsing because we are bad, immoral, irreligious, or because we are not sufficiently rational, scientific or human, but because we have come to the end of the human! To the end of the old mechanism – for we are on our way to SOMETHING ELSE. The world is not going through a moral crisis but through an "evolutionary crisis." We are not going towards a better world – nor, for that matter, towards a worse one – we are in the midst of a MUTATION to a radically different world, as different as the human world was from the ape world of the Tertiary Era. We are entering a new era, a supramental Quinary. We leave our countries, wander aimlessly, we go looking for drugs, for adventure, we go on strike here, enact reforms there, foment revolutions and counterrevolutions. But all</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 329</p>
<p class="P"> this is only an appearance; in fact, unwittingly, we are looking for the new being. We are in the midst of human evolution.</p>
<p class="P">And Sri Aurobindo gives us the key. It may be that the sense of our own revolution escapes us because we try to prolong that which already exists, to refine it, improve it, sublimate it. But the ape may have made the same mistake amid its revolution that produced man; perhaps it sought to become a super-ape, better equipped to climb trees, hunt and run, a more agile and clever ape. With Nietzsche we too sought a "superman" who was nothing more than a colossalization of man, and with the spiritualists a super-saint more richly endowed with virtue and wisdom. But human virtue and wisdom are useless! Even when carried to their highest heights they are nothing more than the old poverties gilded over, the obverse of our tenacious misery. "Supermanhood," says Sri Aurobindo, "is not man climbed to his own natural zenith, not a superior degree of human greatness, knowledge, power, intelligence, will,... genius,... saintliness, love, purity or perfection."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="98" href="#">7</a> It is SOMETHING ELSE, another vibration of being, another consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">But if this new consciousness is not to be found on the peaks of the human, where then, are we to find it? Perhaps, quite simply in that which we have most neglected since we entered the mental cycle, in the body. The body is our base, our evolutionary foundation, the old stock to which we always return, and which painfully compels our attention by making us suffer, age and die. "In that imperfection," Sri Aurobindo assures us, "is the urge towards a higher and more many-sided perfection. It contains the last finite which yet yearns to the Supreme Infinite.... God is pent in the mire... but the very fact imposes a necessity to break through that prison."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">8</a> That is the old, uncured Illness, the unchanged root, the dark matrix of our misery, hardly different now from what it was in the time of Lemuria. It is this physical substance which we must transform, otherwise it will topple, one after another, all the human or superhuman devices we try to graft on it. This body, this physical cellular substance contains "almighty powers,"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">9</a> a dumb consciousness that harbors all the lights and all the infinitudes, just as much as the mental and spiritual immensities do. For, in truth, all is Divine and unless the Lord of all the universe resides in a single little cell he resides nowhere. It is this</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 330</p>
<p class="P"> original, dark cellular Prison which we must break open; for as long as we have not broken it, we will continue to turn vainly in the golden or iron circles of our mental prison. "These laws of Nature," says Sri Aurobindo, "that you call absolute... merely mean an equilibrium established to work in order to produce certain results. But, if you change the consciousness, then the groove also is bound to change."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="101" href="#">10</a></p>
<p class="P">Such is the new adventure to which Sri Aurobindo invites us, an adventure into man's unknown. Whether we like it or not, the whole earth is moving into a new groove, but why shouldn't we like it? Why shouldn't we collaborate in this great, unprecedented adventure? Why shouldn't we collaborate in our own evolution, instead of repeating endlessly the same old story, instead of chasing hallucinatory paradises which will never quench our thirst or otherworldly paradises which leave the earth to rot along with our bodies? "Why be born if it is to get out at the end?" exclaims the Mother, who continues Sri Aurobindo's work. "What is the use of having struggled so much, suffered so much, of having created something which, in its outer appearance at least, is so tragic and dramatic, if it is only to learn how to get out of it – it would have been better not to start at all.... Evolution is not a tortuous course that brings us back, somewhat battered, to the starting point. Quite the contrary, it is meant," says Mother, "to teach the whole of creation the joy of being, the beauty of being, the grandeur of being, the majesty of a sublime life, and the perpetual development, perpetually progressive, of this joy, this beauty, this grandeur. Then everything has a meaning."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">11</a></p>
<p class="P">This body, this obscure beast of burden we inhabit, is the experimental field of Sri Aurobindo's yoga – which is a yoga of the whole earth, for one can easily understand that if a single being among our millions of sufferings succeeds in negotiating the evolutionary leap, the mutation of the next age, the face of the earth will be radically altered. Then all the so-called powers of which we boast today will seem like childish games before the radiance of this almighty embodied spirit. Sri Aurobindo tells us that it is possible – not only possible but that it will be done. It is being done. And perhaps everything depends not so much on a sublime effort of humanity to transcend its limitations – for that means</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 331</p>
<p class="P"> still using our own human strength to free ourselves from human strength – as on a call, a conscious cry of the earth to this new being which the earth already carries within itself. All is already there, within our hearts, the supreme Source which is the supreme Power – only we must call it into our forest of cement, we must understand the meaning of man, the meaning of ourselves. The amplified cry of the earth, of its millions of men and women who cannot bear it anymore, who no longer accept their prison, must open a crack to let the new vibration in. Then all the apparently ineluctable laws that bind us in their hereditary and scientific groove will crumble before the Joy of the "sun-eyed children."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="103" href="#">12</a> "Expect nothing from death," says Mother, "life is your salvation. It is in life that you must transform yourself. It is on earth that you progress and on earth that you realize. It is in the body that you win the Victory."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="104" href="#">13</a></p>

Really extraordinary. What actually took place isn't what I saw, for it was seen years ahead.... But that doesn't matter, it's all right.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Sujata comes in late. Mother hands her the handkerchiefs, laughing</em>)</p>
<p class="P">These are my handkerchiefs!</p>
<p class="P">We're always in a hurry, because life on earth is short, but when you see what is in the offing... (<em>vast, circular gesture</em>). Really beautiful, much better! It takes more time, but it's much better.</p>
<p class="P">One of the things in the offing is the conversion of America, the United States, but it will take time.</p>
<p class="P">The conversion of the United States.</p>
<p class="P">Already, most of the country is against that president, but it has to become strong enough for that... particular policy to disappear.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="109" href="#">2</a></p>

<p class="P">Yes. Yes.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Do you have anything?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Nothing.... Maybe some personal questions.</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, ask.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I have the impression that for about a year now there has been no creative force coming into me – no inspiration and no creative force. I was speaking about it with Sujata a few days ago, and she had a vision: she saw something like two enormous silver doors – which were closed. So I don't know, I wonder what that means. Why that closure?</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>after a silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 336</p>
<p class="P">Well, for some time there's been much more insistence on personal transformation than on creation, for you. I have seen that. And it seems to me of capital importance, you understand?... There's a special insistence on personal transformation. Which means that, when that is done, the creative work will be of a much, MUCH higher order.</p>
<p class="P"><em>So, I shouldn't worry?</em></p>
<p class="P">No, not at all. On the contrary.</p>
<p class="P">Really, to put it childishly, the Divine Wisdom is far greater than ours. I perceive that constantly. We have a very short view of things – very short and limited. While the Divine Wisdom is.... You get such a feeling of not knowing anything when you compare your way of seeing to the Divine's way of seeing (I am putting it rather childishly).</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, but practically, there are two possible attitudes with respect to the creative force: either to be completely passive and wait (but then, isn't that passivity simply a kind of inertia?), or else do as those who create do, that is, call the Force and pull it down. In other words, they actively intervene to create.</em></p>
<p class="P">There is a third attitude. It's the best. To be very attentive; rather than being passive and inert, to be very attentive and alert. And then, to feel when the Impulsion to do something comes, and to do it. I have put that into practice these last few days, and that's the solution. You see, the difficulty lies in having action WITHOUT the personal limitations – they are inextricably bound up in our consciousness, and the passivity you speak of is there to separate the two; but once you have... I don't know, the perception or sensation of the state in which you are completely open to the Divine Impulsion, then you can allow action to take place again. And that is the solution.</p>
<p class="P">It's very difficult to explain, but I've had the experience recently (yesterday or the day before, it's very recent), the experience of an attitude of unmixed receptivity – unmixed with any personal activity – an activity whose impulse comes only from the Divine (I had this in connection with the war, the current events, and that's how I understood). But it's beyond words.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 337</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">So, the things in the offing are a federation of all the states of India, and another one in the offing is the conversion of the United States. A federation of the states of India along the lines of The Ideal of Human Unity, as conceived and explained by Sri Aurobindo. And the conversion of the United States is in the same idea, just according to Sri Aurobindo's revelation. But that will take time.</p>
<p class="P">It came in an imperative way.</p>
<p class="P">Also I heard something Sri Aurobindo wrote, where he says that in order for the Supermind to manifest on earth, the physical mind has to receive and manifest it. And the physical mind, I mean the bodily mind, mine, is precisely the only one I have left now. And so it came to me very clearly that that is why that one alone was left. And it is being converted very rapidly and interestingly. The physical mind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="110" href="#">3</a> is developing under the supramental influence. And it's just what Sri Aurobindo wrote, that it was indispensable so the Supermind could manifest on earth in a permanent way.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">4</a></p>
<p class="P">So all's well – it's not easy! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) But all is well.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, that's just the problem I wondered about. You say that for me, for instance, the insistence is on personal transformation – well, I saw something ("I saw" – well, anyway I felt something), I felt that the transformation (of the lower nature, for example) is not really possible unless a sort of radical change of position in the consciousness takes place, or a change of vision....</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 338</p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>... unless things and people are seen differently.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But then I wonder how it's possible.</em></p>
<p class="P">That way it's possible.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But it has to be pretty radical.</em></p>
<p class="P">But it is radical, mon petit! You can't imagine, it's like.... I could really say I've become another person. Only this (<em>Mother indicates the appearance of her body</em>) is still like this, the same as it was.... To what extent will it be able to change? Sri Aurobindo said that if the physical mind is transformed, the body's transformation will follow quite NATURALLY. We'll see.</p>
<p class="P">But could you give me a key or a lever to effect the radical change?</p>
<p class="P">Ah, I don't know, because for me everything was simply taken away – the mind is completely gone. If you like, in appearance I had become an idiot, I didn't know anything. And it's the physical mind that developed, slowly, slowly.</p>
<p class="P">In my case, I don't know, the work was done for me – I did nothing. That's how it was done, very radically. It could be done because I was VERY conscious of my psychic (the psychic being which was formed through all the lives), I was very conscious of it, and it remained; it remained and enabled me to deal with people without its making any difference, thanks to that psychic presence. That's why there were very few apparent changes. So I can speak only of what I know, and I'll say this: the psychic has to remain very much in command of the whole being – the whole bodily being – guiding the life, then the mind has time to be transformed. Mine was simply sent away.</p>
<p class="P">You see, the transformation of the bodily mind was indispensable because that's the only one I had left, you follow?... Very few people would accept that. (<em>Laughing</em>) In my case, it was done without asking my opinion! The work was very easy.</p>
<p class="P">That's exactly what happened.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 339</p>
<p class="P"><em>I wish something drastic would happen to me....</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>For instance, I was thinking (it's childish), but I was thinking the other day: if I could just see with Sri Aurobindo's eyes....</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Instead of seeing through my eyes, let me see things through his eyes.</em></p>
<p class="P">But it wasn't his physical eyes. It wasn't his physical eyes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I wish it could be like that. But is it possible?</em></p>
<p class="P">You mean to see with Sri Aurobindo's consciousness?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, that's right. But to see people, things, circumstances PHYSICALLY, that way.</em></p>
<p class="P">It's possible. It's possible.... But would you accept what happened to me, that is, the individual, the person feels itself absolutely stupid?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, I'm ready!</em></p>
<p class="P">You wouldn't despair?</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, no. Absolutely not.</em></p>
<p class="P">You see, what's taking root permanently, as it were, is this: the nonentity of the person – the absolute nonentity and incapacity. And then you're... you're fine; you're quite naturally like a child, you say to the Divine, "Do everything for me" (there's nothing left, so you can't do anything!), then everything goes well immediately – immediately.</p>
<p class="P">You see, the body has given itself entirely. It even said to the Divine, "I beg You to make me want my dissolution if I must die," so that EVEN THERE I won't offer any resistance, should it be necessary for this body to die – to want my dissolution. That's its attitude, it was like this (<em>gesture of open hands</em>). But instead, there</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 340</p>
<p class="P"> came a sort of... (I could put it into words, but it wasn't words): "If you accept suffering and discomfort, transformation is better than dissolution." And so when it feels uncomfortable, it accepts.</p>
<p class="P">It's not like that; what I say is [inadequate]. It's not really like that, but it's hard to explain. It's really a new attitude and a new sensation, I can't express it.</p>
<p class="P">And for each one obviously it must be different.... For me it was very radical – I didn't have any choice, you understand: it was like that, and that's that.</p>
<p class="P">But we truly have to.... What made things easy is that the psychic consciousness was completely in the forefront and ruling the life, so it just went on quietly without being concerned with the rest.</p>
<p class="P">It's like sight and hearing, I've noticed that it's not a physical deterioration: it's simply that I understand and hear people only when they think clearly what they say. And I see only what is... what expresses the inner life, otherwise things are... hazy or veiled. It's not that my eyes don't see, it's "something," it's something else – everything is new.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">It was what Sri Aurobindo told me when I asked to leave (we both knew one of us had to go); I immediately said to him, "I will go." And he said no, he told me, "Your body is much more capable than mine of bearing the work of transformation." Sri Aurobindo told me that. And so it accepted, but....</p>
<p class="P">It's true, the body has to be VERY goodwilled – it so happens that mine is; and it's not a mental goodwill, of course, it's really a bodily goodwill. It accepts, it accepts all the drawbacks.... But the attitude is important, not the consequences (I am convinced that the drawbacks are not indispensable), it's the attitude that is important. It has to be like this (<em>gesture of open hands</em>), you see. Truly I have noticed that in most cases, surrender to the Divine does not mean trust in the Divine – because when you surrender to the Divine, you say, "Even if You make me suffer, I surrender," but that's an absolute lack of trust! That's really amusing, surrender DOES NOT IMPLY trust; trust is something else, it's... a kind of knowledge – an <em>unshakable</em> knowledge, which nothing can disturb – it's WE who change into difficulties, suffering, misery what is... perfect peace in the Divine Consciousness. It's we who create that little "transformation."</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 341</p>
<p class="P">And I had some extraordinary examples.... It would take hours to describe.</p>
<p class="P">But it's really the consciousness that must change – and even the consciousness OF THE CELLS, you understand?... That, that's a radical change.</p>
<p class="P">And there are no words to express it, because it didn't exist on earth – it was latent, but it wasn't manifested.</p>
<p class="P">All words... miss the mark, that's never quite it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">If you like, I could say that at each minute you feel you can either live eternally or die (<em>gesture of a slight tilt from one side to the other</em>). Every minute is like that. And the difference [between the two] is so slight that you can't say: Do this and you'll be on this side, do that and you'll be on the other – not possible. It's a way of being almost beyond description.</p>

You know that for a very long time now I have completely stopped being hungry (I eat only to be reasonable, because "one must" eat, otherwise...), and I have some small difficulty in swallowing, or breathing (ridiculous things), but everything changes depending on whether you pay attention to them or not, depending on an attitude like this (<em>gesture of being focused on oneself</em>) in which you watch yourself living, or an attitude in which you're (<em>vast gesture</em>) in things, in movement, in life; and a third attitude in which you pay attention only to the Divine. If you succeed in being like that all the time, there are no difficulties – and yet things are the same. That's the experience: the thing in itself is as it is, but it is our reaction to it that differs. The experience is more and more conclusive. You see, there are three categories: our attitude with respect to things, the things in themselves (those two always give you trouble), and there is a third category in which everything, but everything is in regard to the Divine, in the Consciousness of the Divine – all is marvelous, all is easy! And I am speaking of material things, of the material, physical life (for psychological things, we've known it for long), I mean material things like little discomforts of the body, or reactions, feeling pain or not, circumstances going wrong, not being able to swallow your dinner – the most banal things you don't pay attention to when you're young and strong and in good health (you don't pay any attention to them, and it's like that for everyone), but when you live in the consciousness of your body and what happens to it and its ways of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 346</p>
<p class="P"> receiving things that come and so on – oh, it's misery! When you live in the consciousness of others, of what they want, what they need, their relationship with you – it's misery! But if you live in the Divine Presence and it's the Divine who does everything, sees everything, is everything... it's Peace – it's Peace, time has no duration, everything is easy and.... Not that you feel joy or feel... it's not so... it's the Divine who is there. And it's the ONLY solution. That's where the world is going: the Consciousness of the Divine – the Divine who does, the Divine who is, the Divine.... So then, the same IDENTICAL circumstance (I am not speaking of different circumstances), the same IDENTICAL circumstance (it's my experience these last few days, so concrete, you know, so concrete); day before yesterday I was sick as a dog, and yesterday circumstances were the same, my body was in the same state, all was the same and yet... all was peaceful.</p>
<p class="P">I am thoroughly convinced of that.</p>
<p class="P">If only I didn't have so much trouble speaking.... That explains everything. It explains everything, all, all.</p>
<p class="P">The world is the same – it is seen and felt in a totally opposite way.</p>
<p class="P">Everything is a phenomenon of consciousness – everything. Only, it is not a matter of this consciousness, or that one, or that other one, that's not it: it's our way, the human way of being conscious versus the divine way of being conscious. That's all. That's the whole question. And I am thoroughly convinced.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>In a word, the world is as it should be at each second.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's we who see it wrongly or feel it wrongly or receive it wrongly.</em></p>
<p class="P">It's like death, you see. The phenomenon is transitional, but seems to us to have existed forever (it's forever for us because our consciousness is like this – <em>Mother draws a little square in the air</em>), but when you have that divine consciousness, oh!... things become almost instantaneous, you understand. I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="P">There IS movement, there IS progression, there IS what is translated for us by time, that exists, it's something... something</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 347</p>
<p class="P">in the consciousness.... It's hard to express.... It's like an object and its projection. A little like that. All things ARE, but for us, we see them projected on a screen, as it were: one comes after another. It's a little like that.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Sri Aurobindo said that in the supramental consciousness, past, present and future exist side by side on a single map of knowledge.</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="113-1" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P">Yes, that's it. That's right. But for me it is an experience. Not something I "think" (I don't think), but an experience. And hard to explain.</p>
<p class="P">And its effect on us, the sensation it produces in us depends exclusively on the position of our consciousness. There is the consciousness of being in oneself or being in the whole (being in the whole is already a bit better than being egoistically oneself, and it has its advantages and disadvantages, but it's not the truth), the Truth is... the Divine as totality – totality in time and totality in space. And that consciousness, the body CAN have, because this body had it (momentarily, for a few moments), and while it has it, everything is so... you see, it's not joy, it's not pleasure, it's not happiness, nothing of all that... a sort of blissful peace... and luminous... and creative. Magnificent. Only, it comes and goes, comes and goes.... And when you go out of it, you have the impression of falling into a horrible pit – our ordinary consciousness (I mean the ordinary human consciousness) is a horrible pit. But we also know why it had to be momentarily that way, for it was necessary in order to go from this to that: everything that happens is necessary for the full development of the goal of creation. You could say (we could word-paint): the goal of creation is for the creature to become conscious as the Creator. There you are.</p>
<p class="P">It's word-painting, but it's in that direction.</p>
<p class="P">This creation's goal is that Consciousness of the Infinite, the Eternal, which is omnipotent – Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent (which our religions have called God: for us, with respect to life, it's the Divine) – Infinite and Eternal, All-Powerful... outside of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 348</p>
<p class="P"> time: each individual particle possessing that Consciousness; each individual particle containing that same Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">Division created the world, and it is in division that the Eternal manifests.</p>
<p class="P">Words are stupid, but that's how it is. I don't know if you follow.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">With, in addition (and not as a contradiction, but as a complement), the exact sense of what you are supposed to do – what you are supposed to be, what you are supposed to do and why you have been created. And all that TOGETHER... oh!... (<em>Mother has a blissful smile</em>)</p>
<p class="P">That gives both the reason and the goal of creation – both at once – and almost the method of development.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Yes, it's like something that IS, that is as a whole and is successively projected on a screen. And yet it exists as a whole – and it is projected successively on a screen.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes into contemplation</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I have the impression that I am on the way to discovering... the illusion that must be destroyed so that physical life can be uninterrupted – discovering that death comes from a... a distortion of consciousness. That's it.</p>
<p class="P">It's this close, you know (<em>Mother makes a gesture as if she were about to grasp the secret</em>).</p>
<p class="P">And as I told you, sometimes I feel that the great number of years makes the work somewhat more difficult, but taken on the whole, it is a GREAT help – I understood that were I young, I could never have done what I am doing. And when I am in the true consciousness, the moment I am in the true consciousness, the number of years is nothing! – The body feels so young, so full of... something else than young (for it, young is <em>immature</em> and ignorant, it's not that), it's... you're in communion with "something"... which changes according to the need.</p>
<p class="P">Our language (or our consciousness) is... inadequate. Later I'll be able to say.</p>

<p class="P"><em>A disciple in America had sent a cartoon published in an American newspaper showing Bangladesh ("East Pakistan") bloody and gored by the horns of a furious Indian "sacred cow," equipped with Soviet weapons. When the drawing was shown to Mother by Sujata, she angrily rejected it, sweeping it off her knees: "Take it away." Then, a few moments later, she asked for the drawing back, took a pen and wrote across the drawing: "This is disgustingly untrue," the way one performs an occult act to destroy or neutralize something.</em></p>
