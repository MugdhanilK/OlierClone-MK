<h2>Mother’s Agenda</h2>
<h3>1971</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document  —  6,000 pages in 13 volumes  —  is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death  —  upon the very power that changes death  —  and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3">Physical vision requires a much more continuous concentration. The physical vision serves to stabilize. It gives continuity to things. The same with hearing. So when neither of them are there, you become conscious of the thing directly, which gives you the true knowledge of it. That is probably how the Supermind will work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-4">My physical vision and hearing have been pushed into the background to be replaced by identity through consciousness – for the growth of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-5">The way of relating to things, of knowing, is through an identification of the consciousness with the thing or person. Instead of having the usual sense of separateness, you have a constant sense of union. There are quite interesting experiences. People call me and think about me. That comes into my field of consciousness. And after some time I am told, "So and so has come," or "Something has happened to so and so," and I say, "I know." I wasn't told anything at the time it happened, but I was conscious of it as if it were happening to a part of me.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Satprem has not seen Mother since last December 2. The latest turning point in her yoga has just occurred, similar to those of 1962 and 1968. Her small voice quivers and is lost in a murmur, yet her laugh is fresh as a young girl's.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-6">I am happy to see you!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 19</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-7"><em>Good morning, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-8">Are you feeling better?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-9"><em>Yes, Mother. It's been a long time since I've seen you....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-10">Yes.... One of my legs went dead for a long time – it's just starting to come back to life – it was paralyzed. This leg (<em>the left</em>). So naturally everything was difficult.... I had an intestinal ulcer, but that didn't last long. It was more serious but it didn't last. An intestinal ulcer. But what ties me down is this leg that became paralyzed. (<em>Mother touches her left leg.</em>) The lower part of it, from the knee to the heel. So naturally you become an imbecile!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-11"><em>Oh!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-12">You are completely helpless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-13"><em>But then it means a lot of work is being done, doesn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-14">What was remarkable (I want to tell you this right away) is that the consciousness established there (<em>gesture above her head</em>) has grown stronger and stronger and clearer and clearer. And it's CONSTANT. I worked – I went on working – not only for India but for the world, and in touch ("consulted," you understand), actively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-15">As for the transformation, I don't know.... What I had explained about the "replacement of the consciousness" (<em>the transfer</em>) went on methodically, methodically, absolutely methodically and continuously, but with... some apparent impairment, or at least the capacities of my body were greatly diminished for a certain time. But there is a curious phenomenon concerning sight and hearing: from time to time they're clear, as clear as can be, and at other times they're completely blurred. And it has very, very clearly another origin – another origin of influence. But I think it will take months before I can understand it. In any case, the general consciousness (<em>gesture above her head</em>), what could be called the universal consciousness (or at least terrestrial), hasn't budged for one minute – not one single minute. It has stayed there all the time. Only, you're a complete imbecile; you know how it is when you can't do anything: you're helpless, you can't even go from your chair to the bed, you can't do anything – one leg isn't there.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 20</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-16"> Even now I can't walk unaided, I need someone to hold me up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-17"><em>But it will come back, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-18">It is coming back. It is coming back little by little. There was a time when it was total: it was cold as ice. There was no circulation. Something had blocked the circulation. Now it's better, it's coming back to life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-19">Only, I thought of the <em>Bulletin</em>, we can't leave the <em>Bulletin</em> like that. Did you prepare it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-20"><em>Yes, it's all ready, Mother. I've already given it to the Press.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-21">Oh, what did you give?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-22">Here....</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother gives some packages of soup</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-23"><em>Thank you, Mother.... First, "The Synthesis of Yoga" (the chapter on "The Liberation of the Spirit"), then "Conversations with Pavitra," then "Thoughts and Aphorisms" commented on by you, and then "Mother Answers," and finally two old Talks of 1953 in the Playground.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-24">Oh, that's... [old].</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-29"><em>So you answer that if you had very "realized" people, they would probably be more resistant to your influence.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother nods her head</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-30">Did you see what Z noted down [note of January 11, 1971]?</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 21</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-31"><em>Yes, Mother, I've seen it.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-32">What did you think of it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-33"><em>I thought it probably would have to be like that: it's the beginning of a new functioning.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-34">It's a new functioning. It's interesting. In fact I was thinking that perhaps I could explain it to you if you ask me a question or two. And then, maybe it could be used [for the <em>Bulletin</em>], so there's not an abrupt break in the continuity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-35"><em>Is it your perception of people and circumstances that has changed? Your way of perceiving things?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-36">Yes, completely – completely. It's very strange....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-37">Basically, all that time was used to develop the consciousness of the physical being. It really seems as if this physical being (<em>Mother touches her body</em>) had been prepared for another consciousness, because for certain things... its reactions are entirely different, its attitude is different. I went through a period of total indifference in which the world represented... meant nothing. And then little by little a kind of new perception grew out of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-38">I am only in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-39">But I was thinking that for the <em>Bulletin</em> perhaps we could put a note that would connect the different periods, because going abruptly, without any bridge from what was to what will be – what I feel will be – would be very difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-40">How did you feel about that note?... I am all the more interested because I didn't have any contact with anyone at that point: Z happened to be cleaning the room while the others were busy – they were my legs to do things! It was quite a physical task, you know: to get me from a chair to an armchair and from the armchair to the bed.... It was really bad, I was like a child – worse, worse because the rest of the body, all the rest of the body was normal, but for some time one of my legs was simply... it was as if it were finished, as if there were nothing there. And little by little, little by little it came back. That was the final period. But it was not an innocent paralysis! For at least three weeks – at least – for three weeks there was a continuous pain, night and day, 24 hours out of 24, without any letup, none whatsoever: it was as if everything were being torn out of me.... You know, I don't usually</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-41"> complain, but I was almost forced to cry out loud all the time. So, of course, there was no question of seeing anyone. Now it's over. The pain is quite bearable and the body has resumed a somewhat normal existence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-42">But I wanted to tell you that my consciousness was actively with you all the time; I thought: if he feels it, so much the better; if he doesn't... it doesn't matter.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-43"><em>I felt the Power very intensely.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-44">Oh, then that's it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-45"><em>Yes, quite instantaneously, quite immediately.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-46">Then it's all right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-47"><em>Above all, I thought that if it had gone down into your legs, that meant it had now completely gone down into matter.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-48">Yes, exactly! But I took it that way too. Not only was it the leg, but the lower part of the leg (<em>Mother points to her feet</em>). This one (<em>Mother touches her right leg</em>) was on the verge of being paralyzed also, but the day it happened, I concentrated with a vengeance, I walked for a long, long time to keep it from being paralyzed. I managed to keep it from being paralyzed; only this one (<em>left one</em>) was stricken.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-49">But the whole body has changed drastically. For example, with respect to food, I have absolutely no appetite – none whatsoever. For a time, I even felt disgusted, a kind of disgust for food – it was very difficult because they wanted to force me to eat just the same.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="2" href="#">2</a> To me eating seemed like something... miserable, you know, without any meaning, exactly as if I had never eaten in my life. Out of sheer effort I managed to go on taking what is considered indispensable (<em>laughing</em>) to keep the body alive!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-50">It nearly became serious when an ulcer erupted in the intestines. An ulcer erupted, and then naturally there was no question of eating.... But I have noticed how those things, the so-called</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-51"> catastrophes or calamities or mishaps or difficulties or... how they all come JUST at the right moment to help you – JUST when it's needed to help you.... You see, everything in the physical nature that still belonged to the old world and its habit and ways of doing and being and acting, all that couldn't be (<em>handled</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="3" href="#">3</a> is the word), it couldn't be handled in any other way than this: by illness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-52">The doctors were quite concerned about the intestinal ulcer. If it had perforated, it would have been very, very serious – the ordinary recourse is an operation, so.... The doctors were quite concerned. But they didn't show anything, I didn't know about it – I found out about the ulcer only when it was healed (I mean when it was in the process of healing).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-53">It certainly was interesting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-479">"As there is a category of facts to which our senses are our best available but very imperfect guides, as there is a category of truths which we seek by the keen but still imperfect light of our reason, so according to the mystic, there is a category of more subtle truths which surpass the reach both of the senses and the reason but can be ascertained by an inner direct knowledge and direct experience. These truths are supersensuous, but not the less real for that: they have immense results upon the consciousness changing its substance and movement, bringing especially deep peace and abiding joy, a great light of vision and knowledge, a possibility of the overcoming of the lower animal nature, vistas of a spiritual self-development which without them do not exist. A new outlook on things arises which brings with it, if fully pursued into its consequences, a great liberation, inner harmony, unification – many other possibilities besides. These things have been experienced, it is true, by a small minority of the human race, but still there has been a host of independent witnesses to them in all times, climes and conditions and numbered among them are some of the greatest intelligences of the past, some of the world's most remarkable figures. Must these possibilities be immediately condemned as chimeras</p></blockquote>

If there is any truth in them, is not this possibility opened by them worth pursuing as disclosing a highest range of self-discovery and world discovery by the human soul? At its best, taken as true, it must be that – at its lowest taken as only a possibility, as all things attained by man have been only a possibility in their earlier stages, it is a great and may well be a most fruitful adventure."</p>

You said in particular that the word "mental" [mind] and the word "esprit" [spirit] should not be translated by the same word.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-491">Of course not!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-492"><em>So various words were suggested for</em> "mental" <em>and</em> "esprit," <em>and finally we had chosen two words: the word</em> "Geist" <em>for</em> "mental" <em>(if I remember correctly) and the word</em> "Spirit" <em>for</em> "esprit," <em>although</em> "Spirit" <em>isn't German.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-498">We should find out what T.K. is using, because.... Using the same word is out of the question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-499"><em>But T.K. may not use the same word because she has a totally different vocabulary.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-500">Yes, but we should find out what it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-501">We have Germans here, don't we?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-502"><em>They can't agree with one another! (laughter)</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-505">Yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-506"><em>But I feel C.S. should be told he can't dictate.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-507">No, he can't dictate. How can he?... Moreover, he doesn't have the means.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-508"><em>For example he said that since he has a book-sales office, he would refuse to sell any book using a different terminology!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-509">That's absurd.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-510">What should be done for these books is to put a note in, to insert a note in each book saying that this particular word used here corresponds to that word used in the other books – to let people know. Because if it's the same word as <em>"mental,"</em> that leads to terrible confusion – terrible, the worst confusion. There has to be a distinction, it's imperative: either T.K. has to put a note or.... Because you see, if they put <em>"mental"</em> for both words, or even another word that means the same thing, it distorts the teaching immediately. It immediately creates terrible confusion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-511">In any event, there should be a note explaining that the word is taken in a particular sense.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-516">I don't like it either.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-517">But is German such a poor language? Isn't all this ignorance on their part?... They could take a word that isn't a common word and give it a special meaning – and then, put in a note the special meaning they've given the word. But to use a word that means "mind" is crazy, it immediately distorts the teaching.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-518"><em>Yes. The trouble is that the word they use for "spirit" is the word generally used for "mind." So, if it is left exclusively to mean "mind," they don't have anything for "spirit," but if they use it exclusively for "spirit," it may be interpreted as "mind."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-519">No, they should put a note.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>Satprem had received the following letter from an enthusiastic reader of "On the Way to Supermanhood":</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-835"><em>"Until the year of grace 1969 [the descent of the New Consciousness], all philosophies, all religions, all isms, all spiritual paths were only the refined products of the 'mental circle' [according to 'Supermanhood']. All experiences were merely on 'the higher planes of the mind.' Those 'peaks of the Spirit' are but 'self-paroxysms,' p. 61; 'we must cleanse ourselves of the wisdoms of the past, the ascents of the past, the illuminations of the past and the whole racket of the old sanctities of the Spirit,' p. 29, etc. In other words, everything that took place before 1969 is a sublimation of the 'old flesh,' p. 28. It is quite clear. Some have touched the Secret: the Rishis, the Egyptians – the reader understands that they had the intuition of it but not the experience. The same applies to Sri Aurobindo, who 'announced' it, but his yoga extended the refinement of the 'mental bubble'; the reader thus understands that he did not know about the key to the yoga of the superman and was merely satisfied in teaching the integral yoga...."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-836"><em>The misconception of this enthusiastic reader is like a demonstration in reverse of precisely what the "orthodox" reproached "Supermanhood" for, i.e., of having betrayed Sri Aurobindo. Behind this so-called schism were hidden, on the one hand, those who wanted to separate Mother and Sri Aurobindo and found it more comfortable to philosophize than to do the yoga concretely, and on the other hand, those who wanted conveniently to dispense with all spiritual disciplines and live according to their fancy. Two poles of the same misconception. Here then is the letter Satprem sent in response to this enthusiastic reader:</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-837" style="text-align: right;">Pondicherry, 6. April 1971</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-838">You have a lot of nerve to say that Sri Aurobindo did not have the key to the yoga of the superman and that his integral yoga was a refinement of the mental bubble! And where have I learned what I write, if not from Mother and Sri Aurobindo? You forget that it is thanks to him that the yoga of the superman is possible, that it is he who prepared it, he who brought down the great flood of the New Consciousness so that, instead of seeking for the Divine Truth up above, men can live it down here and walk their every step in it. It is like saying that Sri Aurobindo did not have the key to the door he opened!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-839">His yoga is integral because, instead of confining the quest to the spiritual heights, he has told us repeatedly that our body too must participate and we must bring the Spiritual Truth down into our body and our life. The path of ascent and all the other paths, the other planes of consciousness, are part of an integral development – for those who have the time and the special capacities that are required. But it is no longer the time for those excursions, since everything can be found <em>here</em> – since, in fact, Sri Aurobindo and Mother opened the way HERE. Please recall Mother's statement: "Sri Aurobindo came to tell us: one need not leave the earth to find the Truth, one need not leave life to find one's soul, one need not abandon the world or have limited beliefs to enter into relation with the Divine. The Divine is everywhere, in everything, and if he is hidden, it is because we do not take the trouble to find him." (<em>Questions and Answers</em>, 8.13.1958) And again this: "For many, spiritual life is meditation. As long as that nonsense is not uprooted from human consciousness, the supramental force will always find it very difficult not to be swallowed up in the obscurity of an uncomprehending human mind." (<em>Questions and Answers</em>, 4.17.1957) And if you know how to read Sri Aurobindo and Mother, you will see that they have completely described this road of here and the sunlit path – <em>On the Way to Supermanhood</em> only puts an intentionally exclusive accent on the "here," because there is no time to lose, because everyone does not have the special capacities for making large-scale explorations, and finally because we are at the Hour of God – <em>we are right there!</em> It has come. Because there really is something different in the world since 1969.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-840">It is not a change in Sri Aurobindo's yoga, it is the flowering of Sri Aurobindo's yoga, I dare say. I do not think that the flower of the flame tree contradicts in any way the flame tree.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-841">Now, you have completely confused the psychic and the spiritual. The psychic, the soul, the Fire within, Agni, does not belong to the "mental bubble" or to any bubble: it is the Divine in matter. It is that little Fire which opens the door to the great solar Fire of the New Consciousness. It is the instrument of the yoga of the superman (when I speak of turning on the "psychic switch," I am there taking the word in the vulgar and ridiculous sense of people seeking visionary and occult experiences – not in the true sense). Others in every age have had the experience of the psychic, of the inner Fire, but aside from the Rishis, no one used it to transform matter; the religions have made a purely devotional and "mystical" thing out of it. As for "the spiritual," that includes all the planes of consciousness above the ordinary mind. It is the path of ascent. And that is where I repeatedly and emphatically, and from experience, say that those great Experiences, which have to be turned into spiritual summits, are part of the mental bubble (including the overmind): they are the rarefied summits on which the being thins out into a marvelous whiteness, immense, royal, without a ripple of trouble, in an eternal peace – which can last for millenniums without its changing the world one iota, by definition. But the spiritual is <em>not the supramental</em>, and when one touches the supramental, it seems to be almost a whole other Spirit, it is so compact, warm, powerful, present, embodied and radiantly solid in broad daylight. That is the Radiance which Sri Aurobindo and Mother came to bring down on earth – they said over and over that their yoga was new, new, new – and it is through the simple little fire inside us that we can enter into direct contact with That, without sitting in the lotus position or leaving life. When one touches That, the "spiritual" heights seem pale. That is all I have to say. So we do not at all need to be superyogis to have this contact, and those who have found Nirvana, or what have you, have not advanced one inch toward That, because the clue to That is not up there at all or outside, but in your own small capacity of flame.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-842">So if instead of splitting hairs, you set out boldly on the road, afire, you would perhaps discover that we are indeed at the Hour of God and that a single spark of sincere effort, at one's own level, opens doors which have been closed for millenniums.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-845">"One could say that it is far more difficult to go from the mental to the supramental life than to go from a certain psychic emotion in life – something that is like a reflection, a luminous emanation of the divine Presence in matter – to the supramental consciousness; it is much easier to go from that into the supramental consciousness than to go from the highest intellectual speculation to any supramental vibration. Perhaps it is the word that misleads us! Perhaps it is because we call it 'supramental' that we expect to reach it through a higher intellectual mental activity. But the reality is quite different. With this very high and pure and lofty intellectual activity, one seems to go towards a kind of cold, powerless abstraction, an icy light that is surely very remote from life and still further away from the experience of the supramental reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-846">"The new substances that is spreading and acting in the world contains a warmth, a power, a joy so intense that all intellectual activity seems cold and dry beside it. And that is why the less one talks about these things, the better it is. A single instant, a single impulse of deep and true love, a single minute of deep communion with the divine Grace brings you much closer to the goal than all possible explanations."</p>

Here, we have reached the end, the summit, but... it's the quality that is different.

<p class="footnote" id="fn-31"><sup>2</sup> To throw some light on the nature of the “schism,” we include at the end of this conversation the text of a letter written by Satprem to an enthusiastic and erroneous reader.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-32"><sup>3</sup> Satprem was even accused of having “betrayed Sri Aurobindo.” There was a little clique of “intellectuals” in the Ashram, who after Sri Aurobindo's passing refused for a long time to give recognition to Mother (and even while Sri Aurobindo was there, how many letters did he have to write to defend Mother). So we suspect that this same little clique, very influential today, has never really recognized Mother, except by paying lip service, preferring to hide behind a “philosophical Sri Aurobindo,” while Mother was forcing them (or trying to force them) to do a more thorough yoga. This is the essence of the “schism.” This first reaction of the English translator thus prefigures what will break out after Mother's passing. One by one all the little waves were beginning to pile up.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-33"><sup>4</sup> The first version, the one of the third, read: 
India must recognize Bangla-Desh. <em>This is urgent.</em></p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-33-5"><sup>5</sup>In fact, again on the 18th, the day after this conversation, the president of India, V.V. Giri, in a press interview in which he was spiritedly asked why he still had not recognized Bangladesh, said, "The central government is studying the question whether recognition should be granted to Bangladesh." Then he added, "Our sympathy is with the people of Bangladesh. It is up to the Prime Minister [Indira] and the central cabinet to decide the question." (P.T.I)</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>Sri Aurobindo and Bangladesh</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1218">Behind the jostle of temporary points of view and instant interests there are the Eternal Landmarks. To lose sight of them is to lose one's very way and steer onto the reefs of expediency and comfortable compromise upon which we shall founder a moment later. Behind the little frontal events is the greater tide of history and to lose sight of it is to lose one's direction and the golden thread that leads to our perfect fulfillment, be it individual or national. Those who have left their unique mark upon the labyrinth of history are the very ones who have seized the golden thread and affirmed the Greater History and the Greater Meaning against all the instant arguments and fleeting expediencies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1219">The Greater History tells us that the whole earth is a single body with a single destiny, but that within that single destiny each part of the greater body, each nation, has its special role to play and its rare moments of choice when it must make the decisive gesture, its true gesture in the total movement of the great Eternal History. Each nation is a symbol. Each gesture of each nation potentially represents a little victory in the total victory or a little defeat in the total defeat. And sometimes the whole of our history is at stake at a symbolic point of the earth; and, a little gesture, a tiny turn to the right or left, has repercussions, either good or bad, down the ages and over the entire earth body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1220">India is precisely such a symbol and Bangladesh is another, a little turning point in the great course of events of the earth. The time has come to consider the eternal Landmarks and read the greater tide in the small eddies. Now, the greater tide tells us that India's role is to be the spiritual heart of the terrestrial body just as, for example, the role of France is to express clarity of intellect, or that of Germany to express skill, Russia the brotherhood of man and the United States enthusiasm for adventure and practical organization, etc. But only if India is ONE can she fulfill this role, for how can one who is herself divided lead others? Thus the division of India is the first Falsehood that must disappear, for it is the symbol of the earth's division. As long as India is not one, the world cannot be one. India's striving for unity is the symbolic drama of the world's striving for unity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1221">From this simple, eternal Fact follow all the conclusions and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1222"> policies that will flow with the current of the earth's destiny. Sri Aurobindo said so already in 1947, <em>"The division must and will go."</em> Dire will be the consequences for India and for the earth if we fail to heed this eternal Theorem: <em>"The old communal division into Hindus and Muslims seems now to have hardened into a permanent political division of the country,"</em> said Sri Aurobindo. <em>"It is to be hoped that this settled fact will not be accepted as settled for ever or as anything more than a temporary expedient. For if it lasts, India may be seriously weakened, even crippled: civil strife may remain always possible, possible even a new invasion and foreign conquest."</em> We now know, twenty-four years after this prophetic declaration, that China is at our gates and only awaits her hour to invade the entire continent, seizing precisely on this division of India to strike at the spiritual heart of the world and, perhaps, frustrating the realization of the entire destiny of the earth or postponing it until a future cycle after much suffering and complication.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1223">The Great History tells us that India must again be one, and that particular current of history is so imperative that twice already Destiny has managed to put India before the possibility of her reunification. The first time was in 1965 when Pakistan's foolish aggressiveness enabled India to counterattack and carry the battle right into the suburbs of Lahore – and up to Karachi had she but had the courage to seize boldly her destiny. The hour was indeed for a decisive choice. The Mother declared categorically: <em>"India is fighting for the triumph of Truth, and She must fight until India and Pakistan become ONE again, for such is the truth of their being."</em> At Tashkent, we yielded on the crest of a petty compromise which was to lead us into a second, more bloody and painful reef, Bangladesh. There too destiny graciously arranged to enable India to hasten to the aid of her massacred brethren – even the famous skyjacking incident of January<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="48" href="#">4</a> was, as it were, arranged by the Grace so as to spare India from delaying her intervention until it was too late (or to spare her the shame of not intervening at all and allowing Pakistan's planes to fly over her head loaded with weaponry and murderers to slaughter her brothers). But there again, yielding to the demands of the moment and to the small, shortsighted</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1224"> interests, we refused to accept the challenge of the Great Direction of our History, and we now find ourselves on the brink of a new compromise which will lead us inevitably to a third and even more disastrous and bloody reef. For one day India must inevitably face that which twice she has fled. Only each time the conditions are more disastrous for her and for the world – perhaps so disastrous that the whole earth will even be engulfed in another general conflict, while the whole story could have been resolved at the little symbolic point that is Bangladesh, at the right hour, with the right gesture and a minimum of suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1225">For let there be no doubt about it, the Bangladesh affair is not an Indian event, it is a world event. The division of India is not a local incident, it is a terrestrial Falsehood which must disappear if the division of the world is to disappear. And here again we hear the voice of Sri Aurobindo, six months before his passing, referring to yet another phenomenon which then seemed of such slight importance, so remote, a trifling "local" affair at the other end of the world: the invasion of South Korea in 1950, twenty-one years ago. And yet that small Korean symbol, like the small symbol of Bangladesh (or the one of Czechoslovakia in 1938), contained in seed the whole fatal course which is still carrying the world toward a sinister destiny: <em>"The affair of Korea,"</em> wrote Sri Aurobindo, <em>"is the first move in the Communist plan of campaign to dominate and take possession first of these northern parts and then of South East Asia as a preliminary to their manoeuvres with regard to the rest of the continent – in passing, Tibet as a gate opening to India."</em> Now, twenty-one years later, we see that Tibet and the whole of South East Asia have been swallowed up and the "gate into India" has truly been opened wide by the wound of the Pakistani Falsehood – already, or very shortly, the Chinese are, or will be, in Khulna, some eighty miles from Calcutta, to help Yahya Khan to "pacify" Bengal. And Sri Aurobindo added, <em>"If they succeed, there is no reason why domination of the whole world should not follow by steps until they are ready to deal with America."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1226">This is where we are today. That which we want to avoid returns upon us with tenfold force. The hour for political calculation, for the pros and cons of our petty mathematics of expediency (which always goes awry) is past. The time has come to rediscover the Great Direction of India, which is really the Great Direction of the world, and to place our faith in the Spirit that guides her Destiny, rejecting petty fears of a phantom world opinion and doing away</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 140</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1227"> with the little supports which only lend support to the Enemy. Tomorrow America will perhaps resume her economic aid to Pakistan on the pretext of counteracting the Chinese presence. The Bangladesh slaughter will be honorably justified by a pseudoregime which will operate with the blessings of the international community. But one does not cheat the tide of history: for the third time our little compromises will crumble and we will find ourselves confronted with a terrible ordeal, its intensity nourished by our own successive failures in the past. The sooner not only India, but America and Russia too, understand the unreality of Pakistan and the magnitude of what is at stake at the borders of India, the sooner may the looming catastrophe be halted before it becomes totally and definitely irrevocable. <em>"One thing is certain,"</em> wrote Sri Aurobindo a few months before his passing, <em>"that if there is too much shilly-shallying and if America gives up now her defence of Korea"</em> [we could say even more: the defense of Bangladesh] <em>"she may be driven to yield position after position until it is too late: at one point or another she will have to stand and face the necessity of drastic action even if it leads to war."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1228">For the battle of India is the battle of the world. This is where the world's tragic destiny is brewing, or its last-minute burst of hope into a new world of Truth and Light, for it is said that the deepest darkness lies nearest the most luminous light.</p>

And so now it's got into the habit of repeating its mantra, and it repeats it ALL THE TIME. It's a curious thing: if it repeats it, everything runs smoothly; if it doesn't, it can't even swallow food – everything seems on the verge of falling apart; so it repeats its mantra, and everything goes quite well. When it thinks of nothing but the Divine, everything is fine. This morning, while I was having breakfast, that's how it was. It was so plain! If the body thinks about eating, everything goes wrong; if it repeats its mantra, it can absorb the food, it doesn't even notice it, everything becomes so easy. Very interesting....

The body asks but one thing, to melt into the Divine, to be nothing but That, to cease to exist separately – then all is well. It's very interesting. It's really the sadhana of the body, and in quite a compelling way – absolutely compelling.

There is absolutely no meaning in going away, for nothing would be gained by it. One does not escape from what is within oneself by changing place; it follows and reproduces itself under other circumstances and among other surroundings. To go away and die does not solve anything either; for one's being and nature do not end with death, they continue. The only way to get rid of them is here. Here, if you remain, a time is sure to come when these things will go out of you. The suffering it causes cannot cease by going out – it can only cease by the inner cause being removed or else by your drawing back from them and realising your true self which even if they rise would not be troubled by them and would refuse to regard them as part of itself – this liberation too can only come here by sadhana."</p>

One is to sit quiet with a silent will to get rapidly through to the true thing and allow the Force to work out the difficulty. The other is effort, but this effort too must be a quiet effort, – if it is a struggling or over eager effort, it may increase the struggle and restlessness in the mind or body. The best way is to keep quiet, observe, will for the change in reliance on the working of the Force, but also to use a quiet effort whenever that is possible.

She is free to deal with each according to what she sees to be his true need or what is best for him in his spiritual progress. No one can be her judge or impose on her his own rule and standard; she alone can make rules, and she can depart from them too if she thinks fit, but no one can demand that she shall do so. Personal demands and desires cannot be imposed on her. If anyone has what he finds to be a real need or a suggestion to make which is within the province assigned to him, he can do so; but if she gives no sanction, he must remain satisfied and drop the matter. This is the spiritual discipline of which the one who represents or embodies the Divine Truth is the centre. Either she is that and all this is the plain common sense of the matter; or she is not and then no one need stay here. Each can go his own way and there is no Ashram and no Yoga."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1631">The experience in the body is very interesting. All so-called moral, intellectual, psychological suffering, in other words, the suffering of the consciousness that is not purely material, seems childish to the body. Yesterday, it had... (what shall I say? I don't know how to explain it). It doesn't feel things in relation to itself, it feels things... (<em>silence</em>) IN others, but with a general consciousness, not a personal one; and it has such a horror of physical suffering, that is to say illnesses, accidents, that it wondered why, why the world exists like that.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="58" href="#">1</a> It then understood why some people don't want to have a body anymore (that always seemed absurd before), it understood why. It was such an intense experience! It had an aspiration, something like a prayer, but it's not a prayer: "May the world change! May the world change. It HAS to change – or else disappear." The idea of disappearing had not come before, it seemed... it used to think that the world was</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 187</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1632"> moving towards a harmonious perfection; but, you see, it's long – the length of time is terrible! There was an aspiration of incredible intensity for the transformation. Everything looks so dreadful because... because the transformation must, MUST take place. That anyone can be satisfied with a world like this is impossible – it's impossible to a physical consciousness that is conscious of the Divine. It's impossible, it absolutely has to change. And that was so vivid... I was gripped by it all night and all day, even while seeing people, with such an intensity: it must change, it must change....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1633">The being, the inner consciousness can say and be conscious that that suffering is unreal, but the physical consciousness can't – it can't, it HAS to change.

It can't be considered something one must "see in a different way." It actually must change. You understand what I mean?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1636"><em>Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1637">In all the other domains, it depends on the attitude; here it doesn't depend on the attitude – you may suffer more, suffer less, but.... The FACT has to change, you see. Because the world, the material world seen as it is, is a FRIGHTFUL thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1638">You see, it is bearable due to the mental influence (vital and mental), but that influence is not enough, it has to be transformed.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1699">Day before yesterday I was almost cured, I thought it was over, but then yesterday there was an avalanche of things... oh, bad will, quarrels and... it was so dreadful that the cold started up again. That's why it won't go away. I see that when things quiet down here and I can get back into my normal atmosphere, it's as if everything vanished – I don't have a cold anymore, I am not in pain anymore. But back it comes from outside like a ferocious attack: people quarreling, squabbling, circumstances going awry, everything. And all that is thrown on me, so....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1700">So it started up again last evening. It was over, you know: my nose and throat were clear, it was all gone. It really isn't me, it comes from outside. It's relentless. And naturally they all hold me responsible! I tell them one thing, they do another; I write them one thing, they twist it and make it into something else, and then afterwards, they say it's my fault. That's how it is. (<em>Mother starts to cough</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1701">Thoroughly charming.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1704">And it's a kind of half-conscious malice: you do this, they just do that (<em>slight twist</em>), they twist it a little, and everything becomes distorted; you say one thing, they add a word or take one out and it's all distorted. Even what is written they read in their own way. It's stunning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1705">And it's on a large scale, you see, almost a world scale, at least a national one, in this country, but... it has repercussions in China, Russia, Europe, America. They've made... such a <em>mess</em>, you know, with this whole [Bangladesh] affair, it's dreadful – dreadful. Now, they've found a solution: the Americans are trying to come to an agreement with the Chinese – that's the last straw! – to help Pakistan massacre people.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 197</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1741"> that if for a single minute the Supreme Consciousness had the kind of consciousness men have, the world would be dissolved. Quite spontaneously, our reaction, our spontaneous reaction to conflicts, to what seems bad to us, is: let's dissolve the Falsehood. It's a spontaneous reaction. Not transform – dissolve. You see, there's a gulf between the two.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1742"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1743">And it's spontaneous, it's the idea of doing away – doing away with the Falsehood. But if for a single second the Supreme Lord had that movement, there would be no more world!... And so I think the body has understood that. I think it understood, it was extraordinary.... What are we anyway! What are men! They think they're, my God (<em>Mother makes a gesture of puffing herself up</em>), they think they're... oh!... For the slightest will, or a slight comprehension, or when they make a slight effort for perfection, oh! (<em>same gesture</em>) they think they're, they think they're just extraordinary! (<em>Mother takes her head in her hands and laughs.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1744">Somewhere Sri Aurobindo wrote that when you touched the Divine Consciousness, it suddenly gave you the sense of... how laughable the world is in its self-conceit – men's self-conceit.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1761">I am going to tell you something, because it's interesting. Sometime ago, before Z came back, I suddenly saw that Z's relationship with P.L. was preventing him from doing what he had to do. And so I really aspired for her to cease having an influence on him. (I had forgotten that, it was sometime before she came back, a rather long time before.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1762"><em>Yes, I remember, you even told me about it.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1763">It's curious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1764">You know, something I would have told you already is that now the body – the consciousness of the body – knows in advance what's going to happen, it knows in advance what people are going to say. It doesn't know it... (how shall I put it?) exactly as it happens in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 199</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1765"> reality, but rather the SPIRIT in which it's done... constantly. It's perfectly strange. I am here immobile, trying to belong only to the Divine, and things come – they come like this (<em>gesture as though on a screen in front of Mother</em>), they come like this, things, events, people talking.... At first I thought it was my material consciousness, which did not know how to keep quiet, but then I realized it was coming to me from outside and was taking shape materially. Which means that now, if I were to mentalize those things, I could foresee events, tell what is going to happen, what's going to come.... The story about America and China, and all sorts of similar things came in that way. In ordinary men, the mind takes advantage of it to make prophecies – but fortunately there isn't any mind here, it's quiet, it's absent. Only, when I am told things, when I am informed of things, nothing surprises this body anymore, it seems to know. It's strange.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-1766">A kind of universalization.</p>

It's our constitution which is so pitiable. We reduce, distort, diminish EVERYTHING – everything. We know things (Knowledge is there all around us, in us), but we are so complicated that we distort it. Everyone is that way.... So then, this is a kind of very accurate sensation of everything that is organized by the inner Divine from within, and at the same time how it gets distorted as it surfaces (words are silly, and yet that's the closest I can come).

As Y.L. was a little taken aback, he added, "I went there before you, 33 years ago.... So I assume you know what they have been looking for in India...." Again a few days ago, Y.L. met André Malraux after his cry "Volunteer for Bengal"; he said to her, "What is essential in the fight I'm going to wage for Bengal is to know the attitude and action of Pondicherry." Y.L. therefore came to put the question directly to Mother. Mother asked, "When is André Malraux meeting Indira Gandhi?" "In November, in Paris." Mother again asked, "When is André Malraux thinking of coming to India?" "I don't know." Then Mother remained absorbed a long time and said, "He will only get THE answer when he arrives in India, because the answer is in him." After meeting Indira Gandhi in Paris, André Malraux will renounce his plan of action. Let us note that when Y.L. met him, he leafed through the Auroville pressbook and said, "All this is familiar – I'm part of it – I know this." And closing the book, "It's as if the sun had risen.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2463">Dear Chitta,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2464">It is a long time, almost two years I think, since I have written a letter to anyone. I have been so much retired and absorbed in my Sadhana that contact with the outside world has till lately been reduced to minimum.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2465">... I have become confirmed in a perception which I had always, less clearly and dynamically then, but which has now become more and more evident to me, that the true basis of work and life is the spiritual, – that is to say, a new consciousness to be developed only by Yoga. I see more and more manifestly that man can never get out of the futile circle the race is always treading until he has raised himself on to the new foundation. I believe also that it is the mission of India to make this great victory for the world. But what precisely was the nature of the dynamic power of this greater consciousness? What was the condition of its effective truth? How could it be brought down, mobilised, organised, turned upon life? How could our present instruments, intellect, mind, life, body be made true and perfect channels for this great transformation? This was the problem I have been trying to work out in my own experience and I have now a sure basis, a wide knowledge and some mastery of the secret. Not yet its fulness and complete imperative presence – therefore I have still to remain in retirement. For I am determined not to work in the external field till I have the sure and complete possession of this new power of action, – not to build except on a perfect foundation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2466">But still I have gone far enough to be able to undertake one work on a larger scale than before – the training of others to receive this Sadhana and prepare themselves as I have done, for without that my future work cannot even be begun. There are many who desire to come here and whom I can admit for the purpose, there are a greater number who can be trained at a distance; but I am unable to carry on unless I have sufficient funds to be able to maintain a centre here and one or two at least outside. I need therefore much larger resources than I at present command.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2471">... I have been till now and shall be for some time longer withdrawn in the practice of a Yoga destined to be a basis not for withdrawal from life, but for the transformation of human life. It is a Yoga in which vast untried tracts of inner experience and new paths of Sadhana had to be opened up and which, therefore, needed retirement and long time for its completion. But the time is approaching, though it has not yet come, when I shall have to take up a large external work proceeding from the spiritual basis of this Yoga.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2472">It is, therefore, necessary to establish a number of centres small and few at first but enlarging and increasing in number as I go on, for training in this Sadhana....

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2479">Because I know this very well, I am content to work still on the spiritual and psychic plane, preparing there the ideas and forces, which may afterwards at the right moment and under the right conditions precipitate themselves into the vital and material field, and I have been careful not to make any public pronouncement as that might prejudice my possibilities of future action. What that will be will depend on developments. The present trend of politics may end in abortive unrest, but it may also stumble with the aid of external circumstances into some kind of simulacrum of self-government.

It depends on the case. There are cases where nothing is needed. There are cases where it's simply as though you put the Divine ON the thing (<em>Mother makes a gesture of aiming a beam</em>). You know, you're like... not an intermediary, I don't know... it's like a power of concentration on something; then the Divine Force flows through and is focused (<em>same gesture of aiming a beam</em>), but you yourself do nothing – yet the thing is done. Sometimes, if there is a word to be said, then the word comes to you; or if there is something to be done (it may seem like a very small, indifferent thing), you just have to do it quietly – you are LED to do it.</p>

There are times when... nothing – you feel the Force passing and having an effect, but you yourself (I mean, the body), the body doesn't move. It becomes very perceptible. And I've had proof that that's right, because I've had examples: at times, when I've remained still like that, without saying anything, simply letting the Force be focused on someone or something through the body (<em>same gesture of aiming a beam</em>), it does it, it acts miraculously like that. And the body has done nothing, hasn't moved, just let it pass through and be focused on a particular spot (<em>same gesture</em>). It's automatically focused. Because it's in our consciousness that the world is divided like this (<em>gesture of little pieces</em>), and there's one person, another person, one thing, another thing – it's our consciousness which is like that; so "one" uses that [the individuality] as a channel for the Force to go exactly where it is supposed to go.

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2801">"...As for X and Y, you have no claim over them and no right to control their thoughts and actions. X is of an age to choose and decide; he can think and act for himself and has no need of you to think and act for him. You are not his guardian, nor Y's; you are not even the head of the family. On what ground do you claim to decide where he shall go or where he shall stay? Your pretension to have the responsibility for him or her before God is an arrogant and grotesque absurdity. Each one is responsible for himself before God unless he freely chooses to place the responsibility upon another in whom he trusts. No one has the right to impose himself on others as a religious or spiritual guide against their free will. You have no claim at all to dictate to X or Y either in their inner or their outer life. It is again the confusion and incoherence of your mind in its present state that prevents you from recognising these plain and simple facts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2802">"Again, you say that you ask only for the Truth and yet you speak like a narrow and ignorant fanatic who refuses to believe in anything but the religion in which he was born. All fanaticism is false, because it is a contradiction of the very nature of God and of Truth. Truth cannot be shut up in a single book, Bible or Veda or Koran, or in a single religion. The Divine Being is eternal and universal and infinite and cannot be the sole property of the Mussulmans or of the Semitic religions only, – those that happened to be in a line from the Bible and to have Jewish or Arabian prophets for their founders. Hindus and Confucians and Taoists and all others have as much right to enter into relation with God and find the Truth in their own way. All religions have some truth in them, but none has the whole truth; all are created in time and finally decline and perish. Mahomed himself never pretended that the Koran was the last message of God and there would be no other.</p></blockquote>

You cannot shut up God in the limitations of your own narrow brain or dictate to the Divine Power and Consciousness how or where or through whom it shall manifest; you cannot put up your puny barriers against the divine Omnipotence. These again are simple truths which are now being recognised all over the world; only the childish in mind or those who vegetate in some formula of the past deny them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2804">"You have insisted on my writing and asked for the Truth and I have answered. But if you want to be a Mussulman, no one prevents you. If the Truth I bring is too great for you to understand or to bear, you are free to go and live in a half-truth or in your own ignorance. I am not here to convert anyone; I do not preach to the world to come to me and I call no one. I am here to establish the divine life and the divine consciousness in those who of themselves feel the call to come to me and cleave to it and in no others. I am not asking you and the Mother is not asking you to accept us. You can go any day and live either the worldly life or a religious life according to your own preference.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2866">It's interesting.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother goes within</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2867">You see, I am witnessing nature's transformation. When I have nothing to do and I sit very quiet, it's very clear. I see three things: the nature being transformed, or rather the new nature, what we can call the supramental way of seeing things (it's getting clearer and clearer; the memory of the old nature remains but is fading more and more, to such a point that sometimes it's almost incredible, it seems fantastic to have been like that). Then there's the physical deterioration that comes with age: for example, the physical inability to do what I used to do, the body getting old. But the aging is PURELY physical, I mean, I sit here all day long and have trouble moving about, things like that, but from the standpoint of perception, consciousness, there's no diminution. On the contrary, it's getting clearer and clearer and more and more precise. But, for instance, I have trouble speaking (<em>Mother touches her chest, she is out of breath</em>), it's hard for me to speak; I can't speak easily, it's hard. Things like that. That makes three things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2868">But when I am very quiet (at night, for instance), the new consciousness becomes clearer and clearer, but words cannot easily express it because... it's a kind of... (how shall I say?) it's almost as if a new mind were being formed (but not a mental one). And so speech, words... are a poor means, while the direct communication is getting more and more precise and strong. That's why I can't speak. It's purely physical. But the foundation of the physical poise, I mean the physical health, is changing, that is, it's being shifted: what used to be the condition of good health is practically gone; it is gradually replaced by another condition, but which isn't there yet; so everything is in... (<em>gesture of instability</em>), everything is no longer this, is not yet that. That's how it is. It's inexpressible. That's why I can't express myself.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 316</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2869">Interestingly enough, I notice it in my way of understanding things. For instance, what Sri Aurobindo wrote is VERY different.... It's a little as if, before, you used to see through a screen and, now, the screen is being lifted – it's not completely gone yet, but it's not completely there either.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2870">But, as you see, speaking makes me short of breath – without reason, simply because... because it's not natural anymore.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2871">And then, the way of perceiving time and space is becoming very different. It's completely changing. The notion of time and space, objectivity and subjectivity – whether things are concrete or not – all that seems to have been... <em>devices</em> for preparing the consciousness for a new way of being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2872">The functioning of the consciousness is beginning to be different. But I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2873">And then, for sight, for instance, sometimes I see more clearly with my eyes closed than with them open, and the vision is the SAME, physical, purely physical vision; but a physical that seems... more complete, I don't know what words to use. For instance, when I write; sometimes with my eyes closed I see what I write or see the same thing, but I see it... (what shall I say?... I could be wordy, but I don't like that). You know, it's as if what you see were more complete, yet it's the same thing, but containing more than the purely physical vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2874">I write <em>birthday</em> cards, and Sri Aurobindo.... I was about to say I have the feeling that Sri Aurobindo makes me write, but it's not like that, it's much better than that!... But when I start to write, for example, I close my eyes, and I see better what I am writing. Champaklal asks me to sign the cards, and he tells me that I sometimes write 3 or 4 cards in a row with my eyes completely closed, then my handwriting is much straighter and much more where the writing should be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2875">But there's no personal will involved, no personal effort, it's... it's spontaneous. So....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2876">And then, there is a kind of "something" that has been formed in the body to replace the mind, which is gone. This "something" has its mental ways of saying things, but it's very imperfect. For it,</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2877"> mental perceptions seem so thin, like a husk, the husk of something – so dry, with no real life behind them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2878">But the main trouble is in speaking (<em>Mother touches her chest</em>). I don't know, I have the same trouble eating. I don't think it's the result of age because I feel strong: I feel strength, it's not that I am tired, I don't at all feel tired – it's... a change. But then my age gives it a semblance of reason. Well (<em>laughing</em>) I don't know if it was these last few days (yesterday or the day before), all of a sudden I understood, as if Sri Aurobindo made me understand that it has come at this advanced age to give the semblance of reason, in order to... to assure me the utmost peace possible in my relations with people.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2879">I can't explain it.</p>

The Divine can give protection only to those who are whole-heartedly faithful to the Divine, who live truly in the spirit of sadhana and keep their consciousness and preoccupation fixed upon the Divine and the service of the Divine. Desire, for example, insistence on one's likes and conveniences, all movements of hypocrisy and insincerity and falsehood, are great obstacles standing in the way of the Divine's protection. If you seek to impose your will upon the Divine, it is as if you were calling for a bomb to fall upon you. I do not say that things are bound to happen in this way; but they are very likely to happen, if people do not become conscious and strictly vigilant and act in the true spirit of a spiritual seeker. If the psychological atmosphere remains the same as that of the outside world, there can be no wall of security against the dark Forces that are working out in it the ordeal of danger, suffering and destruction entering here."</p>

<p class="Ps">SRI AUROBINDO AND THE EARTH'S FUTURE</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2986">Sometimes a great wandering Thought sees the ages still unaccomplished, seizes the Force in its eternal flow and precipitates upon earth the powerful vision, which is like a power of realizing what it sees. The world is a vision becoming real. Indeed its past and its present are not the result of an obscure impulse coming from the womb of time, of a slow accumulation of sediments which little by little mold us – and stifle us and imprison us. It is the powerful golden attraction of the future which draws us in spite of ourselves, as the sun draws the lotus from the mud, and forces us to a glory greater than any our mud or efforts or present triumphs could have foreseen or created.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2987">Sri Aurobindo is this vision and this power of precipitating the future into the present. What he saw in an instant the ages and millions of men will unwittingly accomplish. Unknowingly they will seek the new imperceptible quiver that has entered the earth's atmosphere. From age to age great beings come amongst us to hew a great opening of Truth in the sepulchre of the past. And in actuality, these beings are the great destroyers of the past. They come with the sword of Knowledge to shatter our fragile empires.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2988">This year, we are celebrating Sri Aurobindo's Birth Centenary. He is known to barely a handful of men and yet his name will resound when the great men of today or yesterday are buried under their own debris. His work is discussed by philosophers, praised by poets, people acclaim his sociological vision and his yoga – but Sri Aurobindo is a living ACTION, a Word becoming real, and every day in the thousand circumstances that seem to want to rend the earth and topple its structures we can witness the first reflux of the Force he has set in motion. At the beginning of this century, when India was still struggling against British domination, Sri Aurobindo asserted: "It is not a revolt against the British Government [that is needed].... It is, in fact, a revolt against the whole universal Nature."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="93" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2989">For the problem is fundamental. It is not a question of bringing a new philosophy to the world or new ideas or illuminations, as they are called. The question is not of making the Prison of our lives more habitable, or of endowing man with ever more fantastic powers. Armed with his microscopes and telescopes, the human</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 328</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2990"> gnome remains a gnome, pain-ridden and helpless. We send rockets to the moon, but we know nothing of our own hearts. It is a question, says Sri Aurobindo, "of creating a new physical nature which is to be the habitation of the Supramental being in a new evolution."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="94" href="#">3</a> For, in actuality, he says, "the imperfection of Man is not the last word of Nature, but his perfection too is not the last peak of the Spirit."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">4</a> Beyond the mental man we are, there exists the possibility of another being who will be the spearhead of evolution as man was once the spearhead of evolution among the great apes. "If," says Sri Aurobindo, "the animal is a living laboratory in which Nature has, it is said, worked out man, man himself may well be a thinking and living laboratory in whom and with whose conscious co-operation she wills to work out the superman, the god."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="96" href="#">5</a> Sri Aurobindo has come to tell us how to create this other being, this supramental being, and not only to tell us but actually to create this other being and open the path of the future, to hasten upon earth the rhythm of evolution, the new vibration that will replace the mental vibration – exactly as a thought one day disturbed the slow routine of the beasts – and will give us the power to shatter the walls of our human prison.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2991">Indeed, the prison is already starting to collapse. "The end of a stage of evolution," announced by Sri Aurobindo, "is usually marked by a powerful recrudescence of all that has to go out of the evolution."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">6</a> Everywhere about us we see this paroxysmal shattering of all the old forms: our borders, our churches, our laws, our morals are collapsing on all sides. They are not collapsing because we are bad, immoral, irreligious, or because we are not sufficiently rational, scientific or human, but because we have come to the end of the human! To the end of the old mechanism – for we are on our way to SOMETHING ELSE. The world is not going through a moral crisis but through an "evolutionary crisis." We are not going towards a better world – nor, for that matter, towards a worse one – we are in the midst of a MUTATION to a radically different world, as different as the human world was from the ape world of the Tertiary Era. We are entering a new era, a supramental Quinary. We leave our countries, wander aimlessly, we go looking for drugs, for adventure, we go on strike here, enact reforms there, foment revolutions and counterrevolutions. But all</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 329</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2992"> this is only an appearance; in fact, unwittingly, we are looking for the new being. We are in the midst of human evolution.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2993">And Sri Aurobindo gives us the key. It may be that the sense of our own revolution escapes us because we try to prolong that which already exists, to refine it, improve it, sublimate it. But the ape may have made the same mistake amid its revolution that produced man; perhaps it sought to become a super-ape, better equipped to climb trees, hunt and run, a more agile and clever ape. With Nietzsche we too sought a "superman" who was nothing more than a colossalization of man, and with the spiritualists a super-saint more richly endowed with virtue and wisdom. But human virtue and wisdom are useless! Even when carried to their highest heights they are nothing more than the old poverties gilded over, the obverse of our tenacious misery. "Supermanhood," says Sri Aurobindo, "is not man climbed to his own natural zenith, not a superior degree of human greatness, knowledge, power, intelligence, will,... genius,... saintliness, love, purity or perfection."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="98" href="#">7</a> It is SOMETHING ELSE, another vibration of being, another consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2994">But if this new consciousness is not to be found on the peaks of the human, where then, are we to find it? Perhaps, quite simply in that which we have most neglected since we entered the mental cycle, in the body. The body is our base, our evolutionary foundation, the old stock to which we always return, and which painfully compels our attention by making us suffer, age and die. "In that imperfection," Sri Aurobindo assures us, "is the urge towards a higher and more many-sided perfection. It contains the last finite which yet yearns to the Supreme Infinite.... God is pent in the mire... but the very fact imposes a necessity to break through that prison."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">8</a> That is the old, uncured Illness, the unchanged root, the dark matrix of our misery, hardly different now from what it was in the time of Lemuria. It is this physical substance which we must transform, otherwise it will topple, one after another, all the human or superhuman devices we try to graft on it. This body, this physical cellular substance contains "almighty powers,"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">9</a> a dumb consciousness that harbors all the lights and all the infinitudes, just as much as the mental and spiritual immensities do. For, in truth, all is Divine and unless the Lord of all the universe resides in a single little cell he resides nowhere. It is this</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 330</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2995"> original, dark cellular Prison which we must break open; for as long as we have not broken it, we will continue to turn vainly in the golden or iron circles of our mental prison. "These laws of Nature," says Sri Aurobindo, "that you call absolute... merely mean an equilibrium established to work in order to produce certain results. But, if you change the consciousness, then the groove also is bound to change."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="101" href="#">10</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2996">Such is the new adventure to which Sri Aurobindo invites us, an adventure into man's unknown. Whether we like it or not, the whole earth is moving into a new groove, but why shouldn't we like it? Why shouldn't we collaborate in this great, unprecedented adventure? Why shouldn't we collaborate in our own evolution, instead of repeating endlessly the same old story, instead of chasing hallucinatory paradises which will never quench our thirst or otherworldly paradises which leave the earth to rot along with our bodies? "Why be born if it is to get out at the end?" exclaims the Mother, who continues Sri Aurobindo's work. "What is the use of having struggled so much, suffered so much, of having created something which, in its outer appearance at least, is so tragic and dramatic, if it is only to learn how to get out of it – it would have been better not to start at all.... Evolution is not a tortuous course that brings us back, somewhat battered, to the starting point. Quite the contrary, it is meant," says Mother, "to teach the whole of creation the joy of being, the beauty of being, the grandeur of being, the majesty of a sublime life, and the perpetual development, perpetually progressive, of this joy, this beauty, this grandeur. Then everything has a meaning."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">11</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2997">This body, this obscure beast of burden we inhabit, is the experimental field of Sri Aurobindo's yoga – which is a yoga of the whole earth, for one can easily understand that if a single being among our millions of sufferings succeeds in negotiating the evolutionary leap, the mutation of the next age, the face of the earth will be radically altered. Then all the so-called powers of which we boast today will seem like childish games before the radiance of this almighty embodied spirit. Sri Aurobindo tells us that it is possible – not only possible but that it will be done. It is being done. And perhaps everything depends not so much on a sublime effort of humanity to transcend its limitations – for that means</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 331</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-2998"> still using our own human strength to free ourselves from human strength – as on a call, a conscious cry of the earth to this new being which the earth already carries within itself. All is already there, within our hearts, the supreme Source which is the supreme Power – only we must call it into our forest of cement, we must understand the meaning of man, the meaning of ourselves. The amplified cry of the earth, of its millions of men and women who cannot bear it anymore, who no longer accept their prison, must open a crack to let the new vibration in.

<p class="p-num">Page 336</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3053">Well, for some time there's been much more insistence on personal transformation than on creation, for you. I have seen that.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3054"><em>So, I shouldn't worry?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3055">No, not at all. On the contrary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3056">Really, to put it childishly, the Divine Wisdom is far greater than ours. I perceive that constantly. We have a very short view of things – very short and limited. While the Divine Wisdom is.... You get such a feeling of not knowing anything when you compare your way of seeing to the Divine's way of seeing (I am putting it rather childishly).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3057"><em>Yes, but practically, there are two possible attitudes with respect to the creative force: either to be completely passive and wait (but then, isn't that passivity simply a kind of inertia?), or else do as those who create do, that is, call the Force and pull it down. In other words, they actively intervene to create.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3058">There is a third attitude. It's the best. To be very attentive; rather than being passive and inert, to be very attentive and alert. And then, to feel when the Impulsion to do something comes, and to do it. I have put that into practice these last few days, and that's the solution. You see, the difficulty lies in having action WITHOUT the personal limitations – they are inextricably bound up in our consciousness, and the passivity you speak of is there to separate the two; but once you have... I don't know, the perception or sensation of the state in which you are completely open to the Divine Impulsion, then you can allow action to take place again. And that is the solution.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3059">It's very difficult to explain, but I've had the experience recently (yesterday or the day before, it's very recent), the experience of an attitude of unmixed receptivity – unmixed with any personal activity – an activity whose impulse comes only from the Divine (I had this in connection with the war, the current events, and that's how I understood).

A federation of the states of India along the lines of The Ideal of Human Unity, as conceived and explained by Sri Aurobindo. And the conversion of the United States is in the same idea, just according to Sri Aurobindo's revelation. But that will take time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3061">It came in an imperative way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3062">Also I heard something Sri Aurobindo wrote, where he says that in order for the Supermind to manifest on earth, the physical mind has to receive and manifest it. And the physical mind, I mean the bodily mind, mine, is precisely the only one I have left now. And so it came to me very clearly that that is why that one alone was left. And it is being converted very rapidly and interestingly. The physical mind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="110" href="#">3</a> is developing under the supramental influence.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3069">That way it's possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3070"><em>But it has to be pretty radical.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3071">But it is radical, mon petit! You can't imagine, it's like.... I could really say I've become another person. Only this (<em>Mother indicates the appearance of her body</em>) is still like this, the same as it was.... To what extent will it be able to change? Sri Aurobindo said that if the physical mind is transformed, the body's transformation will follow quite NATURALLY. We'll see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3072">But could you give me a key or a lever to effect the radical change?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3073">Ah, I don't know, because for me everything was simply taken away – the mind is completely gone. If you like, in appearance I had become an idiot, I didn't know anything. And it's the physical mind that developed, slowly, slowly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3074">In my case, I don't know, the work was done for me – I did nothing. That's how it was done, very radically. It could be done because I was VERY conscious of my psychic (the psychic being which was formed through all the lives), I was very conscious of it, and it remained; it remained and enabled me to deal with people without its making any difference, thanks to that psychic presence. That's why there were very few apparent changes. So I can speak only of what I know, and I'll say this: the psychic has to remain very much in command of the whole being – the whole bodily being – guiding the life, then the mind has time to be transformed. Mine was simply sent away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3075">You see, the transformation of the bodily mind was indispensable because that's the only one I had left, you follow?... Very few people would accept that. (<em>Laughing</em>) In my case, it was done without asking my opinion! The work was very easy.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3089">You see, the body has given itself entirely. It even said to the Divine, "I beg You to make me want my dissolution if I must die," so that EVEN THERE I won't offer any resistance, should it be necessary for this body to die – to want my dissolution.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3090"> came a sort of... (I could put it into words, but it wasn't words): "If you accept suffering and discomfort, transformation is better than dissolution." And so when it feels uncomfortable, it accepts.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3092">And for each one obviously it must be different.... For me it was very radical – I didn't have any choice, you understand: it was like that, and that's that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3093">But we truly have to.... What made things easy is that the psychic consciousness was completely in the forefront and ruling the life, so it just went on quietly without being concerned with the rest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3094">It's like sight and hearing, I've noticed that it's not a physical deterioration: it's simply that I understand and hear people only when they think clearly what they say. And I see only what is... what expresses the inner life, otherwise things are... hazy or veiled. It's not that my eyes don't see, it's "something," it's something else – everything is new.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3095">It was what Sri Aurobindo told me when I asked to leave (we both knew one of us had to go); I immediately said to him, "I will go." And he said no, he told me, "Your body is much more capable than mine of bearing the work of transformation." Sri Aurobindo told me that. And so it accepted, but....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3096">It's true, the body has to be VERY goodwilled – it so happens that mine is; and it's not a mental goodwill, of course, it's really a bodily goodwill. It accepts, it accepts all the drawbacks.... But the attitude is important, not the consequences (I am convinced that the drawbacks are not indispensable), it's the attitude that is important. It has to be like this (<em>gesture of open hands</em>), you see. Truly I have noticed that in most cases, surrender to the Divine does not mean trust in the Divine – because when you surrender to the Divine, you say, "Even if You make me suffer, I surrender," but that's an absolute lack of trust! That's really amusing, surrender DOES NOT IMPLY trust; trust is something else, it's... a kind of knowledge – an <em>unshakable</em> knowledge, which nothing can disturb – it's WE who change into difficulties, suffering, misery what is... perfect peace in the Divine Consciousness. It's we who create that little "transformation."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3144">More and more I am convinced that we have a way of receiving things and reacting to them that CREATES difficulties – I am more and more convinced of it. Because, for example, I have rather unpleasant physical and material experiences about food. You know that for a very long time now I have completely stopped being hungry (I eat only to be reasonable, because "one must" eat, otherwise...), and I have some small difficulty in swallowing, or breathing (ridiculous things), but everything changes depending on whether you pay attention to them or not, depending on an attitude like this (<em>gesture of being focused on oneself</em>) in which you watch yourself living, or an attitude in which you're (<em>vast gesture</em>) in things, in movement, in life; and a third attitude in which you pay attention only to the Divine. If you succeed in being like that all the time, there are no difficulties – and yet things are the same. That's the experience: the thing in itself is as it is, but it is our reaction to it that differs. The experience is more and more conclusive. You see, there are three categories: our attitude with respect to things, the things in themselves (those two always give you trouble), and there is a third category in which everything, but everything is in regard to the Divine, in the Consciousness of the Divine – all is marvelous, all is easy! And I am speaking of material things, of the material, physical life (for psychological things, we've known it for long), I mean material things like little discomforts of the body, or reactions, feeling pain or not, circumstances going wrong, not being able to swallow your dinner – the most banal things you don't pay attention to when you're young and strong and in good health (you don't pay any attention to them, and it's like that for everyone), but when you live in the consciousness of your body and what happens to it and its ways of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 346</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3145"> receiving things that come and so on – oh, it's misery! When you live in the consciousness of others, of what they want, what they need, their relationship with you – it's misery! But if you live in the Divine Presence and it's the Divine who does everything, sees everything, is everything... it's Peace – it's Peace, time has no duration, everything is easy and.... Not that you feel joy or feel... it's not so... it's the Divine who is there. And it's the ONLY solution. That's where the world is going: the Consciousness of the Divine – the Divine who does, the Divine who is, the Divine.... So then, the same IDENTICAL circumstance (I am not speaking of different circumstances), the same IDENTICAL circumstance (it's my experience these last few days, so concrete, you know, so concrete); day before yesterday I was sick as a dog, and yesterday circumstances were the same, my body was in the same state, all was the same and yet... all was peaceful.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3153">It's like death, you see. The phenomenon is transitional, but seems to us to have existed forever (it's forever for us because our consciousness is like this – <em>Mother draws a little square in the air</em>), but when you have that divine consciousness, oh!... things become almost instantaneous, you understand. I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3154">There IS movement, there IS progression, there IS what is translated for us by time, that exists, it's something... something</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3157">Yes, that's it. That's right. But for me it is an experience. Not something I "think" (I don't think), but an experience. And hard to explain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3158">And its effect on us, the sensation it produces in us depends exclusively on the position of our consciousness. There is the consciousness of being in oneself or being in the whole (being in the whole is already a bit better than being egoistically oneself, and it has its advantages and disadvantages, but it's not the truth), the Truth is... the Divine as totality – totality in time and totality in space. And that consciousness, the body CAN have, because this body had it (momentarily, for a few moments), and while it has it, everything is so... you see, it's not joy, it's not pleasure, it's not happiness, nothing of all that... a sort of blissful peace... and luminous... and creative. Magnificent. Only, it comes and goes, comes and goes.... And when you go out of it, you have the impression of falling into a horrible pit – our ordinary consciousness (I mean the ordinary human consciousness) is a horrible pit. But we also know why it had to be momentarily that way, for it was necessary in order to go from this to that: everything that happens is necessary for the full development of the goal of creation. You could say (we could word-paint): the goal of creation is for the creature to become conscious as the Creator. There you are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3159">It's word-painting, but it's in that direction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_3-3160">This creation's goal is that Consciousness of the Infinite, the Eternal, which is omnipotent – Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent (which our religions have called God: for us, with respect to life, it's the Divine) – Infinite and Eternal, All-Powerful... outside of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 348</p>

And when I am in the true consciousness, the moment I am in the true consciousness, the number of years is nothing! – The body feels so young, so full of... something else than young (for it, young is <em>immature</em> and ignorant, it's not that), it's... you're in communion with "something"... which changes according to the need.</p>
