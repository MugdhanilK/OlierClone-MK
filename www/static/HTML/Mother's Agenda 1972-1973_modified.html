<h2>Mother‚Äôs Agenda</h2>
<h2>1972-1973</h2>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document  ‚Äî  6,000 pages in 13 volumes  ‚Äî  is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death  ‚Äî  upon the very power that changes death  ‚Äî  and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="Pi" style="text-align: center;"><em>The Last Path</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>As I begin this thirteenth volume, I look once again.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>One morning in 1956, twenty-five years ago, Mother was telling me her first vision of the supramental world. She was seated in a tall straight-backed chair of carved wood that reminded me of Egypt, reminded me of so many other times before lost in forgotten ages. This was the first time this time that she was telling me about the fantastic adventure ‚Äî the "transformation," the "new species‚Äù ‚Äî and it seemed so familiar and yet was the same old mystery. During these last twenty-five years hardly an hour has gone by ‚Äî and now hardly a minute or a second ‚Äî without my poring over that Mystery. Twenty-five years is a lot of minutes in a man‚Äôs life. And now, on this day of the year nineteen hundred and eighty-one, on this fifteenth of May, I look at it once more ‚Äî it has become very burning. I look through the veil of that "stupid death,‚Äù as she called it, I look at what is no longer visible to our physical eye and yet throbs with a compelling presence ‚Äî how I wish I could take that cool hand again, so soft and yet so strong, and say: WHAT IS IT?</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>What is it?</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>It's so familiar, and yet totally unknown. All that the mind can know is known and yet nothing is known. All her words have been lived with almost excruciating intensity, understood from the depths of the soul, from the depths of a thousand lives spent tracking down the same secret, the same question, and yet nothing is understood. In the end, there remains only love, that's all. But there remains also this WHAT IS IT? Perhaps not so much personally as for the earth: what is it? For all this pain-racked humanity. The earth is indeed very miserable. Perhaps she is even at the end of her rope.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>The day after she left, eight years ago, I scribbled two lines on a scrap of blue paper: "She left so that we would find something.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>"We," human beings, that is.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>I did not believe in death, not for a single second of those nineteen years spent near her, up till the very last day I did not believe in it ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt even occur to me she could leave. That morning of November 18, 1973, I was thunderstruck ‚Äî numb, like a stone. Profoundly mute. And that intense question which has not left me since. A wordless question. Something burning within, like love, like the whole question of the earth. What is it?</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 12</p>
<p class="Pi"><em>Find what?... The passage?</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>I have plumbed each of her words for a clue, I have lived since then in the powerful vibration that enveloped her small white frame and extended far, far away into an infinity of snow and fire. Each second, perhaps, of these eight years, with each look, I have pored over an indefinable something. I have even written books, written again and again in an attempt to ferret out the mystery ‚Äî in a transparent, suspended breath, so terribly still, I have tried to capture the pure little vibration, the slightest ripple from beyond that would fall upon the mirror of my soul and reveal the secret: the passage, the process.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>But the only answer I got was a mounting flame. A mounting question. More and more infinity packed into one burning point. Like an imploding star.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>It was a simple prayer ‚Äî wordless, pure. A prayer for the pain of the earth. A prayer for the beauty of the earth.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>Once again I am going to follow Mother‚Äôs last path, her halting little breath ‚Äî 1972-1973 ‚Äî wade upstream to the source of that pure little prayer, as if to the farthest reaches of love and death, and... I don't know, but something tells me that the earth will find it ‚Äî this time the earth will find her own secret. Precisely there where nothing is left but love or death.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>But only at that point.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>We are being led, the entire earth is being led to LIVE that: to the point where all of a sudden the secret will come alive.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>An hour of fire and prayer when nothing is left but "that."</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>Mother‚Äôs Agenda is perhaps simply that prayer coming alive ‚Äî and we are in the secret... without knowing it. We will know it only when we have passed through death without dying from it.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>For the hour WILL come when the earth stands on the threshold.</em></p>
<p class="Pi"><em>At the farthest reaches of love, death will vanish into an earthly glory.</em></p>

There's nothing, there's no "me" here; it's only... (<em>gesture of something flowing through Mother</em>) the Force flowing.

<p class="P"><em>No, not that. I feel the Power, but... if I could feel something more in the heart, you understand, something more... intimate, something more vivid, less impersonal as a matter of fact.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, that! Yes, I agree. But everything tends to insist on that impersonalization.</p>
<p class="P">In my consciousness it is like a transitional condition (not a final condition, a transitional one) required to attain immortality. That's what it is. There is something ‚Äì something to be found. But what, I don't know.</p>

The Mother</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Recently, between your last visit and this one (two or three days ago), I suddenly had a revelation of the purpose of creation ‚Äì what it signifies and the why of it: the meaning of creation. It was so clear! So clear. The vision of its reason and where we are going ‚Äì simply impossible to describe it in words.</p>
<p class="P">Some words came (<em>Mother shows Satprem a piece of paper</em>), but then they had a very special meaning. Here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">The result of creation is a detailed multiplication of consciousness. When the vision of the whole and the vision of all the details join together within an active consciousness, the creation will have attained its progressive perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="P">"Progressive" means... (<em>expanding gesture</em>). No word, no image can convey the experience. It was a real comprehension, a real vision of the thing. This (<em>Mother points to her note</em>) seems hollow in comparison. To use a very childlike metaphor, it's as if the creation unfolded on a screen, were projected on a screen. Or rather, the Supreme Consciousness is projecting itself on a sort of infinite screen.</p>
<p class="P">The experience was... it was obviousness itself! That was IT. But it lasted only a moment. Then, I tried to put it in words. And these words had meaning, a special meaning.</p>
<p class="P">To a child, you could say that the Supreme unfolds himself before his own consciousness, like someone unreeling an endless film. He projects what is here (<em>gesture pointing within, at heart level</em>), in front of him, like that. And since the supramental being would have the capacity to be consciously one with the Divine, he would at once be the seer and the seen.</p>
<p class="P">There are just no words to say it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence<br/>

</blockquote>
<p class="P">No that's not it.</p>
<p class="P">I wrote something, or rather I told Sri Aurobindo, who wrote down what the twelve petals were (the four petals are the four main aspects of the Mother, and the twelve are the twelve qualities or "virtues" of the Mother, her powers). I said it one day, and Sri Aurobindo wrote it down; that's when we were living in the other</p>

<p class="P"><em>But don't those twelve gardens correspond to the twelve qualities you mentioned?</em></p>
<p class="P">No, no. No, I wrote it at least twenty-five years ago, at the very least ‚Äì oh, even more than that! I don't remember when we moved here, when was it?...</p>
<p class="P"><em>In 1927... forty-five years ago!</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>They must be Mahakali, Maheshwari, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasaraswati.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but I don't mean the popular deities. Sri Aurobindo gave each one a special significance.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, you mean what he wrote in "The Mother."</em></p>

As if it gave you the power. And then it left.</p>
<p class="P">I remember when I wrote the note, the words had a special meaning for me, a depth they don't usually have. Well....</p>

<p class="P"><em>Of course!</em></p>
<p class="P">That's not how it works. I am as though bathed in it and start seeing... I don't know. It isn't something I "see" (something foreign to me that I see), it's... suddenly I AM it. There's no longer any person, any.... I can't find words to describe these experiences.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Yes, of course! When you talk with me, for instance, well, I feel the whole world of consciousness behind, your words are merely a prop for all that I sense in the background, which you make me perceive.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p class="P"><em>So obviously, when there's nothing but words on paper, a whole depth is gone.</em></p>

<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I remember, the experience is still very vivid. As I told you, T.J. has a very childish consciousness, so I said to her: you see, it's as if the Whole (not the Divine separate from the creation: the Whole) projected itself on a screen in order to see itself. Therefore it's infinite, it's "forever" ‚Äì it's never the same and it never ends. It's like a projection to visualize the details and be conscious of oneself in another way.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7" href="#">8</a></p>
<p class="P">The metaphor is quite childlike, of course, but very evocative ‚Äì that's how I saw it then. Exactly the impression of an infinite Whole projecting itself endlessly.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother remains absorbed a long time</em>)</p>
<p class="P">For instance, the memory mechanism is gone, but I feel it's on purpose. My vision of things would be much less spontaneous and sincere (possibly) if I remembered.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, I get it.</em></p>
<p class="P">Things always come as a new revelation ‚Äì and not in the same manner.</p>
<p class="P">That's it ‚Äì you BECOME the thing, you become it. You don't "see" it; it's not something you see or understand or know, it's... something you ARE.</p>
<p class="P">When I had that experience of the world, it was the experience itself, conscious of itself. It wasn't something I "knew," it was something that WAS.</p>

top group red, passing to orange towards yellow.</p>

I saw why people are insincere (even when they make an effort): because now it's one part, now the other, now yet another part of them that asserts itself; each part is quite sincere in its own assertion, but is in disaccord with the others.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But that means the psychic consciousness must penetrate the PHYSICAL consciousness.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because that's the only place where there is permanence.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes....</p>
<p class="P"><em>The psychic consciousness must penetrate the ordinary physical consciousness.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>That's what is difficult!</em></p>
<p class="P">But, mon petit, I tell you, that's what happened to me at least thirty years ago.</p>
<p class="P">The psychic consciousness has always been there, controlling and guiding the being. All the impressions, everything was referred to it, like this (<em>gesture of placing something before a spotlight</em>), so it would give the true direction. And the physical, for its part, is sort of constantly attentive to the Divine Command.</p>
<p class="P">And that was constant, constant ‚Äì even BEFORE coming here. It was so when I arrived here (long, long ago). And it has remained unchanged. Only recently did I have the experience [of the nonunified consciousness], for a few hours one night, two or three hours ‚Äì it was horrible, really, it seemed like hell. It was to make me touch, to make me grasp the condition people live in. Imagine when the psychic is no longer there....</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 59</p>
<p class="P">But it's in the BODY ‚Äì in the body: the body is listening, listening, constantly listening (<em>gesture above or within</em>) ‚Äì listening. But [the Divine Command] is not expressed in words, it comes as a will asserting itself (<em>a straight and imperturbable descending gesture</em>).</p>
<p class="P">Should I add something to make it clearer?</p>
<p class="P"><em>You said, "The complete unification of the whole being."</em></p>
<p class="P">So that means the physical, too.</p>
<p class="P">People never understand anything. But it's perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, yes!</em></p>
<p class="P">So you think it's all right?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, certainly!</em></p>
<p class="P">I think it's important, because it came as an experience, precisely to make me grasp its importance.</p>
<p class="P">We must put: "Message for the 21st."</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. We need another one for the 29th, too.</em></p>
<p class="P">February 29th, what's that?</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's the fourth anniversary of the supramental descent, in '56.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh! It was the 29th....</p>
<p class="P"><em>The 29th, in 1956... sixteen years ago.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother smiles and remains absorbed</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Could we say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">It is only when the supramental manifests in the physical mind that its presence can be permanent.</p>

<p class="P">Do you think it will do?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother!</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 60</p>
<p class="P">We should say "in the body-mind."</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, we could add "and body-mind": in the physical mind and body-mind...?</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>So simply "body-mind."</em></p>
<p class="P">Is it enough, then?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, we have both messages now.</em></p>
<p class="P">So they're expecting me to go out on the balcony. I am going out on the balcony only for the 21st.... What have you heard? What are people expecting?</p>
<p class="P"><em>They're expecting to see as much of you as possible!(Laughter)</em></p>
<p class="P">I don't know. The 29th is just one week later.... It's a big strain ‚Äì not a strain, but a difficulty.</p>
<p class="P"><em>What if everyone passed in front of you, would that be more difficult?</em></p>
<p class="P">Ohh... two flights of stairs to climb! It used to be possible down in the garden, but two flights of stairs....</p>
<p class="P"><em>But people can move along more easily now, they've built new stairways. It's really up to you: wouldn't it be more tiring to sit there while so many people file past?</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, I think it would be too much.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, it would be too long for you.</em></p>
<p class="P">And it isn't very practical here: they would have to leave through the same door they come in. There should be another exit, then people could make a circle.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="P"><em>But will you give a meditation on the 29th?</em></p>
<p class="P">All right, I don't mind. Let's have a meditation at 10 a.m., then.</p>
<p class="P"><em>You wouldn't want to go out on the balcony a second time by any chance? [Laughter]</em></p>
<p class="P">That would be a bit too much.</p>
<p class="P">The body is no longer quite on this side, you see, and not yet on the other, so it lives in a kind of precarious balance, and the slightest thing upsets it ‚Äì I can't swallow anymore or even breathe anymore.... The feeling of a life which is about to depend on different conditions than the usual ones. But those other conditions aren't there yet, nor is the body familiar with them, and so the transition from one state to the other is a perpetual source of problems. When I am very quiet ‚Äì very quiet ‚Äì everything is fine, but if there's the slightest effort, everything goes awry.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother gasps for breath</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You see how it is.</p>

<p class="P">I think... I have the feeling that if all goes well, in a few years I'll be able to do many things... but not yet.

The body itself has a conviction that if it lasts till one hundred, then at one hundred it will have a new strength and a new life. But... these are just the difficult years.</p>
<p class="P">The years of transition... (<em>Mother puts her head in her hands</em>).</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>brief silence</em>)</p>

<p class="P">That's not my opinion at all! I think it would be far better to publish "The Synthesis of Yoga" than "The Ideal."</p>
<p class="P"><em>"The Synthesis" first?</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes. There's a difference of level between the two.</p>

At this point the main question is to know whether we shouldn't try to raise money, to ask people in the world for personal contributions in rupees, francs or dollars, so that Auroville can be built by individual people. Perhaps some action along those lines could be undertaken in various countries as well as in India? Because Auroville's financial situation is getting worse. It's worse than it was six months ago, and the needs are increasing, so... I don't know, waiting may be a solution, but you should know the exact situation.</em></p>

<p class="P">What can we do? Do you have a suggestion?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Some time back, L. [an Indian industrialist] came up with an idea which I would like to discuss further with him. The idea was to interest individuals, give them a sort of participation in Auroville. I don't exactly know what India's financial situation is, but....</em></p>
<p class="P">India's financial situation is VERY bad. Because they used to receive a lot of money from America, but that has practically stopped. It's very bad ‚Äì India has become poor, that's the trouble. Otherwise we could ask, but they are really in trouble.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Perhaps some other countries are ready to help.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, certainly!</p>

<p class="P">Yes, yes!</p>
<p class="P"><em>We should try.</em></p>
<p class="P">If only I were given a plan. I haven't seen to these things so far, but if there were an acceptable plan, I could work on it. Right now I don't know what to do.</p>

<p class="P">I think something should be done. But I can't say what because I don't know ‚Äì I don't know what can be done practically.</p>
<p class="P">For many, many years, I had merely to exert a little pressure to get money ‚Äì and I got it. But that was for the Ashram. Now the Ashram doesn't have enough, and nothing comes no matter how much pressure I exert ‚Äì people no longer know where to give: there's this thing and that thing, and this and that... they are confused!</p>

<p class="P"><em>You no longer know where you stand: there's "Sri Aurobindo Society," "Sri Aurobindo's Action," "Sri Aurobindo this and that...." The result is dispersion.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, but when you tell them that ‚Äì especially if you put it that way to N. [<em>Sri Aurobindo Society</em>], he'll say, "All right, Sri Aurobindo's Action [U.'s operation] has got to go." Each one says, "I am the one who should stay!"... That's no solution.</p>
<p class="P"><em>The solution is that people should become one, Mother: unity.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, yes, yes ‚Äì yes, exactly. Exactly!</p>
<p class="P">Instead of a combination where each one has his place within a harmonious unity, instead of that, everyone pulls in his own direction. The real progress to be made is a moral one.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 86</p>
<p class="P">You have hit the point: lack of unity is the cause of all the difficulties.</p>
<p class="P">Now even the Ashram has been contaminated by the disease: each department considers itself a separate entity. And since there's no more cohesion, nothing works! That's the situation.</p>
<p class="P">And I can no longer go from one place to another and bring a vigorous action. I can't anymore, I am held here.</p>
<p class="P">That's it, you've put your finger on it. If you could propose a specific plan of action, we could see. That's what is needed: to coordinate the efforts and create a unity with the parts.</p>
<p class="P">From the beginning there has been this lack of unity, and also because of the action I no longer perform. No matter how much I tell them, "You are not here to represent your own interests. You are all one and the same" ‚Äì they just don't understand! So the result is (<em>laughing</em>): N. is sick and U. doesn't feel well ‚Äì there you are.</p>
<p class="P">In the end it always boils down to the same thing: a SUBSTANTIAL individual progress is required ‚Äì a serious and sincere progress ‚Äì then everything works perfectly.</p>
<p class="P">The atmosphere is dislocated; it has lost the cohesive power it had.</p>
<p class="P">But if you want to collaborate, it would be wonderful, you know! I need someone, you see, someone who could get around, talk to people, see, take notes: reestablish unity on a higher level. oh, that would be a wonderful work! Wonderful.</p>
<p class="P">Once that is done, things would ease up. It's not that money is lacking, it's just being wasted, scattered.</p>
<p class="P">You see, N. keeps wanting to expand and expand the <em>Sri Aurobindo Society</em>, he buys plots of land worth lakhs of rupees, and instead of the money being used for the general work, it is frittered away....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="22" href="#">1</a> I told him, but he didn't understand.

<p class="p-num">Page 98</p>
<p class="P"><em>Sujata told me about the experience you had the other day, that vision you had of your body, the transitional body.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, I WAS like that. It was me; I didn't look at myself in a mirror, I saw myself like this (<em>Mother bends her head to look at her body</em>), I was... I just was like that.</p>
<p class="P">That's the first time. It was around four in the morning, I think. And perfectly natural ‚Äì I mean, I didn't look in a mirror, it felt perfectly natural. I only remember what I saw (<em>gesture from the chest to the waist</em>). I was covered only with veils, so I only saw.... What was very different was the torso, from the chest to the waist: it was neither male nor female.</p>
<p class="P">But it was lovely, my form was extremely svelte and slim ‚Äì slim but not thin. And the skin was very white, just like my skin. A lovely form. And no sex ‚Äì you couldn't tell: neither male nor female. The sex had disappeared.</p>
<p class="P">The same here (<em>Mother points to her chest</em>), all that was flat. I don't know how to explain it. There was an outline reminiscent of what is now, but with no forms (<em>Mother touches her chest</em>), not even as much as a man's. A very white skin, very smooth. Practically no abdomen to speak of. And no stomach. All that was slim.</p>
<p class="P">I didn't pay any special attention, you see, because I was that: it felt perfectly natural to me. That's the first time it happened, it was the night before last; but last night I didn't see anything. That was the first and the last time so far.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But this form is in the subtle physical, isn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P">It must be already like that in the subtle physical.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But how will it pass into the physical?</em></p>
<p class="P">That's the question I don't know.... I don't know.</p>
<p class="P">I don't know.</p>
<p class="P">Also, clearly there was none of the complex digestion we have now, or the kind of elimination we have now. It didn't work that way.</p>
<p class="P">But how?... Food is already obviously very different and becoming more and more so ‚Äì glucose, for instance, or substances that don't require an elaborate digestion. But how will the body itself change?... That I don't know. I don't know.</p>
<p class="P">You see, I didn't look to see how it worked, for it was completely</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 99</p>
<p class="P"> natural to me, so I can't describe it in detail. Simply, it was neither a woman's body nor a man's ‚Äì that much is certain. And <em>the outline</em> was fairly similar to that of a very young person. There was a faint suggestion of a human form (<em>Mother draws a form in the air</em>): with a shoulder and a waist. Just a hint of it.</p>
<p class="P">I see it but.... I saw it exactly as you see yourself, I didn't even look at myself in the mirror. And I had a sort of veil, which I wore to cover myself.</p>
<p class="P">It was my way of being (there was nothing surprising in it), my natural way of being.</p>
<p class="P">That must be how it is in the subtle physical.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But what's mysterious is the transition from one to the other.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes ‚Äì how?</p>
<p class="P">But it's the same mystery as the transition from chimpanzee to man.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, no, Mother! It's more colossal than that! It's more colossal for, after all, there isn't that much difference between a chimpanzee and a man.</em></p>
<p class="P">But there wasn't such a difference in the appearance either (<em>Mother draws a form in the air</em>): there were shoulders, arms, legs, a body, a waist. Similar to ours. There was only....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, but I mean the way a chimpanzee functions and the way a man functions are the same.</em></p>
<p class="P">They are the same.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, yes! They digest the same, breathe the same.... Whereas here....</em></p>
<p class="P">No, but here too there must have been breathing. The shoulders were strikingly broad (<em>gesture</em>), in contrast. That's important. But the chest was neither feminine nor even masculine: only reminiscent of it. And all that ‚Äì stomach, abdomen and the rest ‚Äì was simply an <em>outline</em>, a very slender and harmonious form, which certainly wasn't used for the purpose we now use our bodies.</p>
<p class="P">The two different things ‚Äì totally different ‚Äì were procreation, which was no longer possible, and food. Though even our present</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 100</p>
<p class="P"> food is manifestly not the same as that of chimpanzees or even the first humans; it's quite different. So now, it seems we have to find a food that doesn't require all this digesting.... Not exactly liquid, but not solid either. And there's also the question of the mouth ‚Äì I don't know about that ‚Äì and the teeth? Naturally, chewing should no longer be necessary, and therefore teeth wouldn't be either.... But there has to be something to replace them. I haven't the slightest idea what the face looked like. But it didn't seem too, too unlike what it is now.</p>
<p class="P">What will change a great deal, of course ‚Äì it had acquired a prominent role ‚Äì is breathing. That being depended much on it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, he probably absorbs energies directly.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes. There will probably be intermediary beings who won't last, you see, just as there were intermediary beings between the chimpanzee and man.</p>

<p class="P">Your reply to the questions of a Swedish magazine regarding "whether religions have in fact promoted the conditions of tolerance and understanding among men" happened to fall into my hands just as I have started giving a series of lectures on your works at the "International University Center" of Sri Aurobindo Ashram. This coincidence, along with a long-standing familiarity with your books, prompt me to write you a few words about another testimony, that of Sri Aurobindo, which I am sure you are aware of, but whose work, still incompletely translated in French, remains poorly known in Europe.</p>
<p class="P">I seem to find in Sri Aurobindo's work an answer that meets yours and develops it ‚Äì for the question is indeed to "reinstate the gods IN man" after having reinstated the demons, as you rightly stated in the Swedish article ‚Äì but I also find there an answer to the agonizing question constantly raised by your characters from <em>The Royal Way to The Walnut Trees of Altenburg</em>. Indeed, all of them seek a "deeper notion in man" that will deliver them from death and solitude ‚Äì this is THE question of the West, to which Sri Aurobindo brings a solution at once dynamic and illuminating. Hence, I am taking the liberty of sending by surface mail one of Sri Aurobindo's books in the original English entitled <em>The Human Cycle</em>. I hope it will interest you.</p>
<p class="P">I call on you rather than any other contemporary writer because I think your works embody the very anguish of the West, an anguish I have bitterly experienced all the way to the German concentration camps at the age of twenty, and then in a long and uneasy wandering around the world. Insofar as I have always turned to you, daring and searching with each of your characters what "surpasses" man, I am again turning to you because I have a feeling that, more than anyone else, you can understand Sri Aurobindo's message and perhaps draw a new impetus from it. I am also thinking of a whole generation of young people who expect much from you: more than an ideal of pure heroism, which only opens the doors (as does all self-offering) on another realm of man we have yet to explore, and more than a fascination with death, which also is only a means and not an end, although its brutal nakedness can sometimes open a luminous breach in the bodily prison ‚Äì where we seem to have been immured alive ‚Äì and we emerge into a new dimension</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 105</p>
<p class="P"> of our being. For we tend too often to forget that it is "for living" that your heroes think so constantly of death; also I think that the young people I mentioned want the truth of Tchen and Katow, the truth of Hernandez, Perken and Moreno [characters in Malraux's novels] beyond their death.</p>
<p class="P">It may seem strange to speak of you in an Indian Ashram that one would consider far removed from the world and the agonizing problems and struggles of the "Human Condition," but as a matter of fact Sri Aurobindo's Ashram is concerned with this earthly life; it wants to transform it instead of fleeing it as all traditional Indian and Western religions do, forever proclaiming that "His kingdom is not of this world." Knowing that there exists a fundamental reality beyond man, religions have focussed on that other realm to find the key to man just as your heroes focus on their death to discover the fundamental reality that will be able to "stand" in the face of death. But religion has not justified this life, except as a transition toward a Beyond which is supposedly the supreme goal; and your heroes ‚Äì though so close to life's throbbing heart that at times it seems to explode and reveal its poignant secret ‚Äì finally plunge into death, as if to free themselves from an Absolute they cannot live in the flesh.</p>
<p class="P">The young Indian students with whom I discuss your books understand perhaps better than Westerners the reason for all those bloody and apparently useless sacrifices ‚Äì the torments conflicts and revolts of your heroes condemned to death, the great Hunger that drives them beyond themselves ‚Äì for they know that these are like the contractions of childbirth, and that the thick shell of egoism, routine, conformism, intellectual and sentimental habits must be broken for the inner Divine to transpierce the surface of this life ‚Äì for the Divine is indeed WITHIN man, and life harbors its own hidden justification. Echoing the Upanishad, Sri Aurobindo tells us that "The earth is His foothold." He also wrote, "God is not only in the still small voice, but in the fire and the whirlwind."</p>
<p class="P">I think I am correctly interpreting the feeling of my young Indian friends when I say that they see the heroes of your novels as "raw mystics," to use Claudel's description of Rimbaud. This may seem a surprising attribute, considering your heroes' atheism, but that is because we have too often confused mysticism or spirituality with religion, as Sri Aurobindo stresses. One need not believe in a personal, extracosmic God to be a mystic. (That is certainly why religion has from time to time taken upon itself to bum alive all the "non-regular" mystics.) Here we touch upon a huge confusion</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 106</p>
<p class="P"> rooted in religions. Through their monks, sannyasins and ascetics, religions have shown us a purely contemplative, austere and lifeless side of mysticism ‚Äì indeed those mystics, like the religions they practice, live in a negation of life; they go through this "vale of tears" with their eyes exclusively fixed on the Beyond. But true mysticism is not so limited as that, it seeks to transform life, to reveal the Absolute hidden in it; it seeks to establish "the kingdom of God in man," as Sri Aurobindo wrote, "and not the kingdom of a Pope, clergy or sacerdotal class." If the modem world lives in conflict and anguish, if it is torn between "being" and "doing," it is because religion has driven away God from this world, severed him from his creation and flung him back to some distant heaven or empty nirvana, thus denying any possibility of human perfection on this earth and digging an unbridgeable gulf between being and doing, between mystics sunk in their dreams and this world abandoned to the forces of evil, to Satan and all those who consent to "get their hands dirty."</p>
<p class="P">That contradiction is powerfully expressed in your books, it is striking to my Indian students. And they are surprised, for the urge to "do" something at all costs ‚Äì "to do anything at all, as long as we do something," as one often hears in Europe ‚Äì without this action being based on a "being" which it expresses and of which it is but the material translation, appears to them a strange attitude. Neither the despair, the silence or the revolt, nor the absurd pointlessness that sometimes surrounds the death of many of your heroes escape them. They feel that your heroes flee from themselves rather than express themselves. This torment between "being" and "doing" can be found in each one of them. They have apparently renounced to "be" something in order to "do" something, as one character stresses in <em>Hope</em>, but are they not desperately seeking to "be" through their actions, a "being" that they will capture only as time is abolished, in death? The same obsession seems to run through each of them: from Perken, who wants to "leave his scar on the map," to "outlive himself through twenty tribes," who fights against time as one fights against cancer, to Tchen, who shuts himself in the world of terrorism: "an eternal world where time does not exist," and to Katow, who whispers to himself, "O prisons, where time stops." In that respect, these characters clearly symbolize the impotence of a religion that has not been able to give the earth its meaning and plenitude.</p>
<p class="P">To the question raised by the Swedish magazine and to the one many characters in your books ask themselves, I believe that Sri</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 107</p>
<p class="P"> Aurobindo and his vast synthesis bring the key to a reconciliation and long-sought answer, a reconciliation between being and doing, which religion is incapable of supplying. "Through our Yoga," Sri Aurobindo wrote, "we propose nothing less than to break totally the past and present formations which make up the ordinary mental and material man and create a new centre of vision, a new universe of activities in ourselves, which will form a divine humanity or a superhuman nature." This is not an "idea" but an experience <em>to be lived</em>, which Sri Aurobindo has minutely described in his extensive body of works. It is what some thousand men and women from all over the world are trying to do at the Pondicherry Ashram.</p>
<p class="P">In your reply to the Swedish magazine, you emphasize, "The major obstacle to tolerance is not agnosticism but Manichaeism." That is also why religions will never be able to unite humanity, because they have remained Manichaean in their principle, because they are founded on morality, on a sense of good and evil, necessarily varying from one country to the next. Religions will not reconcile men with one another any more than they have reconciled men with themselves, or reconciled their aspiration to "be" with their need for action ‚Äì and for the same reasons, for in both cases they have dug an abyss between an ideal good, a "being" they have relegated to heaven, and an evil, a "becoming," which reigns supreme in a world where "all is vanity." I would like to quote here a passage from Sri Aurobindo's <em>Essays on the Gita</em> which throws a clear light on the problem: "To put away the responsibility for all that seems to us evil or terrible on the shoulders of a semi-omnipotent Devil, or to put it aside as part of Nature, making an unbridgeable opposition between world-nature and God-Nature, as if Nature were independent of God, or to throw the responsibility on man and his sins, as if he had a preponderant voice in the making of this world or could create anything against the will of God, are clumsily comfortable devices in which the religious thought of India has never taken refuge. We have to look courageously in the face of the reality and see that it is God and none else who has made this world in his being and that so he has made it. We have to see that Nature devouring her children, Time eating up the lives of creatures, Death universal and ineluctable and the violence of the Rudra forces in man and Nature are also the supreme Godhead in one of his cosmic figures. We have to see that God the bountiful and prodigal creator, God the helpful, strong and benignant preserver is also God the devourer and destroyer. The torment of the couch of pain and evil on which we are racked is his</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 108</p>
<p class="P"> touch as much as happiness and sweetness and pleasure. It is only when we see with the eye of the complete union and feel this truth in the depths of our being that we can entirely discover behind that mask too the calm and beautiful face of the all-blissful Godhead and in this touch that tests our imperfection the touch of the friend and builder of the spirit in man. The discords of the worlds are God's discords and it is only by accepting and proceeding through them that we can arrive at the greater concords of his supreme harmony."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="28" href="#">2</a> I believe that the characters of your books would not be seeking sacrifice and death so intensely if they did not feel the side of light and joy behind the mask of darkness in which they so passionately lose themselves.</p>
<p class="P">Sri Aurobindo has constantly stressed that, through progressive evolutionary cycles, humanity must go beyond the purely ethical and religious stage, just as it must go beyond the infrarational and rational stage, in order to reach a new "spiritual and suprarational age" ‚Äì otherwise we will simply remain doomed to the upheavals, conflicts and bloody sacrifices that shake our times, "for living according to a code of morality is always a tragedy," as one of the characters in <em>Hope</em> notes.</p>
<p class="P">The tragedies we are experiencing ‚Äì communism, Nazism ‚Äì are not rooted, as the Swedish magazine implies, in the weakening or disappearance of religion, it is religion itself which is the source of the disequilibrium insofar as it is fossilized in dogmas, as it clings to a power it possesses in a human cycle drawing to its close, and as it refuses to open itself to a "new deeper notion in man" which would at long last reconcile heaven and earth. As a result, men go elsewhere to seek what religion is unable to provide: in communism or any other "ism," so great and persistent is their thirst for the Absolute ‚Äì for <em>that?</em> abides under one name or another and that very thirst is the surest sign of a fullness to come.</p>
<p class="P">At this crucial juncture in human evolution, Sri Aurobindo brings a luminous message to which I hope to draw your attention through this letter and the book I am taking the liberty of sending you. I think the youth of Europe have a profound need to hear a great voice that would bring them face to face with their fundamental truths; none can, better than you, touch that youth and awaken the anguished Occident.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 109</p>
<p class="P">I deeply hope, Sir, that Sri Aurobindo's works will be a new source of inspiration for you.</p>

It feels (I don't know how to explain it), it feels the complete Presence of the Divine, I mean in all things, everywhere, all the time, as if it were at once enveloped and permeated by it ‚Äì and it asked for something even more concrete. Then, a kind of Consciousness answered me that the body wasn't given a more complete perception because it would still feel like... (what shall I say?) fusing into the Divine, and then the cells would... (<em>gesture of explosion</em>). So the body would lose its form.</p>

I mean all external processes ‚Äì food and so on ‚Äì seem then so cumbersome! Without a doubt the next creation will use something else, another way of staying alive, but we don't yet know what it is. I have a feeling there already exists a certain type of food ‚Äì an intermediary type of food ‚Äì which is no longer like the old kind but isn't yet...

Actually, we understand it now, Mother would have liked Sujata to become her personal assistant after Vasudha, but she knew the importance of Sujata's work with Satprem, so she never asked. Had this been otherwise, the subsequent course of events would have changed.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-32"><sup>7</sup> As an illustration we are tempted to publish here a letter Mother wrote to Sujata's father, Prithwi Singh, way back in February 1951. Barely two months after Sri Aurobindo's passing, certain inmates of the Ashram were already showing their true colors: ‚ÄúMy dear child,‚Äù Mother wrote, ‚ÄúI am not aware of having said anything that could give you the slightest pain ‚Äì so I advise you not to listen to what people say. Most of them take a very great pleasure in disturbing others, and when they have nothing nasty to repeat they invent.‚Äù</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-33"><sup>8</sup> Mother often called for Sujata for typing and filing her notes, messages, translations, etc., or else for conveying something to Satprem. Apart from typing work, Sujata also looked after Mother's toiletry and perfumery.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-34"><sup>9</sup> Mother was never allowed to live her experience. A few days after she left her body, in a speech before the assembled disciples, Pranab, Mother's ‚Äúbodyguard,‚Äù ingenuously declared: ‚ÄúAccording to the advice of Dr. Sanyal, we were to give Her about 20 to 25 ozs. of food every day. It consisted of a little vegetable soup, milk with some protein compound, paste made of almonds, mushrooms, artichokes or things like that and some fruit juice at the end.... All those who were in the courtyard below [Mother's room] must have heard how we had to fight with Her to make Her eat a little.‚Äù [Original English] This fight over food (to mention only one) created a sharp conflict in Mother's body; she was torn between their suggestions ‚Äì ‚ÄúIf you don't eat, you're going to die‚Äù ‚Äì and the thrust of the Experience.</p>

But we keep running up against the same problem, which I have summarized in this letter:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>"Auroville is burdened by a small group of people who are contaminating its life and spirit and jeopardizing its progress. They thwart any effort to implement safety and hygiene measures, working decisions, and they behave in contradiction to Auroville's ideal.

<p class="P">In a general and absolute way, difficulties are ALWAYS graces. And due to... (how can I put it?) human weakness they fail to be helpful. Difficulties are ALWAYS graces. I have been on earth for quite a while this time and always ‚Äì always, always, always, without a single exception ‚Äì I have seen in the end that difficulties are nothing but graces. I can neither feel nor see things otherwise because it has been my experience all my life. I might be upset at first and say, "How come, I am full of goodwill, yet difficulties keep piling up...." But afterwards, I could have simply given myself a slap: "Silly you! It's just to bring more perfection to your character and the work!" There.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Some persons have been driven out of the Ashram into Auroville. Those, I admit, are difficult elements who make things difficult. I wish they would be naturally driven out of Auroville to... somewhere else. This wouldn't be very nice for the rest of the world ‚Äì but never mind! Although in a free environment, they may be tolerable. Practically, one would have to speak to each one individually.</p>
<p class="P">Now go on, tell me what you wanted to say.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(The architect:) Well, Mother, I simply wanted to know if we are supposed to accept the presence of these seemingly undesirable people as a necessity for Auroville's growth, and if so, we'll just have to act accordingly and face the difficulties they represent; or should we take definite measures to solve the problems of safety, the problems of hygiene....</em></p>
<p class="P">What problems of hygiene? What problems of safety?</p>
<p class="P"><em>For example, Mother, it's absolutely useless to give them fire extinguishers, hoses and water if they don't make any effort to learn how to use the fire extinguisher and keep the water hose in proper condition.</em></p>

<p class="P">Yes, that's plain.</p>
<p class="P"><em>The same for hygiene.</em></p>
<p class="P">Is there no one who could be given the responsibility for those things?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, we'll have to manage with what we have.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes. Something could be organized with the people we can trust, and if the others are dissatisfied, they can leave. Do you understand what I mean? Instead of taking an active position of "Go away" (which for many reasons is very difficult), if we put them under an authority they don't accept, they will be forced to leave. They will protest at first, but we must remain firm: "This is how it is."</p>
<p class="P">We must find the people capable of doing this, with the required strength of character, and once we find them, they can be given the authority, and if the others don't like it, they'll have to leave! And that's that. But we can't dismiss people who are already there as long as we don't have the person or persons capable of actively assuming that position.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, it's clear. But there's also the problem of admissions to Auroville.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh ‚Äì well?</p>
<p class="P"><em>For instance, certain elements seem absolutely undesirable to us from the start. And yet these people are sometimes accepted Is there a reason for this?</em></p>
<p class="P">On trial. Only on a trial basis, never otherwise.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But, Mother, once they're here on trial, nobody can ever send them away!</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah, no! If they are not satisfactory, they can be sent away. I was only speaking of those (this is in fact what I was saying to S.S.) whom I was forced to remove from the Ashram because they were totally undesirable in the Ashram,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="38" href="#">1</a> and they went to Auroville;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 133</p>
<p class="P"> these people should either go, or else feel... as I said, feel that they have no place here. But the newcomers, those who are accepted on a trial basis and who turn out to be undesirable, can be sent away. I meant the old-timers, those who have been here for years and years. But the newcomers, all those who have been taken on trial and are not satisfactory, they can leave ‚Äì they MUST leave. I give you full authority to send them away.</p>
<p class="P">You see, some people come to me ‚Äì I don't know their names, I don't know what they do, I know nothing about them; the new requests for admission should come to me through one of you two (because you know the practical situation and the people). Unfortunately, many people write to me, and I don't know, you see, I never remember names; I only remember when I know who they are, what they do and so on. But if you know these people's worth and can tell me, "This one is like this or that," I trust what you say; and if you tell me, "That person is undesirable," well, he must go. But I have to be informed beforehand, because people usually go through one person, then another to get their request to me, and I don't keep track, I don't know. Do you see the picture? I give a general answer, and they take it as... because I think it's somebody else. I don't remember, I forget names ‚Äì the next minute I have forgotten. My head is full of... something far vaster than all that, you know. There should be one person ‚Äì one or two (two is very good) ‚Äì to present the admissions to me, the new admissions to Auroville, and I fully agree to send back those you find undesirable.</p>
<p class="P">Do you understand?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. But at present all the requests are presented by S.S. No one else presents requests from newcomers. So things should be simple?</em></p>
<p class="P">Are you sure about that?</p>

<p class="P"><em>(S.S.:) They have been there for a week now, on trial.</em></p>
<p class="P">You must give them at least one month. At least one month. But if they show the slightest insincerity, you understand, if they say, "I don't do this, I do that, I won't do this, etc...", just tell them, "You can leave." You don't even need to ask me, you can just send them away. Simply inform me: such and such person has been found unsatisfactory. I give you the authority to do it. I won't protest. But I must be informed because plenty of people come to me and... they're very cunning, you see: they find another person to channel their request.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(The architect:) The question in our minds, Mother, was to know whether you saw these people as being useful in providing Auroville with a certain type of difficulty.</em></p>
<p class="P">No! Certainly not! No, no, I don't favor deliberately adding difficulties! I know they come for.... But they shouldn't be invited ‚Äì on the contrary. They shouldn't. Things should be made as easy as possible. Only, we shouldn't be ruffled by difficulty, that's the point. I am not at all saying that difficulties should be accepted ‚Äì don't invite them at all, at all, at all; life is difficult enough as it is! But when a difficulty comes, you must take heart and face it courageously.</p>
<p class="P">We must strive for Order, Harmony, Beauty and... collective aspiration ‚Äì all the things which for the moment are not there. We must... you see, being the organizers, our task is to set the example of what we want others to do. We must rise above personal reactions, be exclusively attuned to the divine Will and be the docile instruments of the divine Will ‚Äì we must be impersonal, without any personal reaction.</p>
<p class="P">We must "be" in all sincerity. What the Divine wants ‚Äì let it be. That's all. If we can be that, then we are as we ought to be, and THAT is what we must become. For the rest... for all the rest, we do the best we can.</p>
<p class="P">I know it's not easy, but we are not here to do easy things; the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 135</p>
<p class="P"> whole world is there for those who like an easy life. I would like people to feel that coming to Auroville does not mean coming to an easy life ‚Äì it means coming to a gigantic effort for progress. And those who don't want to keep up with it should leave. That's how things stand. I wish It were so strong ‚Äì the need for progress, for the divinization of the being, so intense ‚Äì that those who are unable (unable or unwilling) to adjust to it would leave by themselves: "Oh, this is not what I expected." As it is now, all those who want an easy life and to do what they please as they please, say, "Let's go to Auroville!" It should be just the opposite. People should know that coming to Auroville means an almost superhuman effort for progress.</p>
<p class="P">It is the sincerity of our attitude and effort which makes a difference. People should feel that insincerity and falsehood have no place here ‚Äì they just don't work, you can't fool people who have devoted their entire life to go beyond humanity.</p>
<p class="P">There is only one way to be convincing ‚Äì it is to BE that.</p>
<p class="P">Then we'll stand strong, we'll have all the divine force on our side.</p>
<p class="P">We are here to prepare a superhumanity, not to fall back into desires and easy life ‚Äì no.</p>
<p class="P">People must feel it; it should be so strong that the sheer force of our sincerity would drive them out ‚Äì that's what they have to feel. At that point, we will be what we should be. The power of the realization ‚Äì of the sincerity of the realization ‚Äì is such that it's UNBEARLABLE to those who are insincere.</p>

<p class="P">That's what Sri Aurobindo always said. If men only knew this: if in all sincerity ‚Äì in all sincerity ‚Äì they give themselves to the Divine and side with the Divine, they become all they should be.</p>
<p class="P">It may take time, there may be turmoil and difficulty ‚Äì you must be... inflexible: "I am for the Divine and the divine manifestation,</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>The Characters in the Play</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>The following conversation makes it necessary to explain the physical conditions Mother was living in. Alas, at the time I was still half-blind to these conditions, for Mother had wrapped me in such a cocoon of light that I could not really see what was happening ‚Äì she knew my impetuous nature, she knew I would never have tolerated the situation in her room nor people's petty intrigues had I known what was really happening there. But gradually I did become aware of certain things.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 137</p>
<p class="P"><em>Unknowingly, I was a witness to a tragedy.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>But "tragedy" is afterwards, when it's too late. At the time, there are only people coming and going, with their everyday gestures, their empty words and simmering little desires, no worse or better than anybody else, and who don't really know what they are doing or where they are going. And yet the tragedy is already sealed in this little gesture, that careless action, those few fleeting words. Was the Trojan War not taking place "every day"? Did Alexander not die on "one fine day"? Destiny seizes upon a few beings and abruptly crystallizes a great moment in History, but the players are neither "cruel" nor "gentle" ‚Äì they are much like everyday people, but with only a tiny distinction in their hearts. Each player plays his part, in black or white, for an unfathomable goal where everything is reconciled...</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>But in the meantime....</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Mother's immediate entourage was then composed of: Pranab, her "bodyguard," a former boxer, a violent and arrogant man whose flagrant flaws were the reverse side of a Love he never accepted, because it would have meant surrendering himself. "A for-mi-dable pride," Mother once told me.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="40" href="#">1</a> He trusted nothing except his biceps and was frustrated in his dreams of "superman" without any tangible physiological realization. In his own way, he was perfectly devoted, as a sportsman who knows he has lost the game he had hoped to win but sportingly plays on till the end. He treated Mother like a brute and talked to her like a brute, but he served her brutishly, sparing no pains, although with a growing impatience. He served Mother for more than twenty-five years. Pranab had an instinctive aversion toward me, as he had toward Pavitra (whom he badly mistreated), and in general toward anything that exceeded his primitive intellect ‚Äì Pranab could only love what he was able to dominate. He was also openly xenophobic: the "sahibs," as he would say, forgetting, or maybe not, that Mother, too, was a "foreigner." There were never any exchanges between Pranab and myself, we lived in completely different worlds and the work of one did not infringe upon that of the other. He only showed his annoyance and contempt for me when, entering Mother's room ponderously, he would find her in contemplation, holding my hands ‚Äì perhaps he was eager for a Love that eluded him. I never spoke a word to him. He never said anything to me.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>The second person in Mother's entourage was her physician, Dr. Sanyal. A completely devoted, clear and uncalculating man but with a total lack of faith, except in his medicine and medical methods. He lived for some twenty years with Mother with no understanding of</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="P"><em> what she was doing, sowing her bodyconsciousness with his doubts and medical impossibilities. Mother has referred to him on several occasions in this Agenda.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>The third person was Mother's helper, Champaklal, who had also been Sri Aurobindo's attendant. A pure-hearted man, simple and utterly devoted There is nothing to say about him, except my respect. He had come from his Gujarati village straight to the Ashram, some fifty years earlier, at the age of eighteen. There was nothing between his village and Sri Aurobindo. He understood nothing of what was happening ‚Äì he simply served and did as he was bidden.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>The fourth and last person was Mother's new attendant. She is going to appear in the following conversation. I was particularly blind about her because she was young and affectionate ‚Äì but she was completely under Pranab's thumb and ruled by her passions. I had, of course, noticed that she was listening in on my conversations with Mother, thus subtly clouding the atmosphere, invisibly breaking in upon Mother's free expression; for, needless to say, Mother sensed all that went on in the atmosphere. How many times did she stop in the middle of a sentence, invisibly interrupted: "I can't speak" ‚Äì that was not just because she was short of breath. Hence, the atmosphere of our conversations was no longer what it had been for the last fifteen years, until 1970. But in addition, we were responsible for a new and sad turn of events. We knew that Mother frequently spoke about Auroville, or with one disciple or another, and we regretted the loss of those words ‚Äì to us each of her words seemed to have so much importance for the world, even if we were not yet fully able to understand all that she was saying. So with her approval, we managed to obtain a small, easy-to-operate cassette recorder. It had been agreed with Mother that her attendant would record all the important conversations in Mother's room, then pass them on to me to be added to the Agenda. At first, I noticed that the attendant was keeping the tapes, but an innate shyness kept me from saying anything lest I appear to "monopolize" things or seem pushing, and also I didn't know exactly whose instructions she was obeying. Then, gradually, the attendant stopped giving me the recordings altogether, even those of Mother with Sujata. At that point, the situation in Mother's room was so fragile that I didn't want to say anything, for fear of sparking an outburst that would have ultimately bounced on Mother. I was already feeling also the invisible barrier against Sujata, whose name was systematically crossed off the list of visitors under one pretext or another, along with those of the few young women who were the Ashram's positive ‚Äì and silent ‚Äì elements.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="P"><em> And how could we possibly argue when Sujata was told, "Mother cannot see you... Mother is sick..."? Once, Sujata mentioned it to Mother, but when the same incident occurred three, four, ten times, there was nothing to be said. Without knowing why, I too was feeling my own meetings with Mother threatened and precarious. In fact, we were alone, facing an obscure league of opposition. Why the opposition? There is no answer ‚Äì except human pettiness, which does not understand and hates everything that exceeds it. Even Mother's own son was jealous of my place near her, not to mention the others, the "liars" pure and simple, as Mother used to call them, who were, and still are, directing the Ashram. Finally, much later, I discovered that the notorious cassette recorder, whose recordings I was no longer even receiving, was clandestinely used to record my own conversations with Mother ‚Äì on whose behalf?</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>That was the end. The atmosphere had become so rotten that, obviously, it could not last much longer ‚Äì Mother was suffocating there. I later discovered in my own body and from direct experience that all bad thoughts are agonizing to the body, they create a sort of oppression as if you were short of air. Yet, even when they closed Mother's door on me, a year and a month later almost to the day, on May 19, 1973, I COULD NOT believe it was the end. I was convinced that this was the last stage, that Mother was finally going to shake off the old slavery to food: the last tie to the old physiology. But, as we now know, her "bodyguard" would not let her. In his speech on December 4, 1973, he declared, "In the beginning [from May 20], She refused to take any food or drink, but somehow we persuaded Her to take them."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="41" href="#">2</a> She did fight as much as she could, and then.... At times, I seemed to hear her faltering little voice up there: "Where is Satprem? Where is Satprem?..." and then silence. Had I attempted to force the barrier, this Agenda would never have seen the light of day. In a way, the following conversation is therefore prophetic.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Such was Mother's immediate entourage: a devoted but uncomprehending helper, a doctor with no faith, a violent and despotic bodyguard, and a blind and blinded little being controlled by her passions and by Pranab.</em></p>

Useless ‚Äì it would only have unleashed the pack before we had time to get this Agenda to safety. Here are the facts, as reported in English by Pranab himself in a public speech, on December 4, 1973:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"I arrived at about five past seven [in Mother's room, the evening of November 17] and saw that Dr. Sanyal was already there examining Her. Dyumanbhai [the disciple who brought Mother her meals] also had come. I went and felt the Mother's pulse. It was still there, beating at long intervals. There was still some respiration. But slowly everything stopped. The doctor gave an external heart massage to Her. It had no effect. Then he declared that the Mother had left Her body. This was at 7:25 p.m. Then, being present and feeling my responsibility, I thought what I should do. At that time there were present Andr√© [Mother's son], Champaklalji [the helper], Dr. Sanyal, Dyumanbhai, Kumud [the attendant] and myself. I talked with Andr√© and told him that I wanted to wait for some time and then take the Mother's body down, place it in the Meditation Hall for people to see. We would keep the body in such a way that it was not disturbed, then we would decide what to do. Andr√© agreed to my proposal. He wanted to remain with us but as he was not well I suggested that he should go home and take rest and come the next day. He left. We remained there and discussed what to do.</p>
<p class="P">"Now we thought that if people immediately came to know about the Mother's passing there would be a big rush, and the crowd would all clamor to see Her. There would be noise and shouts and a tremendous confusion. So we thought of keeping the event secret for some time. Also Dr. Sanyal said that we must not disturb the body in any way for several hours. So the Mother was left as She</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 145</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"> was and after 11 o'clock, when the gate of the Ashram was closed, we cleaned Her body with eau de cologne, put a nice dress on Her, arranged everything and then Dyumanbhai and I went down and called Nolinida. Nolinida came up, saw everything, and asked what we were going to do. I mentioned my plans to him. He said the Mother had once told him that if it looked to us that She had left her body we should not be in a hurry, but see that Her body was properly kept, and then wait. I said, 'We are just about to do the same. We have cleaned Her, otherwise ants and insects would have come. We have put on Her a new dress and we shall carry Her quietly, carefully downstairs and lay Her in the Meditation Hall. After some time we shall call people.' He agreed to our proposal.... At about 2 o'clock [in the morning] we brought the Mother's body down, placed Her on the bed, arranged everything. Then I went out, called Mona, told him to come and see me with four other boys, five of my lieutenants, so to say. When they came I explained to them what to do: to call the photographers first, then to call the [Ashram] trustees, then all those who were very close to Her.... From 3 o'clock the people who had been called started coming. While we were upstairs, we prepared some kind of statement that could go to the Press and to All India Radio so that no wrong information might go out.... Our draft of the statement we got corrected by Nirodda and gave it to Udar to circulate. At 4:15 in the morning we opened the gate of the Ashram for people to come in and have a last Darshan...."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>Thus, SIX HOURS AND THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES after Mother's so-called death, they brought her downstairs, they removed her body from the peace and protection of her atmosphere... and then they threw her to thousands of avidly curious visitors amidst glaring neon lights and droning fans, just EIGHT HOURS AND FIFTY MINUTES after.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>What universal complicity bound all these people together, who ALL fully knew that Mother's body was to be left in peace in her room, who ALL were fully aware of Mother's "instructions"?</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Had they wanted to get rid of her, they could not have rushed any faster.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Pranab himself brazenly declared in his speech:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"One thing She repeated to me often quite some time back, and to some other persons also. She said that all the work She was doing on Her body could be spoilt in two ways ‚Äì one, this force She was pulling down on Her could be so strong, so great, that</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 146</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"> the body would not be able to tolerate it and the body might fail.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="42" href="#">5</a> That was a possibility. The second thing was that if ever She went into a deep trance and it looked to us that She had left Her body, then if by mistake we put Her in the Samadhi [tomb], that would absolutely spoil Her work. And She gave instructions that we should give the body the necessary protection, we should watch, and only when we would be absolutely sure that She had left Her body we should put Her in the Samadhi. I think we have done as She had wanted."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>True, they did all that was necessary "to be absolutely sure." Removing her from her room was in effect condemning her to a sure death.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>No one ever informed us of anything. We were not among those "close" to Mother. It is Sujata's brother, Abhay Singh ‚Äì himself alerted by the public rumor, who sent word to us. We arrived at the Ashram around six in the morning, stunned, to find thousands of people filling past ‚Äì it had been six months since we had last seen Mother. Less than five minutes later, Nolini called me to translate the press release into French as well as his own "message" ‚Äì they all had a "message" ready. He handed me a piece of paper. I could not believe my eyes. I read like an automaton:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"The Mother's body belonged to the old creation. It was not meant to be the New Body.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="43" href="#">6</a> It was meant to be the pedestal of the New Body. It served its purpose well. The New Body will come.... The revival of the body would have meant revival of the old troubles in the body. The body troubles were eliminated so far as could be done being in the body ‚Äì farther was not possible. For a new mutation, new procedure was needed. 'Death' was the first stage in that process."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>I read once again, in speechless outrage: "The Mother's body belonged to the old creation. It was not meant to be the New Body..."

<p class="P">There are incredible things in the subconscient ‚Äì incredible. I spend entire nights watching them. And it goes down and down and down... IMPERATIVELY.</p>
<p class="P">So the human subconscient cries out, "Oh, not yet, please, not yet ‚Äì not so fast!" And that's what you are up against. A general subconscient.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Yes, tremendously. One wonders how it will end, and at times one gets really worried.</em></p>
<p class="P">No, you shouldn't. You simply... keep clinging to the Divine. For, of course, the resistance has such wonderful reasoning! "You see," it says, "You see where all this is leading you, you see...." Oh, it's... it's more than a resistance; it is PERVERSE.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>

<p class="P">After some time it becomes absolutely wonderful, but one goes through some difficult moments.</p>

<p class="P">You sit on the mind (<em>Mother gives a little slap</em>): shut up.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 153</p>
<p class="P">The subconscient contains the memory of all the <em>previous</em> "pralayas,"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46" href="#">2</a> and this memory is what always gives us the impression that everything is going to dissolve, to collapse.</p>
<p class="P">But if you look at things in the true light, there can only be a more beautiful manifestation! Th√©on had told me this was the seventh and last one. Sri Aurobindo (I had told him what Th√©on said), Sri Aurobindo concurred, for he said, "This one will see the transformation towards the Supermind." But to reach the Supermind, the mind must SHUT up! And I always get the impression (<em>laughing</em>) of a child sitting on the mind's head (<em>gesture like a child kicking its feet</em>), playing on the mind's head! If I could still draw, it would make something really funny. The mind ‚Äì that huge terrestrial mind (<em>Mother puffs out her cheeks</em>) ‚Äì which thinks itself so important and indispensable, and then a child sitting on its head and playing! It's so funny.</p>
<p class="P">Ah, mon petit, we don't have faith! The moment one has faith....</p>
<p class="P">We say, "We want a divine life" ‚Äì but we're afraid of it! The second the fear disappears and we are sincere... really, everything changes.</p>
<p class="P">We say, "We want nothing more of this life," but... (<em>laughing</em>) something in us clings to it!</p>

<p class="P">It's so ridiculous.</p>
<p class="P">We cling to our old ideas, our old... to this old world bound for extinction ‚Äì we're afraid!</p>
<p class="P">While the divine child sitting on the mind's head plays!... I wish I could draw that picture, it's so wonderful.</p>
<p class="P">We are so silly we even say (<em>Mother puts on an air of offended dignity</em>): the Divine is wrong, "You shouldn't handle things that way!" It's comical, mon petit.</p>

<p class="P"><em>What about you? (Laughter)</em></p>
<p class="P">Me... (<em>laughing</em>) it's all right. It's one difficult thing after another. Yesterday was what I call the "change of government" for the heart, so... it's a difficult moment. But now it's all right.</p>
<p class="P">The other day, when I saw that little child playing (I still see it), on top of a HUGE mental head, giving it blows ‚Äì it's the supramental. But what are we going to call that being?... We mustn't call it "superman," it isn't the superman: it's the supramental. Because, you see, the transition from animal to man is clear to us; the transition from man to supramental being is accomplished (or isn't) through the superman ‚Äì there may be a few supermen (there are) who will actually make that transition, but that's not actually</p>

<p class="P"> how it works. First, that supramental being has to be born.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="47" href="#">1</a> Now it's becoming plainer and plainer. The other day, I saw that little being (symbolically a child) sitting on a big mental head: it was the supramental being sitting, to symbolize its "independence," I could say, over the mind.</p>
<p class="P">Things are becoming clearer. But we are just in the transitional period, the most difficult time.</p>
<p class="P">Will some reach a similar state ‚Äì at least similar or at any rate precursor to the supramental?... Such seems to be the present attempt, what is taking place now. And so you are no longer on this side, not yet on the other ‚Äì you are... (<em>suspended gesture</em>). Rather a precarious condition.</p>
<p class="P">Obviously, for all those who are born now and are here now have asked to participate in this, they have prepared for it in previous lives. From the standpoint of global knowledge, it would be interesting to know what's happening and how it's happening. But from the individual standpoint, it's not exactly pleasant(!), the period is difficult: you are no longer on this side, not yet on the other ‚Äì just in between. There we stand.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Indeed, for passing into the supramental being it isn't necessary to pass though the overmind ...</em></p>

<p class="P">Oh, no! No.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 157</p>
<p class="P">Oh, no, the realm of the gods... stands apart. I don't think it has much to do with the earth's problems. Only sometimes those gods enjoy meddling in earthly affairs. But they don't have much in common with the great Movement of transformation.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, quite so.</em></p>
<p class="P">They are immortal, aren't they, they are free (to a large extent, they are free and immortal). They have taken part in the earth's development only out of curiosity, as a sort of pastime!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">They may have helped humanity to understand that there is something beyond earth-life.</p>
<p class="P">That was their usefulness.</p>
<p class="P">At one time (<em>laughing</em>), I was very close to all these beings, they used to manifest in me, they would ‚Äì well, they enjoyed it! And I enjoyed it, too! I was interested; but I never considered it as something essential.</p>
<p class="P"><em>So, in other words, the new being you saw is the supramental baby!</em></p>
<p class="P">(<em>Laughing</em>) Yes! But I think this "baby" is a baby only symbolically.... I don't know if he will come as a child and then grow up ‚Äì I have no idea. There are still some things that I don't know ‚Äì plenty!</p>
<p class="P">But what happened the day before yesterday is that, in the middle of the night, the heart passed from the old government of Nature to the divine government, so at one point there was... it was difficult. But accompanied by a... strange sensation, a sort of feeling that... the closest thing is the psychic consciousness. It has been governing the being for a long, long time ‚Äì that's why the mind and the vital could be removed, because the psychic being had taken up the reins long, long ago.</p>
<p class="P">As a matter of fact, I wanted to tell you (I don't know if I did<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="48" href="#">2</a>): the first time I went to Tlemcen (I don't remember when exactly),</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 158</p>

I remember we were walking in his huge estate, we were walking up towards the house, and I told him (<em>Mother raises her index finger</em>), "My psychic being governs me ‚Äì I am afraid of nothing."

<p class="P">It's true. It is true, but I wasn't sure you were fully conscious of it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, I was! I felt... but I'm always afraid of deluding myself, you know.</em></p>
<p class="P">No ‚Äì no, that's the mind in you, mon petit, give it a tap on the head!</p>

<p class="P">Yes, that's right. Only the Grace can do that.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, yes!</em></p>
<p class="P">This is exactly the meaning of my vision: the transition won't take place according to mind's ways, it's a baby sitting on the mind and playing. I can still see it.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, I experienced strongly how it's really the Grace that accomplishes everything.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>All we can do is... call the grace, and that's all.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, call, be receptive ‚Äì eager for an answer.</p>
<p class="P">I felt that very strongly, yesterday. I was going through a difficult moment ‚Äì pain in the body, with irregular heartbeat (alternately starting and stopping), painful ‚Äì when, just at that instant, the being simply... (<em>Mother opens her hands</em>): "What You will, Lord, what You will." Within a few hours everything was back in order. How was it done? I don't know. Only this (<em>Mother opens her hands</em>).</p>
<p class="P">And for everything, everything, all problems, do like this (<em>Mother opens her hands</em>): what You will, Lord, what You will....</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 160</p>
<p class="P">I know ‚Äì I say "will," but it's neither a vision nor the will of the Divine, it's... His way of being. A particular way of being ‚Äì successive ways of being. We always think of a "conscious will," but it isn't like that: it's His way of being. The way of being of His consciousness. He has projected His consciousness into a creation: it's His way of being.

<p class="P">The conscious will seems to want to assume a larger role. It makes life... much more efficient, obviously, but also more difficult.</p>
<p class="P"><em>More difficult in what way?</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, usually we passively leave it up to Nature to set things right when something goes wrong ‚Äì that's totally disappearing. Now it is a process of consciousness, and no longer.... You see, the mind (<em>laughing:</em> it's going on ‚Äì the supramental is still sitting on it!), the mind has been worked upon for years, so that it doesn't meddle when it's none of its business and lets Nature take care of all the damage; but now Nature is being told, "Keep quiet, a higher Consciousness will settle things." But that means the consciousness must be CONSTANTLY alert.</p>
<p class="P">Constantly alert.</p>

<p class="P"> a "basic" attitude it's very good, I could say. But when suddenly, something in the body goes wrong, and you don't know why (oh, most of the time it's due to an outside cause, like a disorder coming from outside), so then you don't know what to do ‚Äì there is no longer a mind to decide what to do; while the consciousness remains like this (<em>hands open upwards</em>). But then you don't know what to do, so you do nothing.</p>
<p class="P">There is certainly something to be learned.</p>

To me, you see, if the body had truly understood, it should become younger ‚Äì not "younger" but conscious. Instead of founding its base in the subconscient as everybody else, it should found it in the consciousness ‚Äì it is beginning to do it. It wants to; it wants, it strives. But there are still some... sort of habits. All in all, it's the subconscient that should be transformed.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Well, I guess I'm still hacking away at branches!</em></p>

<p class="Q">(<em>after a silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">From what Nirod is now reading me from his correspondence with Sri Aurobindo, it seems to have been the same with Sri Aurobindo. From what he writes (you'll see when you read it), everything is always done by me. He says, "Mother says, Mother does, Mother..." I mean, for anything involving the Ashram organization ‚Äì contact with people and so on ‚Äì it seems to be done quite naturally and all the time through me.</p>

<p class="P"> is annoying, nothing is pleasant. Since childhood, I recall a consciousness striving for... (that's what Sri Aurobindo meant) for indifference. Interesting! It makes me understand why he said that it was I who could attempt the transition between human consciousness and supramental consciousness. He said that. He said it to me and he says it here (it's written among Nirod's things). Now I understand why....</p>
<p class="P">Ah, I understand!</p>

<p class="P">(<em>Mother laughs cheerfully</em>) That, mon petit, may be my.... My body is exactly in that condition! (<em>Laughing</em>) Maybe that's why!</p>
<p class="P">What's more, it feels awful and ridiculous. Ridiculous and awful. It's the first effect of the consciousness of what has to be, it exerts a pressure. Even higher humanity is an awful and ridiculous thing for the overmind (<em>Mother corrects herself</em>), for the supramental ("supramental" is a word I don't like too much; I understand why Sri Aurobindo used it, he didn't want "superman" ‚Äì it's not superman at all). There is a far greater difference between a supramental being and a human being than between a human being and a chimpanzee.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, yes!</em></p>
<p class="P">But the difference is not so much external: it's a difference of consciousness. I can sense it, I sense it so vividly, and so close! When I am very still, it comes, from over there, and even the highest and most intellectual human consciousness is ridiculous in comparison.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">Awful.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 169</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. I don't know if I am in contact with "that," but when I remain still I sense something so full, so strong....</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>I am at ease.</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>You feel THAT. But then when you leave it to go back into Matter, it's terrible....</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Because "that" doesn't permeate here....</em></p>
<p class="P">It does permeate, but.... To be exact, we can say that it permeates with difficulty, but it does permeate. That's what causes the impression that life is awful. Personally, I feel that life is downright ridiculous ‚Äì grotesque. Grotesque.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">One must be thoroughly convinced of it before one can expect to receive that Consciousness. You know what I would say? It's a good sign ‚Äì it's not pleasant, but it's a good sign.</p>
<p class="P">But, of course, at best ‚Äì at the very best ‚Äì we are transitional beings. And well, transitional beings.... But the consciousness of the inner being ultimately gets stronger, you follow? Stronger even than the consciousness of the material being. So the material being can be dissolved, but the inner consciousness remains stronger. It is of that consciousness that we can say, "This is me."</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">There you are. THAT is the important thing.</p>
<p class="P">The important thing.</p>
<p class="P">As for me, the purpose of this body is now simply: the Command and the Will of the Lord, so I can do as much groundwork as possible. But it isn't the Goal at all. You see, we don't know, we don't have the slightest knowledge of what the supramental life is. Therefore we don't know if this (<em>Mother pinches the skin of her</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 170</p>
<p class="P"><em> hand</em>) can change enough to adapt or not ‚Äì and to tell the truth, I am not worried about it, it's not a problem that preoccupies me too much; the problem I am preoccupied with is building that supramental consciousness So IT becomes the being. It's that consciousness which must become the being. That's what's important. As for the rest, we'll see (it's the same as worrying over a change of clothing). But it must truly be IT, you see. And in order to do that, all the consciousness contained in these cells must aggregate, form and organize itself into an independent conscious entity ‚Äì the consciousness in the cells must aggregate and form into a conscious entity capable of being conscious of Matter as well as conscious of the Supramental. That's the thing. That's what is being done. How far will we be able to go? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P">You understand?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, I understand very well.</em></p>
<p class="P">How far we'll go, I don't know. I feel that if I last up to my hundredth birthday, that is, another six years, much will be accomplished ‚Äì much. Something significant and decisive will be accomplished. I am not saying that the body will be able to get transformed... I have no such signs, but the consciousness ‚Äì the physical, material consciousness becoming... "supramentalized." That's it, that's the work now in progress. And that's what's important. You too, you must be able, you must be destined to do that also, hence your disgust. But instead of dwelling on the disgust, you should dwell on the identification with the consciousness you are in when you are sitting still. You follow? That's the important part.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Mother, you speak of mistake, of error ‚Äì I don't know, maybe it's a fallacy, but I have a stronger and stronger notion that mistakes, errors, all that is unreal. It doesn't work that way. They're only a means, as it were. Yes, a means of widening the scope of our aspiration.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 177</p>
<p class="P">Yes, that's perfectly correct.</p>
<p class="P"><em>They cause pain ‚Äì mistakes, errors are basically pain, which is the means of awakening some aspiration in the deeper recesses of our being.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, quite true. The overall perception is that everything is... everything is meant to lead to the conscious ascent of the world. It is consciousness evolving towards divinity. And perfectly true at that: what we perceive as mistakes stems entirely from an ordinary human conception ‚Äì wholly and entirely.</p>
<p class="P"><em>The only mistake ‚Äì if it exists at all ‚Äì is in not wanting something else. But when you start wanting something else....</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, that's not a mistake, it's plain stupid!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, exactly, stupid. But it seems to me, the moment you want something else, each error or mistake ‚Äì everything ‚Äì serves a purpose.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, yes. Perfectly so. Really, it's very simple: the whole creation must want nothing but the Divine, want nothing but to manifest the Divine; all its actions (including its so-called mistakes) are a means to make it inevitable for the whole creation to manifest the Divine ‚Äì but not a "Divine" as man usually conceives of, with all kinds of limitations and restrictions: a TOTALITY of tremendous power and light.</p>
<p class="P">Truly the Power is IN the world, a new and stupendous Power which has come into the world to manifest the divine Almightiness and make it "manifestable," so to say.</p>
<p class="P">Through careful observation and attention, I have come to this conclusion: I have seen that what we call the "Supramental," for lack of a better word, is actually making the creation more susceptible to the higher Power, which we call "divine" because we... (it is divine compared to what we are, but...). It's something (<em>gesture of descent and pressure</em>) that will make Matter more receptive and more ... responsive to the Force. How can I explain it?... At present, whatever is invisible or imperceptible is unreal to us (I mean to human beings in general); we say that some things are "concrete" and others are not. But this Power, this Might, which is NOT MATERIAL, is becoming more concretely effective on earth than earthly material things. That's it.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 178</p>
<p class="P">And that is how the supramental beings will protect and defend themselves. In its appearance it won't be material but its power OVER MATTER will be greater than material things. Day by day, hour by hour this is getting truer and truer. The feeling that when this Force is guided by what we call the "Divine," it CAN DO, it really can do things, it has the power to move Matter, you understand; it can cause a MATERIAL accident, or avoid a wholly wholly material accident, it can cancel the consequences of an absolutely material event ‚Äì it is stronger than Matter. This is the totally new and incomprehensible fact. But it... (<em>fluttering gesture in the atmosphere</em>), it creates a sort of panic in the ordinary human consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">That's it. It seems that... things are no longer what they were. There's really something new ‚Äì things are NO LONGER what they were.</p>
<p class="P">All our common sense, our human logic, our practical sense ‚Äì collapsed, finished! No longer effective. No longer realistic. They are no longer relevant.</p>
<p class="P">A new world, really.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">And in the body, whatever has trouble adjusting to this new Power creates difficulties, disorders and illnesses. Yet in a flash you sense that if you were totally receptive, you would become formidable. That's the sensation. That's more and more my sensation: that if the entire consciousness, the entire most material consciousness ‚Äì the most material ‚Äì was receptive to this new Power... one would become for-mi-dable.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother closes her eyes</em>)</p>
<p class="P">But there is one essential condition: the ego's reign must come to an end. The ego is now the obstacle. The ego must be replaced by the divine consciousness ‚Äì what personally I call divine consciousness. Sri Aurobindo called it "supramental," so we can call it supramental to avoid confusion, because as soon as you say "Divine," people start thinking of a "God," and that spoils everything. It isn't like that. Not like that, it is the descent of the supramental world (<em>Mother slowly lowers her fists</em>), which is not mere imagination (<em>pointing above</em>): it is an ABSOLUTELY material Power. But (<em>smilingly</em>) with no need for any material means.</p>

<p class="P">On several occasions, my body felt a sort of new discomfort, an anxiety; and something, not exactly a voice but it became words in my consciousness, said, "Why are you afraid? This is the new consciousness." It happened several times. Then I understood.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You see, what in terms of human common sense says, "This is impossible, it's never been before," that's what is finished. This idiocy is over. It's become a stupidity. Now we could say: it's possible BECAUSE it has never been before. This is the new world and this is the new consciousness and this is the new Power; it is possible, and it is, and will be more and more manifest BECAUSE it is the new world, because it has never been before.</p>
<p class="P">It will be because it has never been before.</p>

<p class="P"><em>You feel so expanded, as if everything in you would blow up, but at the same time there's a sensation of being crushed ...</em></p>

<p class="P">Ahh!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Almost like a dream...</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes.</p>
<p class="P"><em>...compared to what there is now.</em></p>
<p class="P">So true!</p>
<p class="P">I really think the physical world is changing. People will probably notice it only in a few hundred years, because it takes a long time for it to become visible to the ordinary consciousness. But the touch (<em>Mother feels the air between her fingers</em>), feels... as if a different texture.</p>
<p class="P">From time to time, something tells me, "Don't talk, don't talk!" I have to keep quiet otherwise people around me would think I am becoming deranged.</p>
<p class="P"><em>!!!</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 192</p>
<p class="P"><em>You say it isn't the way you see the physical world that's changing but the very quality of matter?</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, yes, it's not at all my own way of seeing ‚Äì not at all.... I don't know.... But it's odd.</p>
<p class="P">You see, I have at the same time (to speak in the old way), at the same time the CONCRETE experience of a tre-men-dous Power and of total impotence.</p>
<p class="P">The old methods, the methods that even yesterday were effective and powerful, all seem nonexistent. Yet, side by side, when that Force comes, I concretely feel (and I have proof, a factual proof) that a simple expression of will, or even a simple vision of something is ... (<em>Mother lowers her hands</em>) all-powerful. Materially so. Some people on their deathbeds are returned to life; some healthy people, brrt, suddenly pass away ‚Äì to that extent, you know. Circumstances that seemed inextricable find marvelous solutions ‚Äì people themselves say it's miraculous. It's not miraculous to me, it's very simple: just like this (<em>Mother lowers a finger</em>). But it's INDISPUTABLE. Indisputable and new in the world. No longer the old method, no longer a mental concentration or a mental vision, none of that (<em>Mother lowers a finger</em>): a fact.</p>
<p class="P">A fact.</p>
<p class="P">I am myself still too much tied to... [people's thoughts]. Thank God (<em>Mother sweeps her hand across her forehead</em>), the mind is gone! Ah, you know, I am... what an extraordinary blessing it is! But from the ordinary external standpoint, I seem to have become an utter imbecile.</p>
<p class="P"><em>!!!</em></p>
<p class="P">It's good that I have someone like you near me who knows there's something else [than what they think].</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh, indeed! [laughing] Indeed, there's "something else"!</em></p>
<p class="P">And I feel such a force, you know.... When I rest, I don't sleep, I consciously enter that supramental activity, and.... Oh, mon petit!... I see myself doing things with such a fabulous power! And there's no longer any... you see, when I speak, I am forced to use "I," but it corresponds to nothing, it's... it's the Consciousness, it's a consciousness. A consciousness that knows and has power. Yes, a CONSCIOUSNESS; not a person but a consciousness ‚Äì a consciousness that knows and acts. And which uses this (<em>Mother</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 193</p>
<p class="P"><em> points to her body</em>) to keep a contact with people.</p>
<p class="P">Yes, that's it, it's not a person anymore ‚Äì sometimes, you know (<em>laughing</em>), I feel like a puppet (<em>gesture of dangling at the end of a string</em>) whose purpose is to enable contact with people. But the physical strength is like this (<em>wobbly gesture</em>).... I feel very strong ‚Äì very strong, and almost nonexistent. Both extremes together, you understand.... I must really look stupid.</p>
<p class="P">But there (<em>Mother stretches her arms upwards, then slowly extends them as if to embrace the universe</em>), it's luminous, it's clear, it's strong, it's wide.... Physically, too. It is PHYSICAL, that's what is amazing! Before, I used to withdraw into an inner state of being (I know them all, I've experienced them, I've had a conscious life), but all that, all that is... finished. Completely finished.... (<em>Smiling</em>) As if the physical world were becoming double.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="59" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P">Naturally, to the ordinary eye, I am still an old woman sitting in a chair and unable to move freely. Although at times, I suddenly feel that if I stood up, I could walk perfectly well.... But something tells me, "Patience, patience, patience..." So I wait.</p>
<p class="P">And there's a persistent idea (<em>hammering gesture</em>) that if I can reach, if my body can reach one hundred, it will become young again. It's very persistent, but doesn't come from me, it's like this (<em>hammering gesture from above</em>), so that I remain patient (although I am not impatient). Patience.</p>
<p class="P">From now to one hundred is six years?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, six years, Mother, it's not much.</em></p>
<p class="P">But the body's capacities will change BEFORE its appearance changes ‚Äì the appearance changes LAST; and I don't know, that never enters the picture. What really matters is how the Consciousness can use this. It's not that I will become young again, it's not "young," it's another type of capacity that will emerge and use this body. Will it transform it? Or will it use it for another purpose? That I don't know.... I don't know. Strangely enough, only when you are here do I speak or think about these things, as if it were necessary for someone to know ‚Äì otherwise, I never think about these things (<em>gesture of hands open</em>).</p>
<p class="P">Sometimes I spend hours in contemplation doing a very, very active work. Sometimes there are a few minutes... a few minutes of silence and contemplation... that last hours. And they seem like a few minutes. That's how it is.</p>

The SAME thing. Do you understand what I am saying? The SAME thing.</p>
<p class="P">For example, take that image I keep having of you sitting on that bench and staring at me like ‚Äì yes, as if saying, "What</p>

<p class="P"><em>Yes. Yes.</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>(Satprem:) Yes, Mother, you absolutely must have some sort of control over these people. I think the best way would be to call B. [SABDA], M. and Andr√© together, and have Andr√© spell out all the points in black and white.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, but Andr√© isn't combative.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Andr√©:) Yes, I am Mother! (laughter) I am convinced, but....</em></p>
<p class="P">No! I didn't say "convinced," I said "combative."</p>
<p class="P"><em>Combative? Oh, I am not at all combative, Mother!</em></p>
<p class="P">I know. That's just what I said.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I am not at all combative, because... I try to see through their eyes, and then I don't know who's right anymore!</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes! (<em>laughter</em>) That's exactly the point.</p>

<p class="P"><em>(Andr√©:) Yes, right.</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, yes! I ask them, you know. But they say I can't see anymore.... True, I can't see ‚Äì I see, but... it's a mixed vision. It's interesting (I wouldn't wish it on anybody, because the people who would see with it...). I see what is true in things from the supramental point of view. And it's extremely interesting. I hear sounds that people don't usually hear, because these sounds have a supramental reality. I can see.... When people talk to me, I see at the same time not only what they think (that's old hat), but what's true from the supramental point of view. All the time it is like that. Both together. Because my body has no longer the same... (what's the word?)... I am strong, but the old type of energy is gone; and the one that replaces it is far more powerful ‚Äì but I don't like to talk about it. When I do, I appear to be boasting. So I don't say anything.

<p class="Ps"><em>The "Formation of Death"</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>On several occasions since the beginning of this year 1972 ‚Äì and actually even in a conversation of September 8, 1971, where some of Mother's words had a strange ring to them ‚Äì Mother mentioned the "formation of death" she was up against. Today, again, in the following conversation, Mother speaks of that "formation."</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>In occult terms, a "formation" is a strongly "formed" thought, or a concentration of force with a specific goal and a permanent existence of its own. Formations can be negative or positive. In everyday life, for example, wills or desires or long-nurtured suggestions one day come to their happy or sorry fruition. The day, the success, or the "accident" were prepared by the constant repetition of insignificant little thoughts, which eventually exude their cancer or dazzling success. Thus Mother, who for long had had no "thoughts" or "will" of her own, except "what You will," was extremely sensitive and vulnerable to anything coming from the "outside," precisely because there was no more "outside" for her, she was directly and instantly bathed in everything: she was "in" people. "My body is excessively sensitive," she said, "and needs to be protected from all those things coming in. As if it had to work inside, as in an egg."</em></p>
<p class="Q">February 26</p>
<p class="P"><em>Herein, we are therefore trying to find out what happened on November 17, 1973: the why of things. A "tragedy" does not occur at a particular minute or hour in History. It is the result of all the hours and little minutes that have prepared that particular minute or made it inevitable. As I said earlier, I was thunderstruck on that November 18, 1973. I was certainly the blindest of all the characters taking part in the tragedy, for they all seemed to know in advance that she was going to die ‚Äì at least those in her immediate entourage. But that "knowing in advance" bears a terrible implication. Here we put our finger on the "formation of death" Mother was imbibing daily ‚Äì "a perpetual discomfort," she used to say. In those repeated little minutes we can pinpoint the cause of what happened at 7:25 p.m. on November 17,1973.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>There is no better eyewitness than Pranab, Mother's "bodyguard" since he was almost constantly physically present and even slept in Mother's room. Asked about the cause of Mother's departure, this is what he stated in a public speech on December 4, 1973 [in English]:</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 256</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>"On one side She had to fight the onset of decay and old age and on the other She was fighting against this dirt that we were constantly throwing upon Her. But more the failing body I hold responsible for what happened. Often I have seen that She was trying to counteract these forces but when She saw that She could not concentrate much, She could not talk much, She could not write much, She could not see people, She could not do as She wanted, because the body was failing, and the dirt and dust that we were throwing upon Her was increasing, increasing and increasing, I felt and I have seen also some kind of despair...."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>We know that all too well, alas: they thought she was old and disabled But Pranab adds the following, which suddenly gives us the magnitude of the real tragedy ‚Äì we could almost say the horror Mother had to face in her body. This is what he says, and let us remember we are today in August 1972:</em></p>

<p class="P">"This thing which came now [in November 1973], I think She had prepared me enough for it from quite a long time back. Long before, say, in the year 1948, when Sri Aurobindo was still living, She told me, "I am not willing to go, I will not go, and this time there will be no tragedy: but if it so happens that I leave my body, then put my body under the Service Tree".... And lately, say, AFTER 15th AUGUST 1972, I felt that perhaps what has happened was going to happen. I could not tell anybody and everybody, but to my close associates I said what I was feeling. Afterwards, I felt strongly that it was going to happen, I was counteracting this idea, saying that it should not happen. But behind everything the idea was there."</p>

<p class="P"><em>Thus, Mother was imbibing their thoughts of death: she was GOING to die. And for her this was no "thought": things had become "concrete" for her. Her body, the consciousness of her body felt itself in the grip of death.</em></p>

Humans only incarnate certain types of force or character ‚Äì they come, die, triumph and vanish ‚Äì but the forces remain and continue to animate millions and millions of unknown little humans here and there, who are silently "responsible" and the invisible actors in the drama. There is no one to put on trial here ‚Äì except millions who are but ourselves. It would therefore be absurd to say that Pranab was the author, or the sole author, of that "formation" ("Everywhere, there are wills</em></p>

Both formations are as... they're like this (<em>same gesture facing each other</em>) and....</p>
<p class="P">When this formation [of death] makes itself felt, an awareness comes that there's hardly any difference between life and physical death, in that anything, at any time, can send you over to the other side. Then, with the other formation, there's a feeling that... (how can I put it?) the body's frailty is due to a need for the consciousness to change so it can manifest the Supramental.</p>

<p class="P">Did you hear about the explosions on the sun?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">They say it's falling to the earth...</p>
<p class="P"><em>Ah?</em></p>
<p class="P">...and it's going to affect humans. Did you hear that?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I didn't hear it was falling to the earth.</em></p>
<p class="P">They say it will come to the earth and affect humans.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I think it affects the earth atmosphere, the weather, but that's all.</em></p>
<p class="P">I don't know.</p>
<p class="P"><em>It affects the atmosphere; for example, radio transmissions are scrambled. The atmosphere is affected, but that's about all.</em></p>
<p class="P">Is this today's news?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I don't know, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P">Because mine is today's latest news. They're rather pessimistic.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But what do you say?</em></p>
<p class="P">I say that it must be the supramental consciousness ‚Äì not</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 262</p>
<p class="P"> "consciousness": the supramental SUBSTANCE. And those who are ready will thus have their new body.</p>
<p class="P">That's my most... optimistic explanation.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Did you actually discern something outside of the official news?</em></p>
<p class="P">Not quite.</p>
<p class="P">For me, eating is getting more and more difficult ‚Äì almost impossible. Clearly, something has to replace food.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="72" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P">Almost, almost impossible to eat.</p>
<p class="P">Feeling has nothing to do with it, there's no disgust or anything of the sort: I just can't swallow. It's like this (<em>gesture of choking</em>). Result: I take nearly an hour to absorb what would normally take five minutes.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>So you think these solar eruptions are some kind of precipitation of the supramental consciousness on earth?</em></p>
<p class="P">Of the SUBSTANCE. The consciousness came long ago, but the thing is.... Because, for example, this body has the same needs it used to have; that's the way it is built: it needs to eat, but it can't eat. So when I was told these eruptions would affect even the human body, I thought: could it be the substance that will create the supramental body?</p>
<p class="P">If the Supramental is to manifest on earth, something of it has to relate to the physical.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Quite!</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">The body is in a curious condition (<em>Mother touches her fingertips</em>): it feels a terrible Force ‚Äì it is full of strength ‚Äì and it can't do a thing!</p>
<p class="P">It is in a bizarre kind of state.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 263</p>
<p class="P">I can write, but the way I see what I write is different from before.</p>
<p class="P">There you are.</p>
<p class="P">And what's your feeling?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, I feel the Force is more and more... imperative.</em></p>
<p class="P">Imperative. Yes, it's becoming terribly powerful, in a body which is... (<em>gesture of being miserable</em>). But the body does not feel weak, yet it isn't hungry. It isn't "hungry," that went long ago; but now, recently, it's become almost impossible to eat. How is one supposed to live, then?</p>
<p class="P">So when I was told that this solar explosion was heading for the earth and would affect people, I thought: well, maybe that's what is coming to replace food?</p>
<p class="P">It's <em>wishful thinking</em>, I can't say it's a knowledge. It just came to me like that.</p>
<p class="P">Because, according to what Sri Aurobindo said, the supramental body will be immortal and sexless ‚Äì that is, no procreation. So for those who live, if the earth is still there and they are to go on living, they will have to transform themselves constantly, otherwise they won't be able to last. Hence something has to replace food.</p>
<p class="P">Food carries in itself a seed of death, of decay. So obviously, it must be replaced by something else.</p>

<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>

<p class="P">Th√©on used to say that up to now there had been... that this was the seventh creation; there had been six creations before which were "reabsorbed" ‚Äì just as you said. And this one was the seventh, but it wouldn't be reabsorbed, it would transform itself. There we are. Instead of that of the sun which so far has ended in the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 266</p>
<p class="P"> disappearance of the creation, this time the creation would go on transforming itself, to manifest and become again the Supreme.</p>
<p class="P">Th√©on and Sri Aurobindo didn't know each other, you see, they never met each other, they didn't even know of each other's existence. Yet Th√©on proclaimed... (I don't remember what he called the new world) what Sri Aurobindo calls the "Supramental." What's remarkable ‚Äì interesting, you know, strikingly interesting ‚Äì is that without knowing each other, with totally different approaches, they reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p class="P">And we are precisely at the time when... the other creations had come to an end; but instead of coming to an end, this one will be transformed. How? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P">The interesting thing in man is that materially speaking, he is... a mere nothing, a second lost in eternity ‚Äì a tangled web of weaknesses ‚Äì but in terms of consciousness, he has the capacity to understand. His consciousness is capable of contacting the supreme Consciousness. So naturally there are all those who wanted to merge back into that Consciousness, but Sri Aurobindo said: the point is not to merge back into it but to make the world capable of manifesting that supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">Basically, it's that.</p>

<p class="P"><em>I think I'm well.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 274</p>
<p class="P">Well, so am I! (<em>laughter</em>)</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">I can clearly see that instead of thought governing life, it's consciousness. And when the consciousness remains quietly open to the Divine, all goes well. A lot of things constantly come into the consciousness, from the whole world, it would seem (<em>gesture of being assailed from all sides</em>): all the things that negate or oppose the divine Action. They keep coming all the time like this (<em>same gesture</em>). But if I can remain quiet (<em>gesture of offering, hands open</em>), in an attitude of... (<em>smiling</em>) nonexistence, a sort of... I don't know if it's transparency ‚Äì I don't know if one should say "transparency" or "immobility" ‚Äì but it's something in the consciousness that's like this (<em>same gesture of offering, hands open</em>). When it stays that way, all is well; but as soon as it starts stirring, that is, as soon as the individuality comes to the forefront in any way, everything becomes detestable. It's really too much.</p>
<p class="P">You see, the physical body has a millennium of past experiences that says, "Why, that blissful state is impossible!" ‚Äì this stupidity is what delays everything. It's as if the cells themselves, the cells of the body which are used to struggling and suffering, couldn't accept that things can be like this (<em>same gesture of surrender, hands open</em>). But when it is... then it's wonderful.</p>
<p class="P">Only it doesn't last. It's not daylong. Constantly, constantly things keep coming (<em>same gesture of being assailed from all sides</em>).</p>
<p class="P">But now I see quite well, quite clearly ‚Äì it's very clear: consciousness replaces thought.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">And... (how can I put it?) the difference between the two: thought is something that goes like this (<em>whirling, restless gesture</em>), ever in motion... whereas consciousness is like this (<em>gesture hands open, offered upward</em>). I can't explain it.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother closes her eyes, her hands remain open</em>)</p>

<p class="P"><em>I was wondering what I could do to accelerate the process. Everyday life is beset by so many harassing things.... What can one do to accelerate the process?</em></p>
<p class="P">If one could remain untroubled, it would make a big difference.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P">A big difference.</p>
<p class="P">You see, my body is beginning ‚Äì just beginning ‚Äì to know that the divine side means a life that's... (<em>Mother stretches out both arms in the vastness</em>) progressive and luminous; but there's an accumulation of past experiences which says, "Oh, that's impossible!" ‚Äì just like that. Well, that stupid "impossible" is what delays and spoils everything.</p>
<p class="P">The basis of the fact is that as soon as the body steps out of the right attitude things get painful: everything aches and is laborious ‚Äì you feel death and dissolution everywhere. And that's what reinforces... Matter's stupidity.</p>
<p class="P">So, really speaking, I'd rather not talk, unless it's to answer a specific question.</p>
<p class="P"><em>In my case, I wonder to what exact point I should apply myself?</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>after a silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">Do you feel you have gone beyond thought?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Oh yes, completely. The only thing left is mechanical thought, but otherwise.... I can say I never use the thinking process: I always feel I draw things from above. The speculative mind, for example, is just impossible for me.</em></p>
<p class="P">Well, it's good then, you're on the right track.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Well, maybe! But practically speaking, one is struggling with everything and feels a bit... submerged at times.</em></p>
<p class="P">As for me, you know, all the things I used to rely on for action seem to be PURPOSELY collapsing (everything, even the smallest things) so I can say: what You will. It's become... it's become my sole refuge.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 276</p>

<p class="P"><em>Yes, yes, Mother!</em></p>
<p class="P">A person with a superficial consciousness will understand in that way, but one with a deeper consciousness will understand the real meaning.</p>

<p class="P">Do you have anything to ask?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I had a question about Sri Aurobindo. I was wondering what stage he had reached when he left ‚Äì what stage in the transformation? For instance, what difference is there between the work you are doing now and what he was doing at the time?</em></p>
<p class="P">He had accumulated a great deal of supramental force in his body, and as soon as he left he.... He was on his bed, you see,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 327</p>
<p class="P"> and I was standing beside him, and all the supramental force that was in him passed quite concretely from his body into mine ‚Äì so concretely that I thought it was visible. I could feel the friction of the passage. It was extraordinary ‚Äì extraordinary! It was an extraordinary experience. It went on for a long, long time like this (<em>gesture of the Force passing into Mother's body</em>). I was standing beside his bed, and it passed into me.</p>
<p class="P">Almost physical ‚Äì it was a physical sensation.</p>
<p class="P">It lasted a long time.</p>
<p class="P">That's all I know.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But what I want to understand is at what stage he was in the inner work ‚Äì for example, cleansing the subconscient and all that? What difference is there between the work he had done at the time and where you have reached now, if you will? I mean, is the subconscient less subconscious or...?</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, yes! Certainly, certainly!</p>
<p class="P">But that is the mental way of looking at things, you see ‚Äì I don't have it anymore.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Perhaps the difference lies in the general or collective intensity of that Power, that Force?</em></p>
<p class="P">There is a difference in the POWER of the action.</p>
<p class="P">He himself ‚Äì he himself has a greater action, a greater power or action now than when he was in his body. Besides, that's why he left ‚Äì because it had to be done that way.</p>
<p class="P">It's very tangible, you know. His action has become very tangible. Of course, it isn't something mental at all. It is from another region. But it isn't neither ethereal nor ‚Äì is it tangible. I could almost say material.</p>
<p class="P"><em>I've often wondered about the right inner movement needed to go into that other region. There are basically two possible movements: a movement inwards in the direction of the soul, as it were, and a movement of annihilation of the individuality, in which you are in a sort of impersonal vastness.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 328</p>

And it doesn't follow my conscious will: I'll start eating, thinking, "I want to be finished in twenty minutes" ‚Äì and it takes me an hour!

<p class="Q">(<em>original English</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Dalai Lama:) It is my dream to have the perfect economic development of Tibet, the perfect organization, the efficiency that we find in Communism, but all this based upon, founded upon the Buddhistic qualities of Compassion and Love, so that the people in power do not degenerate into corruption. What is Mother's view of this dream, and whether such a thing will be realized in Tibet?</em></p>
<p class="P">It is not a dream. It will naturally be. But the time it will take, I do not know. This is something like what Sri Aurobindo has said about the Supramental.</p>
<p class="P">Truth, Love, Compassion will give a basis to the new creation. It is not birth but the value of men that should give the right to authority.</p>
<p class="P">If the teaching of Sri Aurobindo can spread over the world,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 353</p>
<p class="P"> and if there is the full manifestation of the Supramental, then the Supramental will be the power of the liberation of Tibet.</p>
<p class="P">It is bound to come, it will come; but if it goes as it is going now, it will take hundreds of years. But if the Supramental is manifested, it may come quick. Quick does not mean ten or twenty years ‚Äì that would be almost miraculous.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Kireet:) But the Supramental is now working very powerfully.</em></p>
<p class="P">It is, it is working. It will be manifested with enough power when the right people have the authority.</p>
<p class="P">For the moment, it seems that the opposition, the falsehood attacks with full power before dying. Never, never have men lied as much as they are doing now. It seems the old habit comes spontaneously. But it must be broken.</p>
<p class="P">We are at a very... what we could call an unpleasant moment of the history of the earth. It is interesting because the action is very powerful, but I can't call it pleasant.</p>
<p class="P">But I have told you that already; I wrote it.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="87" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="P"><em>(Kireet:) Yes, Mother. The Mother has given the message.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>(Dalai Lama:) As for myself, I have no desire to continue in power in the Government. For I feel that the Government involves so much of conflicts of parties, and the necessity of taking sides with one party against the other....</em></p>
<p class="P">One can govern without taking sides. That is the mistake of all the governments; they reduce their capacity tremendously.</p>
<p class="P">But beyond the mind, there is a higher and deeper consciousness ‚Äì they would find a Consciousness in which one can make use of all the capacities. It is a question of the consciousness being broad enough, so that each capacity can be put in its place in order to make a general harmony.</p>
<p class="P"><em>(Dalai Lama:) There is good will, there is sincerity among people all over the world, but the number of such people is not large.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 354</p>
<p class="P"> Will they be able to have an effect to change the conditions of the world?</p>
<p class="P">It is bound to change; it is bound to change. Only, if the people are sincere it will shorten the time; it will go faster if the people are sincere.</p>
<p class="P">The first and indispensable step is to stop all falsehood. Falsehood is all that contradicts in us the Presence of the Divine.</p>

<p class="P"> which we want to realize is a state of luminous understanding in which each person's needs as well as the harmony of the whole are taken into account.</p>
<p class="P">The future will have no need of violence because it will be governed by the Divine Consciousness, in which all things are harmonized and complement each other.</p>
<p class="P">For the moment, we are still in a stage where weapons are necessary. But it should be understood that this is a transitory stage, not a permanent one, and we must strive for the other one.</p>
<p class="P">Peace... peace and harmony will be a natural outcome of the change of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P">You see, in India there reigns the Gandhian concept of nonviolence which has replaced physical violence with moral violence, but it's far worse!</p>
<p class="P">But if you dare speak against Gandhi, everyone will immediately... oh!</p>
<p class="P">You don't need to mention his name, you can explain to the children that replacing physical violence with moral violence is no better. Lying down in front of a train to stop it running is a moral violence that can ultimately cause more disorder than physical violence.</p>
<p class="P">There would be a lot to say.... It depends on each case. I myself very much encouraged the practice of fencing because it gives you skill, control over your movements and discipline in violence ‚Äì I very much encouraged fencing at one time. I learned how to shoot; I used to shoot with a rifle, because it gives you steadiness and skill and a very good eye; and it forces you to remain calm in the midst of danger. All these things are.... I don't see why one should be <em>hopelessly nonviolent</em>, it only makes a spineless character.</p>
<p class="P">Turn it into an art! An art for cultivating calm, skill and self-control. There's no need to cry out indignantly as Gandhi would. It's useless, useless, absolutely useless ‚Äì I am not at all in favor of it! One should master the means of self-defense, and one should cultivate them in order to do so.</p>
<p class="P">Above all, make them understand that moral violence is just as bad as physical violence. It can even be worse, that is, at least physical violence forces you to become strong and control yourself, whereas moral violence is.... You may be like this [apparently quiet] and harbor the worst moral violence in yourself.</p>

Another day in 1971 (on December 4), she had said, "Only a violent death could stop the transformation, otherwise it will go on and on and on...."</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Therefore, there can be only two solutions to the mystery ‚Äì I was about to say "murder mystery," but can one call it by any other name? What other term could better elucidate the enigma? Assuredly, Mother had that horrid entourage, but it was in no way exceptional, neither in good nor in bad: the people around her exactly represented the average humanity and the ordinary physical consciousness, for which what she was doing was just questionable dreams and hallucinations. They all believed her old, senile or even "insane," and on the brink of death ‚Äì but could the beliefs of human pygmies get the better of that Consciousness? Of that Power? Of that Will? Could the attempt fail because of our belief or disbelief?</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Thus she was alone among them ‚Äì she was soon to be truly alone, from May 19 onward, exactly thirty-five days after the present conversation. I still hear Mother's son artlessly asking me, a few days after that May 19, "How will we communicate with Mother now?" "There will be NO MORE communication," I replied. He was flabbergasted ‚Äì not I. WHO could she "communicate" with? But as I said, I was positive that the experience would continue with or without communication: Mother was going to sever the nutrient link to the old physiology ‚Äì they did not let her. There remained cataleptic</em></p>

<p class="P"><em> trance, the fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty ‚Äì they did not want it. I can still hear the voice of the Brute: "No, I don't want to."</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>So?...</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Did she decide to leave? No one will ever convince me that Mother "decided," or that she was old, or insane, or incapable.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Did "the Lord decide"? Well, of course, it is He who decides in any case. But He also uses human instruments ‚Äì otherwise this world would have never existed ‚Äì and these human instruments have a freedom of choice, they are not mere puppets in the hands of "God" Or rather, to be more precise, they have a choice between being the Divine's puppet or the devil's ‚Äì and maybe BOTH ways conspire to lead us to an unforeseeable goal.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Hence, humans decided They said no to the trance, no to the experience, no to the fairy tale; they could not stand it anymore ‚Äì it had to stop.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>A particular fact has haunted me for the past seven years, a particular passage in Pranab's speech which he delivered a few days after Mother's departure. (Once again, I am not accusing anyone: I am chronicling History; I would like to report the facts, the words, the characters as accurately as I can ‚Äì I am Mother's scribe, that is all... and I love her, because it's lovely to love.) Now, in that speech, we find a small remark, the kind of remark one makes in passing, as the most "natural" thing in the world. Pranab is describing the "last days." You call them the "last days" AFTERWARDS, when the story is over ‚Äì in the meantime, it's just life as usual:</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>original English</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"At night [on November 14], She said, 'Make me walk.' We were very hesitant, but as She insisted, we lifted her up from the bed. She could not walk, staggered a little, almost collapsed. Seeing this, we put Her back in bed. We saw that Her face had become absolutely white and the lips blue. Then we decided that whatever She said, we must not take Her out from the bed again to walk. She took about 20 minutes to recover; She started saying, 'Lift me up again, I shall walk.' We refused. She asked why we were refusing. We said, 'Mother, you are in such a weak condition that it will do you harm.' Then She said, 'No, lift me up.' We did not. She began to plead, sometimes shout. All this continued until fifteen minutes past one. At that time we thought we would give Her some sedative, so that She might rest quietly. Then we gave Her SIQUIL as the doctor had prescribed. It took Her about 45 minutes to become quiet and She slept from 2 to 4 o'clock, but after getting up She started saying, 'Pranab, lift</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 403</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P"> me up and make me walk. My legs are getting paralysed; if you help me to walk again, they will become all right.' But we did not listen. She went on entreating till about 6 o'clock when She fell asleep."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, she fought like a lioness ‚Äì till the very end Is this the plea of someone "who has decided to leave"?</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>This was on November 14, three days before the "end"</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"On the 15th," Pranab reports, "at night again... She wanted us to help Her to walk, we refused to do that. We said, 'Mother, you should not walk.' She immediately obeyed us.... From that day She became absolutely obedient."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P"><em>How long had they been giving her SIQUIL? And what is SIQUIL, in the first place?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">4</a> A doctor friend of mine had explained to me: "It's a dangerous drug." But I could not believe in that kind of thing, it was simply too horrible.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Seven years later ‚Äì it took me seven years ‚Äì one day in September 1980, as I was passing a small local pharmacy on my way back from Madras, I decided to get to the bottom of it. I went in, asked for SIQUIL, pulled out the "directions" from the box and... read, dumbfounded:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">"Studies have revealed that over-sedation is not always necessary to benefit such psychotic symptoms as agitation, delusions, hallucinations or delirium. SIQUIL greatly simplifies home management of emotionally deranged patients, many of whom might otherwise previously have been hospitalized. These patients adopt a more realistic behavior, become less of a burden to their families and are more easily approached for training purposes and eventual rehabilitation.... SIQUIL is especially indicated in the treatment of severe acute and chronic mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, mania, depression, delirium, senile psychoses and psychoses caused by organic brain disease."</p>

<p class="P"><em>He enters. I too, as if I had the right to do so.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>We weave our way to the bottom of this room. I have a vague impression of a small window on the end wall. And in the left corner, is a richly decorated high throne. Seated in it is a Divinity.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>He is quite small in that huge throne (about two feet or so).</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>We walk. We walk on a narrow ridge by the side of a cultivated rice-field, which is to the right of us. It is green. I am nearest to it. The gentleman is the farthest. The Divinity is between us. He has a funny walk. He is so heavy (being made of solid gold) that he seems to lurch from side to side. I feel concerned and hold his arm to help him. I feel a tenderness also as for a child.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>Then I turn my face towards him to reassure him. But instead of me looking down it is he who looks down on me! I am really astonished to see how tall he has grown during this short walk of but a few steps! Now it is I who reach hardly his shoulder. He seems to have grown to a lad of 13 or 14.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>As I took up, he looks down at me and smiles. Ohh, what a smile! Utterly sweet and full of mischief. It contained a world: "You see, I am quite all right. Now you will see what fun we have!"</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>We walk on. To our left, sitting cross-legged, head bent, is M. [a disciple very learned in Sanskrit texts]. As we advance, I think, "What a pity, we shall pass right in front of him, but he would not even know WHO passed by!" But as we near, he raises his head and sees. I feel glad for M.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em>We walk on. Now the scenes change fast. We meet more and more people. Trees. Roads. Still more people. Wherever we go there is trouble, disturbance, confusion. As if the Godhead were sowing disruption</em></p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Sujata gives Mother a pale yellow, slightly golden hibiscus with a red heart. Mother holds the flower without seeing it. That day, I don't know why, I was full of questions.</em>)</p>
<p class="P">What is it?</p>
<p class="P"><em>It's "Ananda in the physical."</em></p>
<p class="P">!!! We badly need it!</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother!</em></p>
<p class="P">And you?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I was thinking about something Sri Aurobindo wrote.... In "Savitri," he clearly says, "Almighty powers are shut in Nature's cells."</em></p>

<p class="P">In...?</p>
<p class="P"><em>In the cells.</em></p>
<p class="P">Ohh!... Oh, that is interesting!</p>
<p class="P"><em>ALMIGHTY powers.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">He doesn't say anything else?</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, not on that subject.... The consciousness of the cells seems to be awakened but not the power.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother did not hear well</em>)</p>
<p class="P">You said the consciousness of the cells is... missing? No?</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, the consciousness is there. The consciousness of the cells is awakened, but the power isn't.</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah!... You said "awakened"?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. Because had the power been awakened, there wouldn't be any weakness in your body.</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="104" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P">No.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But it is THERE, Sri Aurobindo says it clearly: it is THERE, inside, within the very cells.</em></p>
<p class="P">Yes, there's no need to seek elsewhere.</p>
<p class="P"><em>But how to awaken it?</em></p>
<p class="P">Through faith, our faith.</p>
<p class="P">If one knows that and has trust.... But you see, my physical, my body is deteriorating very rapidly ‚Äì what could stop it from deteriorating?</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 419</p>
<p class="P"><em>Mother, I do NOT believe it is deterioration ‚Äì it's not. My feeling is that you are physically being led to a point of such complete powerlessness that the most complete Power will be forced to awaken....</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah!... you're right.</p>
<p class="P"><em>That Power will then be COMPELLED to come out.</em></p>
<p class="P">Or else I could... I could leave this body, no?</p>
<p class="P"><em>Ah, no, Mother! No, Mother, it must be done NOW.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>It must be done now.... You see, I am certain its NOT disintegration, not at all. It is NOT disintegration.</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="105" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother nods approvingly</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>You know, I have always seen that the other pole springs up from the most extreme opposite. So the supreme Power must spring up from the sort of apparent powerlessness you are in. By no means is it a disintegration.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P">What would you like now?</p>
<p class="P"><em>To stay with you, Mother, naturally.</em></p>
<p class="P">Like this? (<em>Mother takes Satprem's hands</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother plunges in for about ten minutes</em>)</p>
<p class="P">For me, you see, the question is food. More and more I find it impossible to eat. Can this body live without food?</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 420</p>
<p class="P"><em>Mother, I truly believe that you are being led to the point where something else will be FORCED to manifest.</em></p>
<p class="P">Eh?</p>
<p class="P"><em>I think you are led to the point ‚Äì the point of helplessness or powerlessness where something ELSE will be forced to manifest.</em></p>
<p class="P">Ah....</p>
<p class="P">Maybe.</p>
<p class="P"><em>As long as that point... of impossibility has not been reached....</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh, it's almost the point of impossibility.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, yes, that's also what I feel. I feel you're reaching that point, and something else is going to emerge.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P"><em>It is not at all the end; quite the contrary, it will soon be the beginning.</em></p>
<p class="P">I was told that the beginning would take place when I am a hundred; but that's a long way off!</p>
<p class="P"><em>No, Mother, I don't think it will take that long. I don't think so. I really don't think so. Another type of functioning is going to set in. But the end of the old has to be reached, and that end is the terrible part!</em></p>
<p class="P">Oh... I really don't want to say (<em>Mother shakes her head</em>), I don't want to insist, but... truly... (<em>Mother speaks with her eyes closed, all the pain of the world is in the shake of her head</em>).</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother. I understand, Mother, I understand Yes....</em></p>
<p class="P">The consciousness is clearer, stronger than it has ever been, and I look like an old....</p>
<p class="P"><em>Yes, Mother, it's "normal," if I may say so. We're going, you're</em></p>

<p class="P"><em>I don't speak out of "faith," Mother; it's really like something telling me: that's THE WAY.</em></p>
<p class="Q">(<em>Mother plunges in, she moans softly, leans forward and seems to be looking for something, then takes Satprem's hand again and goes off.</em>)</p>

<p class="Ps" style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"><em>And Now</em></p>
<p class="P">Then the door was shut.</p>
<p class="P">She was to live for another six months, 182 days.</p>
<p class="P">Two days before the ‚Äúend,‚Äù she kept repeating, ‚ÄúI want to walk...‚Äù</p>
<p class="P">Before my eyes, they drove twenty-five screws into her coffin. There was a ray of sun on the nape of her neck; her hands were tightly clasped together ‚Äì there was such strength in those hands! Such power in that supposedly dead body. And then that fierce concentration.</p>
<p class="P">She wore a white silk dress and a small blouse with gold buttons.</p>
<p class="P">The long saga unfolds before my eyes ‚Äì so many years with that young girl‚Äôs laughter rippling through everything, and the silences of snow, the beating of wings through boundless space, and the solid fire enfolding the body like concrete love. So many mysteries. ‚ÄúDeath is the problem given me to resolve.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P">Already night and silence have fallen over the little actors, their good and evil, their sorrow and petty affairs. Tomorrow this scribe, too, will return to the flame of love whence he came, and she, to the sweetness of the Ganges. But what about men? What about History? Still millions and millions of men destined to die? Still sorrow upon sorrow? When will there be undying love? When a lovely earth?</p>
<p class="P">Is it once again put off?</p>
<p class="P">‚ÄúA new way of dying ought to be possible,‚Äù she said in 1963. She spoke so much to me about ‚Äúdeath‚Äù ‚Äì Savitri, too, went into death to release Satyavan. But what is death?  That coffin? This tomb of gray marble where they go to place their flowers and light their incense, while going on with their petty affairs? But there, within... a mighty silence, there is a body molded of power, whose every cell has repeated year after year, second after second: OM Namo Bhagavateh, OM Namo Bhagavateh....</p>
<p class="P">So, is that all? Is this the end of the story?</p>
<p class="P">But Krishna in gold has shattered the chains of the old sanctuaries; rolling and frolicking, he strides along the roads of an old, laggard world, sowing chaos and dissension and confusion everywhere ‚Äì the inanity and illusion of everything: science and religion, ideals and medicine to patch up the old distressed carcass; everything is crumbling and collapsing; people speak a thousand languages but no one understands anybody; the heads of states</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 424</p>
<p class="P">look like clowns and clowns look like seers, and everything is the same in black or white, in Chinese or Russian or American. But Krishna winks: ‚ÄúJust wait.... ‚Äù The bomb? No. It would be too childish. The end of all illusions, the end of the human illusion ‚Äì this is more serious and very upsetting. What if everything was a deception? Medicine and the Holy See, Aristotle and Euclid and the perpetual duplication of the molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid ‚Äì what if things did not work that way at all?... An earthquake more earthshaking than all the Hiroshima bombs put together. The mental boat shipwrecked once and for all, and man flung on an unknown shore?... The periwinkle out of its shell. The world looked so complex and awesome and mathematical in that shell. No more shell, no more ‚Äúmathematics‚Äù ‚Äì just... just what?</p>
<p class="P">The most revolutionizing revolution in the world.</p>
<p class="P">Alexander and Lenin and Pompadour (and Einstein and the latest Nobel Peace Prize laureate) were so awesome... in a shell. But without the shell, it‚Äôs something else.</p>
<p class="P">A stupendous SOMETHING ELSE.</p>
<p class="P">‚ÄúI am on my way to discovering the illusion that must be destroyed so that physical life can be uninterrupted.... Death is the result of a distortion of consciousness.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P">What if everything were ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù in the mental waterhole we live in? What if all our science of life, our every step, our distance, our time, our eyes were all false? The eyes of a ladybug, then of a periwinkle, then of a man ‚Äì and then the eyes of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="P">Krishna in gold is breaking the old shell ‚Äì the shell of good and evil, hope and despair ‚Äì the shell of life and death. What if there were no more ‚Äúlife‚Äù and no more ‚Äúdeath‚Äù?</p>
<p class="P">Quite a staggering new look.</p>
<p class="P">But unrepentant men go on reciting the Gospel of the periwinkle and burning incense on gray- marble tombs and making babies and more babies, while Krishna in gold is pulling down the ceiling ‚Äì how are they going to awake from it all?</p>
<p class="P">In that tomb, some thousands and millions of cells are repeating the Mantra, tirelessly, relentlessly ‚Äì a new vibration is wearing down the partition walls of the world. Alone in that mighty silence, a small human form with her hands clasped together repeats the prayer of the world, repeats the cry of the earth, repeats.... They did not want her alive ‚Äì she is conquering death.</p>
<p class="P">The veil of illusion shrouding an unknown reality.</p>
<p class="P"> She is wearing down death from within.</p>
<p class="P">When our illusions are wholly gone, ‚Äúthat‚Äù will come.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 425</p>
<p class="P">‚ÄúI am walking a very thin line....‚Äù The world is walking a very thin line. Will it fall on this side or that side?</p>
<p class="P">It is perhaps time to decide what we want.</p>
<p class="P">My gaze is so intense, my heart so grieved that, at times, I seem to penetrate that tomb. And I seem to discern something very still staring at death straight in the face, and an indomitable will ‚Äì waiting.</p>
<p class="P">Waiting for our prayer to join hers.</p>
<p class="P">Mother, what do you have to say to these human offspring?</p>
<p class="P">On that November 18, 1973, she said something. I was stunned, aching from head to toe amid those hundreds and thousands of people staring at a ‚Äúdead body.‚Äù The fans were droning, the neon lights were glaring; there was a scent of incense and jasmine in the air; they were making her coffin with all dispatch. But my heart was filled with such an enormous ‚ÄúThis-is-not-possible,‚Äù as if the entire earth and all the sorrowful men of this earth were crying out in my heart. So then, this was the ‚Äúend,‚Äù as it always was ‚Äì as at Thebes and Babylon and Buchenwald. It was the end. And we start all over again. It was so overwhelmingly not-possible. Never, ever will I go through it again. Never, ever will there be ‚Äúanother time‚Äù with its sorrow and prayers and fruitless pain of being. There were a thousand men in my heart, all alike, who had waited and waited for THAT MOMENT. And there was no moment. We will have to come again in another life and learn again about Euclid and the law of gravity, and sorrow and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù ‚Äì and end up in a hole again? I was so broken, shattered on that November 18 ‚Äì there was only a splitting headache and a blank look staring and staring at that procession of dead people. But, suddenly, I had the most stupendous experience of my life. I who had so much complained to Mother of never having any ‚Äúexperience‚Äù! I was in no condition to have an experience, or concentrate or pray, or will anything ‚Äì I was nothing but a headache, an aching body, a kind of frightful nonentity staring at a small white form. An unintelligible masquerade. It was false, screamingly false. A dream. Not real.</p>
<p class="P">All of life was not-real.</p>
<p class="P">Then she lifted me in her arms. She lifted me above my headache, lifted me above that crowd, above all those meaningless little bodies. And I was in a sound-burst. I entered a stupendous peal of bells ‚Äì vast as the universe, exceeding all universes, all lives, all bodies, and yet WITHIN ‚Äì A colossal ringing that swept away the worlds, swept away the pains, swept away the whys and the hows; I was one with that formidable SOUND ringing over the universe:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 426</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P">NO OBSTACLE, NOTHING WILL STOP...<br/>
   NO OBSTACLE, NOTHING WILL STOP...<br/>
   NO OBSTACLE, NOTHING WILL STOP...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P">...ringing and ringing. The whole world was ringing in a torrent of rapturous, irresistible, triumphant joy. NOTHING WILL STOP....</p>
<p class="P">It was the inevitable new world.</p>
<p class="P"><em>Here.</em></p>
<p class="P"><em> Done.</em></p>
<p class="P">My whole body was trembling.</p>
