<h2>Mother‚Äôs Agenda</h2>
<h3>1970</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document  ‚Äî  6,000 pages in 13 volumes  ‚Äî  is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death  ‚Äî  upon the very power that changes death  ‚Äî  and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Continuation of the conversation of 31 December 1969 about Auroville and the Matrimandir.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-4"><em>Mother, I told Paolo [the Italian architect] to come, he is waiting outside.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-5">Yes.... There is an interesting thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-6">For a long time I had been feeling something, then we spoke about it the other day, and I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAW</span>... I told R. [Auroville's architect] about it, I asked him to see Paolo, and I also told him that I had seen what should be done. Naturally, he didn't say no, he said yes to everything, but I felt he wasn't too keen.... But here is what happened. I clearly saw ‚Äì very, very distinctly saw, which means it was like that, and it still <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span> like that, it's there <em>(gesture showing an</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 16</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-7"><em>eternal plane)</em> ‚Äì the inside of that place [the Matrimandir].</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-8"><em>Maybe you should tell Paolo about it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-9">Tell him right now?... All right.... I'll speak more easily if I am alone with you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-10"><em>Fine, then, Mother.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-11">I could describe it. It came like this. It will be a kind of hall which will be like the inside of a column. No windows. Ventilation will be artificial, with this kind of machinery <em>(Mother points to an air conditioner),</em> and just a roof. And sunlight striking the center; or, when there is no sunlight (at night or on overcast days), an electric spotlight. The idea is to build right now an example or a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù for a hundred people or so. Once the city is built and the experiment is made, we will make a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BIG</span> thing of it ‚Äì but then it will be very big, for one or two thousand people. And the second one will be built around the first, which means that the first will go only when the second is built.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-12">There's the idea.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-13">Only, in order to tell Paolo about it (and if possible, if I see it's possible, to tell R. about it), I wanted to have a plan. I'll have it made ‚Äì not myself, I can't do it anymore; I could have done it in the past, but now I don't see clearly enough. This afternoon, I'll have it made in front of me, and with that plan, I'll be able to explain really well. But to you I simply wanted to say what I have seen....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-14">It will be a tower with twelve facets ‚Äì each facet representing one month of the year ‚Äì and the top, the roof of the tower will be like this <em>(Mother makes a gesture showing something like this:)</em>
<img alt="Agenda Image" class="cover-image" height="111" hspace="20" src="static/HTML/Agenda_11_images/img31.jpg" vspace="20" width="334"/>
</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-15">Then, inside, there will be twelve columns ‚Äì the walls and twelve columns ‚Äì and right at the center, on the floor, my symbol, with, above it, four symbols of Sri Aurobindo joining in a square, and above... a globe. A globe possibly made of a transparent substance, with or without a light inside, but the sun will have to strike this globe; so, depending on the particular month or hour, it will be from here or there or there... <em>(gesture showing the sun's course)</em>. Do you understand? There will always be an opening with a sunbeam. Not a diffused light, but a beam that will have to come and strike the globe. That requires
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 17</p>
<p class="PE"> technical knowledge for its execution, and that's why I want to make a drawing with an engineer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-16">But inside, there will be neither windows nor lights, it will always be in a sort of clear half-light, night and day: during the day with sunlight, at night with artificial light. And on the ground, nothing, except for a floor like this one [in Mother's room], that is, first a wooden floor (wooden or something else), then a sort of thick rubber foam, very soft, and then a carpet. A carpet covering everything, except for the center. And people will be able to sit anywhere. The twelve columns are for those who need a backrest!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-17">But then, people will not come for ‚Äúregular meditations‚Äù or anything of the kind (the internal organization will be taken care of later): it will be a place for concentration. Not everyone will be allowed in; there will be a time of the week or the day (I don't know) when visitors will be allowed, but anyway without mixture. There will be a fixed hour or day to show the visitors, and the rest of the time only for those who are... serious ‚Äì serious, sincere, who truly want to learn to concentrate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-18">So I think that's good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-19">It was there <em>(gesture of vision above),</em> I still see it when I talk about it ‚Äì I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEE</span>. As I see it, it's very beautiful, really very beautiful.... A sort of half-light: you can see, but it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> peaceful, and with very clear and strong beams of light on that globe (the projected, artificial light will have to be slightly golden, it shouldn't be cold ‚Äì it will depend on the spotlights). A globe that will be made of plastic or... I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-20"><em>Crystal?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-21">If possible, yes. For the smaller temple, the globe won't need to be very big: if it were this big <em>(about one foot),</em> it would be enough. But for the bigger temple, it will have to be big.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-22"><em>But how will the bigger temple be built? Over the small one?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-23">No, no, the small one will go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-24"><em>Oh, it will go, another one will be built.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-25">But the big temple will be built afterwards, and then on a huge scale.... The smaller one will go only once the bigger one is built. But of course, for the city to be completed, we must allow some
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 18</p>
<p class="PE"> twenty years (for everything to be in order, in its place). It's the same with the gardens: all the gardens that are being prepared are for now, but in twenty years, all that will have to be on another scale; then it will have to be something really... really beautiful. And I wonder what substance that globe should be made of, the big one?... The small one could be made of crystal: for a globe this size <em>(gesture about one foot)</em> I think it will do. The globe will have to be visible from every corner of the room.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-26"><em>It shouldn't be too high above the floor either, should it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-27">No, Sri Aurobindo's symbol doesn't have to be very big, it has to be this size....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-28"><em>Ten to twelve inches?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-29">At the most, at the very most.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-30"><em>So it would be more or less at eye level.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-31">At eye level, yes, that's right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-32">And a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> peaceful atmosphere. And <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOTHING</span>, nothing but big columns.... There remains to see whether the columns' style... whether they will be round, or themselves with twelve facets...? But <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TWELVE</span> columns.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-33"><em>And a roof with two sides?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-34">Yes, a roof with two sides so as to get sunlight.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-35">It will have to be so arranged that rainwater can't get in. Something that needs to be opened and closed every time it rains won't do, it's not possible; it will have to be in such a way that rainwater can't get in. But sunlight must get in <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AS A BEAM</span>, not diffused. So the opening will have to be limited.... It requires a clever engineer, who knows his job really well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-36"><em>When would they start?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-37">I'd like them to start immediately, as soon as we have the plans. But there are two questions: first the plans (workers can be found), and then money.... I think it can be done with this idea of building a small specimen (‚Äúsmall,‚Äù well, it's a manner of speaking, because
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 19</p>
<p class="PE"> to hold a hundred people easily it will still have to be big enough), a small specimen to begin with. While building the small specimen we'll learn, and we'll build the big one when the city is finished ‚Äì that won't be right now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-38">I told R. about it, and the next day he told me, ‚ÄúYes, but it will take time to prepare.‚Äù (I said nothing of all I've just told you, I just spoke of doing something.) Afterwards I had a vision of that room, so I no longer need anyone to see how it should be ‚Äì I know. What's needed is an engineer more than an architect, because an architect... It has to be as simple as possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-39"><em>I told Paolo what you had seen, that large room, empty, without anything. It touched him a lot, he in fact could see that large empty room. He understands quite well. So ‚Äúempty‚Äù simply means a shape.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-40">But a shape... like a tower, but... (that's why I wanted to have a sketch to show) twelve regular facets, and then we need a wall that's not straight, a wall slightly like this <em>(gesture of a slight slope),</em> I don't know if that's possible. And inside, twelve columns. So we'll have to find a way to capture sunlight, so that at any time of the year sunlight can get in.... We need someone who knows his job well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-41">As for the outside... I didn't see the outside; I didn't see it at all, I only saw the inside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-42">I wanted to explain to Paolo once I would have the papers, it would be easier, but since you called him...</p>
<p class="Ps"><em>(Sujata goes out and comes back with Paolo, who comes in with a garland of pink ‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù Mother gives him an orange hibiscus ‚Äì Auroville's flower ‚Äì looks at him, and starts speaking:)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-43">Since we decided to build that temple, I have seen ‚Äì I have seen the inside. I have just tried to describe it to Satprem. But in a few days I will have plans and drawings, so I'll be able to explain more clearly. Because I don't know at all how the outside is, but the inside I know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-44"><em>(Paolo:) The outside comes out of the inside.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-45">It's a kind of tower with twelve regular facets representing the twelve months of the year, and absolutely empty.... Only, it will
</p>

It's a kind of perception: there is no more differentiation of the organs <em>(Mother touches her eyes, her ears)</em>. And it's a perception... yes, which is total: it's at the same time (if you want to explain it), at the same time vision, hearing, and knowledge. A perception... something that is a new type of perception. So then, you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span>. It replaces learning.

I did see, I did have perceptions of the superman, the intermediary being, but you clearly feel it's only an intermediary being. What will that being be like who will come after the superman? I don't know.... Because we are still much too human; when we visualize the Supreme Consciousness in a form, the Supreme Being and so on ‚Äì the Supreme ‚Äì we tend to give it a form similar to the human one, but that's our old habit.... I saw that future being (I saw it many years ago): it was clearly a far more harmonious and expressive form than the human one, but there was a likeness, it was still a human form, that is to say, with a head and arms and legs and... Will it be that? I don't know. There will necessarily be that as an intermediary ‚Äì necessarily. There were all those kinds of apes which acted as intermediaries between the animal and man.... But lightness, invulnerability, moving about at will, luminosity at will ‚Äì all that goes without saying, it's part of supramental qualities, but... Oh, yes, also clothing at will: it's not something foreign added on, it's the substance that takes on certain forms.... All that I had seen, and I told Sri Aurobindo about it, and Sri Aurobindo himself gave me certain demonstrations (I see him sometimes and he shows me). He simply said what the intermediary step will be. But all descriptions are worthless.

I didn't see them white, I saw them with an undefinable color, between gold and orange. A color of that sort. They will stand upright, carved in stone. And a globe not transparent but translucent. Then, at the bottom [of the globe], a light will be projected upward and will enter the globe diffusely. And from outside, rays of light will fall onto the center. No other lights: no windows, an electric ventilation. And no furniture, nothing. A place... to try and find one's consciousness.</p>

<p class="PE">The work in the body is going on at a quickened pace, but it's not easy... But very precise, very accurate. I told you that I spent a whole night with Sri Aurobindo, and he explained to me all that's going on for the body, in detail....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-692">It's difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-693">The state one used to find natural now so much feels like a state of perfect imbecility, so... and everything one used to lean on now feels like nothing at all. So it's... difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-694">Things... it's so interesting! We always think that certain things are dangerous (certain illnesses, for example, or certain disorders) and others are insignificant, and then it's shown in an absolutely irrefutable manner that it doesn't at all depend on this, that... all absolutely depends (to put it intelligibly) on what has been decided, on what the Supreme Lord has decided. With the slightest thing, an absolutely insignificant trouble. He can stop the body's functioning, while something regarded as incurably serious passes off without importance. And it's demonstrated in practice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-695">There are troublesome moments. Because mental convictions, mental constructions help the body a lot, and now it no longer has any, so it no longer has that facility. For instance, when you have a mental faith ‚Äì what's called faith ‚Äì it helps you a lot, because it remains without budging through all difficulties... but that's not there anymore! It's only the Consciousness, but then the Consciousness... <em>(smiling)</em> the Consciousness makes no fuss. The Consciousness doesn't talk nonsense, it doesn't tell you stories at the desired moment in order to help you ‚Äì it's like this, as it is <em>(gesture like an immutable presence)</em>, in its absolute simplicity and sincerity. So you see very well, you know very well, but...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-696">The body sees very well, it also sees that its sensations are evidently... almost made up, which means that they don't really correspond to the truth ‚Äì but... <em>(laughing)</em> that doesn't help it much!... At times it really feels ill at ease.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-697">It has become so conscious of its own imbecility that... the first effect was to say, ‚ÄúIt's <em>hopeless;</em> it has to dissolve for something else to take the place.‚Äù And then there's always that Smile looking on here, making no fuss.... So... so it tries to be still.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-698">You see, it has gone beyond the stage of imbecility where you say, ‚ÄúWhy are these things like this?‚Äù ‚Äì It sees clearly, sees very well why they are like this. But things are so vast, so general that... It's difficult for the body consciousness to remain in that state of universality all the time.</p>

<p class="PE">To make a sentence (because all this looks like sentences), it's knowing that one lives in a falsehood, knowing what that falsehood is, knowing, in flashes, what the Truth is, and yet being unable to... adjust the two. And seeing why. Because there's a whole path to travel so this falsehood can abdicate before the Truth, can be transformed into Truth, and in a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span> way ‚Äì not arbitrarily but truly. So that requires all kinds of experiences, adjustments, and for us here, it means time, it needs time. It can't be done instantly. And when the body sees, when it becomes conscious of its imbecility, it would like, it aspires for that to disappear instantly, so things grate.</p>

So it's like that, it sees what a tremendous work this is, what difference there is between what it is and what it ought to be, and at the same time, without knowing whether it will be capable of doing the work or not. What's expected of it? It is told what's expected of it from one minute to the next; that it's told very clearly, so it does it, and so at times it can let itself go <em>(Mother stretches her arms in the Great Rhythm)</em>, and then things are fine, but...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-705">It's a curious thing. When I am in that state, I am not asleep yet I am not awake; it's neither one nor the other. It's a sort of new state I have; whether I am in my bed or sitting in my armchair makes no difference. It's a certain state I go into, in which I know things in such a clear way, and then (as I did with you) I explain them. Then when I go out of that state, pfft! finished.... It's curious. Nights are very short ‚Äì very short ‚Äì yet when I go to bed, its hardly nine, I think, and I get up at 4:30, which is a long time. Yet it's very short. You understand, I don't sleep the way people do (but not at all), and I am not awake. It's something else. And then, things are evident, very easy to understand, I can explain them (as I explain them to you), and it's a perfectly natural phenomenon ‚Äì there was no surprise at meeting you (it wasn't ‚Äúmeeting,‚Äù you were there), and I told you things. And then, pfft! finished. Suddenly I'll cough or have a pain here, there, and then... you fall back into this ordinary imbecility.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-706">Sometimes it's like that when I am simply sitting there, in my armchair.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-707">But then, the funny thing is that I hear very clearly, see very clearly, but it's evidently not with these senses because, for instance, right now I don't hear well and don't see clearly. But at such times... And I remember that I do things; for example, when I am with Sri Aurobindo at night, it's with that consciousness; now, materially, my body is stooped ‚Äì at night it was perfectly normal! Yet I don't sleep! What is it? I don't know. There's something there.... Is it possible?</p>

It came back, but... when it came back, when the body saw it, it saw it as one sees a falsehood. And I understood how much it had changed, because when it saw the formation, its impression... it looked at it with a smile and the impression: ah, an old formation now devoid of truth. It was an extraordinary experience: that thing, its time is over. Its time is over.

Now that appears to be the human summit, but it's quite... what we might call a ‚Äúcentral region‚Äù <em>(gesture hardly above ground level)</em>, it's not at all a higher region.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-991">421 ‚Äì There are four stages in the pain God gives to us; when it is only pain; when it is pain that causes pleasure; when it is pain that is pleasure; and when it is purely a fiercer form of delight.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 124</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-992"><em>¬† You answer:</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-993">‚ÄúIf Sri Aurobindo refers to moral pain, whatever it may be, I can say from experience that the four stages he speaks of correspond to four states of consciousness that stem from the inner development and the degree of union with the divine consciousness obtained by the individual consciousness. When the union is perfect, there only remains the ‚Äòfiercer form of delight.‚Äô</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-994">‚ÄúIf he refers to physical pain endured by the body, the experience does not follow so clearly defined an order, all the more so as union with the Divine most often causes the pain to disappear.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-995">Yes, that's my experience, that's what I told you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-996">I don't know whether he was actually referring to physical pain?... How does he put it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-997"><em>‚Äú...A fiercer form of delight.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-998">That experience I had it in 1912 (1912 or '13, I don't remember), in Paris. I was in Paris. Once, I had an anxiety about someone who was to travel to Paris and arrive at a certain time; time was passing and passing, and the person didn't arrive. Then, at one point, I had a sort of anguish, I wondered what had happened. And that anguish suddenly... You see, I was already conscious of my psychic being (I had been for a long time), and that anguish suddenly became extraordinarily intense, and it made <em>(bursting gesture)</em> like fireworks ‚Äì a marvel! So I understand what he means by <em>‚Äúa fierce form of delight.‚Äù</em> But it was purely psychological, it wasn't physical.... 1912 or '13.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-999">But physically, the body's whole experience now is that it only has to... to give itself unreservedly, to abandon itself totally to the divine Presence, and the pain, any pain at all, disappears.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1000">That I said the other day.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1001">It's not at all that it turns into something else: it disappears. And on a physical level, it's more important because, along with the pain, the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAUSE</span> disappears too. Which means that the disorder that had occurred is dissolved, it no longer exists. That's why I don't think Sri Aurobindo is referring to physical things, because in the physical, experiences are different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1002">Psychological or inner things, even sensations (sensations about
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 125</p>
<p class="PE"> events, not about the body), have a fluidity, they're quite different in character. Things of the body have a sort of... (what shall I call it?) maybe a concrete stability or fixity, I don't know. For example, if you have a pain somewhere (say in the heart or lungs or... some pain), it corresponds to something within, something that happened, a disorder, and the pain (when you are in a tranquil state) corresponds to what we might call the ‚Äúsituation‚Äù of the cells, so when the pain disappears it means the cells are back in place ‚Äì it doesn't mean that the disorder is continuing but you no longer feel it, that's not it. So it's not the sensation you have that changes, it's the material <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FACT</span> that has changed. And that I find much more marvelous: the contact with the true Force puts things back in order.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1003"><em>Yet, usually with physical things, one feels it takes a little time to ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1004">But that's because the cells are not used to surrendering, to giving themselves. Once the cells are conscious and give themselves, I have noticed that things can go really very fast. But it may depend on the kind of disorder; I suppose, for instance, that a broken bone may need some time to be repaired.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1005">I once broke this little bone <em>(Mother points to the little finger of her left hand)</em>. Sri Aurobindo was there and I told no one except him (especially no doctor). I didn't bandage it, didn't do anything, I just kept it straight. There was even a time when I could feel the knitting of the bone (it made a slight lump, as it always does), but that too disappeared. But it took... I don't remember exactly (that was long ago, he was there), but I simply took care not to move my finger (it was the left hand), and it knitted together without bandage or anything, like that, relatively fast, and without leaving <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ANY</span> trace. It was broken.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1006">It was broken, but the bones hadn't moved apart. I could feel the fracture ‚Äì a month later it was over (I forget exactly how many days). And broken obviously means something very concrete!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1007">But I don't know if, for instance, in the body's present state, it wouldn't happen much faster. I don't know. But now, it's a thoroughly conscious and almost ‚Äúmethodical‚Äù work, I might say, which is inflicted on the body so that one part after another, and all the parts and all the groups of cells may learn... true life.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 126</p>
<p class="PE"> But there is one thing.... In what he wrote, in what he told me, Sri Aurobindo seemed to take as a sign of the transformation the constant presence of Ananda [bliss].... And that was one of the things I told him about: the being manifesting in this body, and consequently the body (because even from a very young age, the body had tried to surrender to the inner being, not to remain independent), in the body itself, there had never been either the feeling or the need, or even the intent of living in Ananda. Since it was very small, the body was built with... I might put it like this: ‚Äúthe will to do what had to be done‚Äù ‚Äì to be what it had to be and to do it. When it was very small, the object of the surrender was not known, but the minute it knew it, for it that was very definitive.... You understand, the first contact (as I said) was the divine Presence in the psychic being, and so, the minute it became a fact ‚Äì a patent fact, there was no arguing, the experience was perfectly conclusive ‚Äì from that minute, the body had only one idea left (not even one idea, one will), to be what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> wanted it to be.... Now, for it, it's beyond any possible discussion: it's like this <em>(gesture hands open)</em>, simply attentive and anxious to do what the Divine wants it to do, and it tries more and more not to feel any difference. That's beginning ‚Äì it's not yet there everywhere. In many parts of the body, there is only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> thing left: there is not the Thing that wants and the thing that obeys, it's no longer like that ‚Äì only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> Vibration. It's beginning. But it doesn't expect it to result in a sense of delight or Ananda or... In fact, it's quite indifferent to that. It was born and formed quite indifferent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1008">I said that to Sri Aurobindo. <em>(Laughing)</em> He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúThere aren't two people like you on earth!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> Because, he says, people may overcome the need to be happy (not ‚Äúbe happy,‚Äù that doesn't mean anything), anyway the need of satisfaction, of Ananda, but for it to be spontaneous...! Like that, effortless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1009">No merit! It was quite natural.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1010">That's why that famous question [‚Äú<em>Is the aim of life to be happy</em>?‚Äù], for the body itself, it's such an obvious thing! If it were told, ‚ÄúYou were born to be happy...‚Äù <em>(Mother stares in surprise)</em>, it doesn't understand!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1151">‚ÄúThe physical Nature does not mean the body alone but the phrase includes the transformation of the whole physical mind, vital, material nature ‚Äì not by imposing Siddhis [occult powers] on them, but by creating a new physical nature which is to be the habitation of the supramental being in a new evolution. I am not aware that this has been done by any Hathayogic or other process. Mental or vital occult power can only bring Siddhis of the higher plane into the individual life ‚Äì like the Sannyasi who could take any poison without harm, but he died of a poison after all when he forgot to observe the conditions of the Siddhi. The working of the supramental power envisaged is not an influence on the physical giving it abnormal faculties but an entrance and permeation changing it wholly into a supramentalised physical. I did not learn the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 144</p>
<p class="PE"> idea from Veda or Upanishad, and I do not know if there is anything of the kind there. What I received about the Supermind was a direct, not a derived knowledge given to me; it was only afterwards that I found certain confirmatory revelations in the Upanishad and Veda.‚Äù</p>

In ordinary life, normally you live while being as little concerned with your body as possible; it's an automatically functioning instrument.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1210"><em>I don't know if it's a ‚Äúquestion,‚Äù but ...I don't very well understand the working of the subtle physical, or the relationship between the subtle physical and the material physical.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1212">... and that we too, at night, through a part of our being, often work there to prepare... what is to come. How?... </p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1213">Listen, your question comes at the right moment. Last night, for the first time ‚Äì really the first time ‚Äì it wasn't a dream, I wasn't asleep, yet there was a whole story (which I am going to tell you), and I was absolutely convinced at the time that it was something going on here (maybe not in that form, but in a similar form). Then I realized that nothing had taken place here (outwardly at least, there was no sign of it).... Giving the names bothers me; I won't tell the names, it doesn't matter. But the names were there, the people, all of it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PRECISE</span>, as it is here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1214">I forget how it started, but I was very ill, seriously ill, and my body wasn't asleep, yet wasn't awake (that's a fairly normal state now: I'll be absorbed in a consciousness, which I think is the consciousness of the subtle physical; at least I was there last night). So then, I was very ill, but I knew it wasn't this body (but it was this body's consciousness), it was a family at the Ashram, and the father was seeking help, looking for a doctor (all the details with such precision!...). And while that was going on, the body said to itself, ‚ÄúSo I am identified with this person, since he is treating this</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 150</p>
<p class="PE"> person (me, that is); and since I am identified, I must do in this person what needs to be done.‚Äù Then I concentrated and called the forces of the Lord, and treated the person. All that down to the last detail. It lasted for two hours. At the same time, I saw people who were extraordinarily interested in the event, looking on; for instance, among them, not to name him, there was Nolini, bent over like that and looking <em>(Mother opens her eyes wide)</em> to try and understand what was going on. Which means it was taking place in a world that had the full appearance ‚Äì full appearance ‚Äì of the material world, but in which people were conscious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1215">I'm not recounting all the details, but my body <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FELT</span> the battle of the illness. And at the same time it knew it wasn't its own body, you understand? It was like that, a very complex, very precise consciousness, with a great force. And all of it going on at the same time ‚Äì I wasn't asleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1216">This morning I expected to be told that something very serious had taken place in that family (there are three sick people in it, three women), that something had happened to one of them. And nothing has happened!... But that was a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FACT</span>, I mean it was lived in every detail, with an absolutely clear consciousness, and it was in the subtle physical. But... but I tell you, I felt, the body felt very, very ill. Yet at the same time, it knew it was someone else's illness. And it took the attitude, it said, ‚ÄúThis is taking place so I take the necessary attitude for this person.‚Äù And all of it fully conscious. It took the attitude and kept it like that for two hours.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1217">There's only one possibility: it happened during the night, when those people were asleep, and they didn't realize.... You understand, this body's impression is that it has saved someone's life.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1219">I don't know about the end. I ‚Äúwoke up,‚Äù came back to the ordinary consciousness. At one point I had to get up, and... it rather was a relief for the body, because it was suffering. Afterwards, it didn't suffer anymore. But that was because the work was over.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1220"><em>Yes, nothing took place in the physical because you stopped the thing in the subtle physical.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1221">Quite possible. But it's... Never, never have I lived so totally in the subtle physical, fully conscious, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WITHOUT SLEEPING</span> (I was lying</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 151</p>
<p class="PE"> on my bed), and it lasted for two hours. Things were as real, as precise as they are here.... And the same will: it's not another will, it's the same; it's the divine Will through the psychic working in this body. So it acts there or here without difference. In other words, whether I am in this subtle physical or in the material physical, it's the same will, the same psychic will that acts ‚Äì the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span>, exactly in the same way. Which means that... I don't know what the difference is. There's a difference... it's thin, you don't feel it's something thick or heavy: it's thin. That union between the two, between the subtle physical and the material physical, is taking place all the time ‚Äì day and night and day and night. The work is... You might almost say that there is an attempt to substitute one for the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1222">And, you know, the faces, expressions, gestures, movements, words ‚Äì as precise, as precise as they are here. It seems to be a response... because I asked (it was yesterday, I think, sometime yesterday; in fact when I sit like that, as I was with you the other day, the two worlds are fused <em>[Mother holds the fingers of her right hand between those of her left hand]</em>, you can't feel the difference), I asked Sri Aurobindo whether things are as precise and exact; so he told me yes, he answered yes, but said I had to experience it. And I had that experience last night, quite unexpectedly. It was around three in the morning (between two and three).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1223">So then, I saw this morning one person from the family in question, who could have been one of those seriously ill ‚Äì she didn't mention anything, didn't say anything.... So maybe it began in sleep for her and the action [of Mother] was enough to cure her without her realizing it. It's possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1224">You understand, it's the kind of consciousness that says, ‚ÄúMy body is suffering,‚Äù but it wasn't my body, it was someone else's body. It said, ‚ÄúI am suffering, but I know it's not me, it's the suffering of one member of this family‚Äù (I didn't try to find out which), ‚Äúand that's why ‚Äì it's because I must do what I would do in my own case.‚Äù And I did it, it lasted for two hours.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1225">It's the first time. It's like that every night, but fleeting, it comes for one detail, for a moment; the rest of the time I am in perfect Peace. It's the first time I've had an action of this sort. And I was so ill (!) that I wondered (while it lasted), I wondered if I wouldn't be left with something physically. That's why, when I felt I had to get up, I thought it was also deliberate; I got up and I realized ‚Äì nothing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1226">But it gives indications (more and more often, day after day,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 152</p>
<p class="PE"> experience after experience), indications of the extent to which the intervention of this Will (which we call divine Will) through the psychic (or even direct, it depends on the case), to what extent it's... all-powerful. And it exclusively depends on... This Will is always active for perfect Harmony ‚Äì yes, perfect Harmony as we can conceive it. There also, in this conception, there is the knowledge that that too will progress, that once that harmony is manifested, then the work will begin for another perfection, which for the moment eludes us. That, too, knows.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1227">More and more, there's a sort of... not exactly fusion [between the subtle physical and the material physical], but... how should I put it?... For everything to hold together, this way of being of the material consciousness continues (the material, physical consciousness), but in it a permeation takes place (it really is a permeation), which doesn't drive away the other, but... at length, it will probably transform it. It doesn't drive it [the material consciousness] away, but it's there and it dominates ‚Äì at times it doesn't dominate, it's the other one that does; and so, depending on the case... it changes external circumstances (its hard to explain).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1228"><em>It changes external circumstances?</em></p>

But I can see (as I perceive the two at the same time, I can see very clearly) that it's a tremendous work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1232">And it takes away some of the fixity: our physical is not only fixed, it's crumbly, and the subtle physical takes away that crumbly character: wherever it would break, now it bends, you understand?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1233">I asked myself that question, I wondered, ‚ÄúBut how? How is it going

<p class="p-num">Page 153</p>
<p class="PE"> The body [Mother's] has certainly been chosen as a field of experiment for some reason, which must be a reason of plasticity of the substance (I don't know). There may be a reason, but in any case it's a fact that it has been chosen to make the experiment. Because the experiment is under way: it starts with the more subtle, and you can see that it goes... <em>(Mother makes a gesture of progressive descent into Matter)</em>. For months and months it has started with the more subtle, and then, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> slowly and progressively, it has descended into a more material field.

One would have been unable to say, ‚ÄúThis is the subtle physical, and that is the material physical.‚Äù It was... <em>(Mother holds the fingers of her right hand tightly in those of her left hand)</em>, it was surprisingly one within the other.

It's a phenomenon of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1234">In last nights experience, it was everything at the same time: the body felt, acted, it was conscious, it observed, decided ‚Äì everything, just everything at the same time.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1423">It was two or three days ago, it came imperatively like that, in connection with some business. They have gatherings in Auroville, at ‚ÄúAspiration‚Äù; I think it's meditations, or something of the sort, I don't know. One of them came and put my photo; so another rushed to his room and came back with a cross!... And he said, ‚ÄúWell, if you put a photo of Mother, I'll put my cross.‚Äù They told me that story. They told me, because the one who put the cross had come to see me with the others (they come once a week, a few of them, four or five), but I didn't know. He came and sat in front of me.... I found him a rather inquisitorial air (I didn't know anything, you understand), and after they left I asked who he was. Then they told me he is a Catholic, and they told me the

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1424">Afterwards there came a whole series of things. But I must say there's literally an invasion there (at different places in Auroville) because it's not watched over, some plots of land are free, and at the center especially, some people have settled there, and there are constantly people who come and settle without asking for permission. So there was a thought to have a ‚Äúbadge‚Äù for those who are really Aurovilians <em>(Mother shows a specimen of badge)</em>. For a few days already they've been thinking of organizing that: during the first year they will have a sort of identity card, and afterwards, if things are fine at the end of the year, you're given the badge.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1458">It's a very strange thing: as the... Lets see, there are two ways of putting it. One is: as the natural sight and hearing decrease, the others grow.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1462">With certain people or a certain kind of occupation, for instance, my experience is that the... let's call it the ‚Äúnext way,‚Äù dominates: the next way of seeing, the next way of hearing. And then, any intrusion of the old way instantly decreases the perception. Which means that the ordinary sight is as if behind a veil, and then the veil grows thicker. But if the circumstances, the people or the work allow me to go more completely into the new consciousness, the perception grows clearer and clearer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1463">The body has understood that, it has been led to understand: it isn't worried about the decreasing sight or hearing, and it notices, it realizes that the more this way, the ordinary way, fades away, recedes, the more the other one increases ‚Äì provided I make no effort to retain the ordinary way. If I naturally let go, then that's how it is.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 181</p>

Eating is very difficult: it's a mixture of something going on quite easily, without your noticing it, or else a struggle against a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> difficulty. It's only now, because I want to say it, that I observe it and try to express it, otherwise there is no mental activity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1470">So then, Aurovilians must want the Truth <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WHATEVER IT MAY BE</span>.... They call ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù what they want, while they must want the truth whatever it may be.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1473">I put ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù with a capital ‚ÄúT.‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> Because, to tell the truth, that's not the word. It is: ‚ÄúWe want <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE DIVINE</span>.‚Äù But then they instantly start arguing! So it's better to put ‚ÄúTruth.‚Äù</p>

I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DELIBERATELY</span> showing myself to certain people, and I had near me someone, always the same person: the physical Mother.

<p class="PE"> woman: there was nothing; and its color was... a little like Auroville's color [orange], like that, but vibrant, that is, as if... not luminous, but with a sort of luminosity. So then, the Mother wore a large cloak, like a large veil over her whole being, with that same color, and she told me, ‚ÄúSee, I have put it on because I've accepted it ‚Äì to tell you that I've accepted it.‚Äù</p>

<p class="PE"> Yesterday we started a work for Auroville, that is to say, we're basically trying to give people from ‚ÄúAspiration‚Äù an idea, simply, of what Aurovilians want: why they are here and what they want. Because it appears that... in fact they've no idea about it. Each one of them came expecting something, but all that isn't coordinated, it's not clear. So R. asked me to clearly express important points. I thought it would be better to do it with the people so as to know what they themselves want, and to have them make an effort to find out. Otherwise... So we started yesterday <em>(Mother takes out a piece of paper)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1890">Yesterday I asked C.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="50" href="#">1</a>, ‚ÄúBut why does one live in Auroville?‚Äù So he gave me the first paragraph:</p>
<p class="Ps">To be a True Aurovilian</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1891">1. The will to consecrate oneself entirely to the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1892">That's what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HE</span> said. I found it fine. </p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1893">After listening inwardly, I added this:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1894">2. The Aurovilian must not be a slave to his desires.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1895">The idea is this: ‚ÄúWe come to Auroville to escape social and moral rules that are artificially practiced everywhere, but it is not to live in the licentiousness of the satisfaction of every desire: it is to rise above desires in a truer consciousness.‚Äù Something like that.... It appears they quite need this! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> So we should add it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1896">We could draw up a whole program, that would be interesting enough.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1897"><em>Yes, but in the practical order, until people go a little behind appearances and stop living on the surface of themselves, nothing will mean anything!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1898">But all that is precisely what they need to be told!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 224</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1899"><em>So the first necessity is to go deep down into themselves, a little. Because even if you tell them "the Divine," what does it mean to their surface consciousness?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1900">Yes.... For him, this boy, it has a meaning, but for most others...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1901"><em>Yes. it doesn't mean anything.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1902">So we should put: ‚ÄúThe first condition is the inner discovery....‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1903"><em>In the ideal order, the first condition is to need something other than the present world and human conditions.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1905"><em>Then, to reach there, the first condition is to descend deep down in oneself to find out what one  behind all these hereditary, social, cultural appearances ‚Äì what one truly is.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1906">So we'll put <em>(Mother writes):</em> First essential condition...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1912">But then, we should tell them that there <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IS</span> a discovery to be made, because many don't know it at all! <em>(Mother laughs)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1913">In the center, there is a free being, vast and knowing, which awaits our discovery and must become the acting center of our being and our life in Auroville.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 225</p>
<p class="PE"> Then, after that, shall we put this <em>(Mother points to the former first point on the consecration to the Divine)</em>, or something else?... It seems to me that this is more an accomplishment, something that comes at the end.</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1914">We should teach them to free themselves from the idea of personal possession.... You see, everything belongs to the Divine, and the Divine gives you not only a center (the center of your individuality), but also the possibility of the personal use of a number of things; but you must take them all like that, as things <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LENT</span> to you by the Divine. The Divine is eternal, of course, he is <em>everlasting</em>, as they say in English, and at the same time as he creates this individual center, a number of things are there to be used for his work, so those things are <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LENT</span>. That's exactly the point: you hold them in your possession for a time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1915">It's to uproot the sense of personal possession.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1918">The only true way to cure desires is to give oneself to the Divine and accept what He gives you as the only things you need. But that's already very advanced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1919"><em>At the beginning, you said that Aurovilians have come ‚Äúto escape moral conventions, etc., but not to give free rein to licentiousness....‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1920">Yes, that's right <em>(Mother writes):</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-1921">2. One lives in Auroville to be free from moral and social conventions; but that freedom must not be a new slavery to the ego, its desires and ambitions.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2097"><em>Soon afterwards</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2098">I had an experience which I found interesting, because it was the first time. It was yesterday or the day before (I forget), R. was here, just in front of me, kneeling, and I saw her psychic being towering above by this much <em>(gesture about eight inches)</em>, taller. It's the first time. Her physical being was short, and the psychic being was tall, like this. And it was a sexless being: neither man nor woman. So I said to myself (it may be always that way, I don't know, but at that time I noticed it very clearly), I said to myself, ‚ÄúBut the psychic being is the one that will materialize and become the supramental being!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2099">I saw it, it was like that. There were distinctive features, but not very pronounced, and it was clearly a being that was neither male </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 246</p>
<p class="PE"> nor female, that had features of both combined. And it was taller than her, it exceeded her on every side by about this much <em>(gesture extending beyond the physical being by about eight inches)</em>. She was here, and it was like this <em>(gesture)</em>. Its color was... this color that, if it became very material, would be Auroville's color [orange]. It was softer, as if behind a veil, it wasn't absolutely precise, but it was this color. And there was hair, but... it was something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2100">Another time maybe I'll see better.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2101">But I found it very interesting, because that being seemed to tell me, ‚ÄúYou're wondering what the supramental being will be ‚Äì here it is! Here it is, this is it.‚Äù And it was there. It was her psychic being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2102">Then one understands. One understands: the psychic being will materialize... and it gives a continuity to evolution.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2103">This creation gives you a clear impression that nothing is arbitrary, that there is a sort of divine logic behind, which isn't like our human logic, but highly superior to our logic (but it exists), and that logic was fully satisfied when I saw that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2104">It's odd, it was also when R. was here that I had that experience of the supramental light going through within [Mother] without causing any

<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2105">So then, I understood why the mind and the vital were sent away from this body, and the psychic being was left (naturally, it was the psychic being that governed all movements earlier, so it was nothing new, but there were no more difficulties: all the complications coming from the vital and the mind, which add their imprints, their tendencies, it was all gone). So I understood: ‚ÄúAh, that's it, it's this psychic being that is to become the supramental being.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2106">I had never bothered to know what it looked like. But when I saw that, I understood. And I see it, I still see it, I have kept the memory. Its hair almost looked red, strangely (it wasn't like red hair, but it looked like it). And its expression! Such a fine expression, gently ironical... oh, extraordinary, extraordinary!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV1_2-2107">You understand, my eyes were open, it was an almost material vision.</p>

It is against this conception that the atheistic objection is aimed, ‚Äì for atheism in Europe has been a shallow and rather childish reaction against a shallow and childish exoteric religionism and its popular inadequate and crudely dogmatic notions. But when I speak of the Divine Will, I mean something different, ‚Äì something that has descended here into an evolutionary world of Ignorance, standing at the back of things, pressing on the Darkness with its Light, leading things presently towards the best possible in the conditions of a world of Ignorance and leading it eventually towards a descent of a greater power of the Divine, which will be not an omnipotence held back </p>

<p class="PE"> and conditioned by the law of the world as it is, but in full action and therefore bringing the reign of light, peace, harmony, joy, love, beauty and Ananda, for these are the Divine Nature. The Divine Grace is there ready to act at every moment, but it manifests as one grows out of the Law of Ignorance into the Law of Light, and it is meant, not as an arbitrary caprice, however miraculous often its intervention, but as a help in that growth and a Light that leads and eventually delivers. If we take the facts of the world as they are and the facts of spiritual experience as a whole, neither of which can be denied or neglected, then I do not see what other Divine there can be. This Divine may lead us often through darkness, because the darkness is there in us and around us, but it is to the Light he is leading and not to anything else.</p>

That was a very intense experience. Then there only remained this vagueness that is the ‚Äúwhole,‚Äù but it didn't lose its impression of vagueness, that is to say, of something imprecise.

The body still receives vibrations: with some people, when they sit in front of me, suddenly there are pains, things going wrong; but now it knows (naturally it knows it's in pain!), but it doesn't put the blame on others: it puts it on itself, it takes it as an indication of the points that aren't yet exclusively under the divine Influence.

Yet it was with that thick circle that Mother had to work almost daily, and that is what made her difficulty, if not suffocation. With Sujata, Mother agreed to receive in rotation a number of those young and simple elements ‚Äì unfortunately, that new opening will soon be blocked by circumstances: a new serious turning point in Mother's yoga, then other ‚Äúimpossibilities.‚Äù)</p>

<p class="PE"><em>[Answer:]</em> Not sex exactly, but what might be called the masculine and feminine principle. It is a difficult question [whether sex is altered in rebirth]. There are certain lines the reincarnation follows and so far as my experience goes and general experience goes, one follows usually a single line. But the alteration of sex cannot be declared impossible. There may be some who do alternate. The presence of feminine traits in a male does not necessarily indicate a past feminine birth ‚Äì they may come in the general play of forces and their formations. There are besides qualities common to both sexes. Also a fragment of the psychological personality may have been associated with a birth not ones own. One can say of a certain person of the past, ‚Äúthat was not myself, but a fragment of my psychological personality was present in him.‚Äù Rebirth is a complex affair and not so simple in its mechanism as in the popular idea.</p>
