<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Publisher’s Note</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2"><i>Early Cultural Writings</i> consists of essays and other prose writings on literature, education, art and other cultural subjects. Most of them were written between 1890 and 1910, a few between 1910 and 1920. The editors have arranged the material by topic in nine parts and two appendixes. Many of the pieces were published in journals or books during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime. The others are reproduced from his manuscripts. The editors have checked all the texts against the relevant printed or manuscript versions. Simple editorial problems arising from incomplete revision, etc., are indicated by means of the system explained in the Guide to Editorial Notation on the next page. More complex problems are discussed in footnotes or in the Note on the Texts at the end of the volume.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Guide to Editorial Notation</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3">About half the material in this volume was not prepared by Sri Aurobindo for publication. This material has been transcribed from manuscripts that present a variety of textual difficulties. As far as possible the editors have indicated these problems by means of the notation shown below.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 30"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>“Agathon painted the loveliness of Love but not Love himself.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 31"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>“Describe him then you” said Julian and raised his hand for silence.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 32"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Powell lay back a moment with his dark Welsh eyes fixed upon the ceiling and then spoke.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 33"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>“I am told to describe Love” began Powell “yet in order to describe I must first define.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>And how is that possible with a being intangible as the air and inconstant as the moon?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>For Love is as slippery and mutable as Proteus, chameleon-hued, multiform, amorphous, infinite; the transmigrations of a Hindu soul are not more various and elastic; the harmony of his outlines are not blurred by chaos or the weird; rather like poetry and summer he wraps himself in a cool soft robe of velvet air and his feet are kissed by the laughing sea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>But the translucent air which promises to reveal is a cloak far thicker than the gathering dusk.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Thus the Eros of Praxiteles is not Love himself but the soul of the sculptor in one of her phases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Yet though Love has no one form, the idea, the soul of Love, that strange essence which walks for ever in the peopled Shadow-land, he is shackled in a single and uniform shape.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>How then shall I paint the idea of Love?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The Greeks have described a child with a warlike bow of horn and bitter arrows tipped with steel, and modern poets inspired by this rude conception have fabled of the smart which is the herald of Love’s shaft.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>But these ideas however happy in themselves are by no means suitable to Love; for they are without two of his most essential elements, the subtle and the impalpable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The Hindus are more felicitous when they sing of Kama — for poetry</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 5</p>
<p class="PE"> alone can express him — the divine and radiant youth mounted on [an] emerald parrot, and bearing in his right hand a bow of flowers; the arrows too must be of the same soft and voluptuous material — for a preference I would name the shefali, the only blossom which has a soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>For Love’s arrow never pains while in the wound — it is too subtle and flower-like — if a lover is in pain, it is because he loves himself more than Love — and that is the fault of Nature, not of Eros.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="3" href="#">6</a><!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Again Love has been painted as blind; and in this<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="4" href="#">7</a> too the poets of Europe have conceived a lyrical<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="5" href="#">8</a> fiction; for they say that Love looses his shafts and knows not whom they strike, whereas indeed he knows too well.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It is his delight to unite those who should never have so much as met and to blind them to their own misery until the shefali arrow has withered in their hearts; and this he does with eyes open and of deliberate purpose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>So far poets have sinned; but it is a vulgar error to suppose Love garrulous, a bastard child of Momus and Aphrodite; whereas in truth he is the lawful son of Hephaistos; but he has swallowed his father down, and for that reason those lovely lips, the scarlet portals of Passion’s treasury<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="6" href="#">9</a>, do not yield up their store of pearls and rubies — nay dare not so much as open lest Hephaistos escape and in his anger blast the world.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 38"><!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>“Yet your belief is the bastard of Momus rather than the heir of Peitho” rejoined Helen Woodward.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 264"><!--SENT--><a name="s_315"><!-- --></a>In some cases beauty seems to have only one of these elements, for example frankincense and music which seem to possess perfume only, but in reality we shall find that they have each one or both of the other elements.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_317"><!-- --></a>Again there are other cases in which beauty undoubtedly has one only of the three elements: and such are certain scents like myrrh, eucalyptus and others, which possess neither colour nor form, isolated hues such as the green and purple and violet painted on floor and walls by the afternoon sun and architectural designs which have no beauty but the isolated beauty of form.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 265"><!--SENT--><a name="s_318"><!-- --></a>The criticism of ages has shown a fit appreciation of these harmonies by adjudging the highest scale of beauty to those forms which blend the three elements and the lowest to those which boast only of one.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 798"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>I had ridden down by Shelsford thro’ the glittering lustre of an afternoon in March and as I was returning somewhat cold and tired, saw at a distance the pink hat and heavy black curls of Keshav Ganesh and with him Broome Wilson and Prince Paradox.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>As I trotted up Prince Paradox hailed me.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>“Come round and have tea with me” he said “we are speculating at large on the primitive roots and origin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">1</a> of the universe, and I know your love for light subjects.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>“I shall be a delighted listener” I said, and was genuine in the assurance, for I had many a while listened with subtle delight to the beautiful and imaginative talk of Keshav Ganesh.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I rode to the stables and returned to the College and quickly changing my apparel repaired to Chetwynd<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86" href="#">2</a> Court, but found them already drinking tea with the liberality of artists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>“A cup of nectar” I cried “ere the bowl be empty!”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>“It seems that Pegasus is blind” said Wilson “or he would not see the drink of Gods in the brown tincture of tea-leaves and the chased bowls of Hephaestus in a common set of China.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>“If not the drink of Gods” I replied “it is the nectar of poets and women.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>“And that is a more splendid title” put in Prince Paradox.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>“You are right” said Keshav “poets and women are the efflorescence of being and the crowning rapture of creation, and if poets are roses in their delicate texture and have the crimson luxury and the heavy fragrance and the petalled sublimity of a blowing rose, women are moulded of as fine<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="87" href="#">3</a> material but are flowers perpetually in the bud and are only seen in a glint of peeping splendour and not in the consummated outburst of glory, which is only fostered by the living waters of culture and the nurturing warmth of independence.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Broome interposed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>“No more of that” he said “if you escape into a byway, Keshav, you will never be wooed back into the high-road.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>“But what is the high-road?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>I inquired.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>“There is more to be pressed” he answered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Then began an amusing scene, for Broome baited his hook for the argument and kept throwing the line repeatedly, but Keshav was the wariest fish that ever cheated an angler and if he ever appeared to bite, was seen, as the line went flying up, to dart away into some fine thought or voluptuous image.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>At last when we least expected it, he plunged into the argument.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 811"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>“And a spectre it is, or rather a scarecrow;” put in Prince Paradox “for it seems to me neither beautiful as an idea nor sound as a theory but merely the last resource of bad psychologists.”<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Temperament is the basis or substratum of character, and the character built on anything other than temperament is an edifice rooted in the sea-waves which in a moment will foam away into nothing or tumble grovelling under the feet of fresh conquerors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>Indeed it would<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="91" href="#">7</a> be more apt to call temperament the root of character, and the character itself the growing or perfect tree with its hundred branches and myriads of leaves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>And temperament is largely due to race, or, in another phrasing, varies with the blood, and if the blood is quick and fiery the temperament is subtle and sensitive and responds as promptly to social influences and personal culture as a flower to sunlight and rain, and shoots up into multitudinous leaves and branches, but if the blood is slow and lukewarm, the temperament is dull and phlegmatic and will not answer to the most earnest wooing, but grows up stunted and withered in aspect and bald of foliage and miserly of branches and altogether unbeautiful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>On the blood depends the sensitiveness of the nerves to impressions and the quick action of the brains and the heat of the passions, and all that goes to the composition of a character, which if they are absent, leave only the heavy sediment and dregs of human individuality.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Born at Kantalpara on the 27th June 1838, dead at Calcutta on the 8th April 1894, his fifty-six years of laborious life were a parcel of the most splendid epoch in Bengali history; yet among its many noble names, his is the noblest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>His life shows us three faces, his academical career, his official labours and his literary greatness; it will be here my endeavour to give some description of each and all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The first picture we have of his childhood is his mastering the alphabet at a single reading; and this is not only the initial picture but an image and prophecy of the rest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Even thus early men saw in him the three natural possessions of the cultured Bengali, a boundless intellect, a frail constitution and a temper mild to the point of passivity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>And indeed Bankim was not only our greatest; he was also our type and magnified pattern.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>He was the image of all that is most finely characteristic in the Bengali race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>At Midnapur, the home of his childhood, the magnificence of his intellect came so early into view, that his name grew into a proverb.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>“You will soon be another Bankim,” — for a master to say that was the hyperbole of praise, and the best reward of industry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>He ascended the school by leaps and bounds; so abnormal indeed was his swiftness that it put his masters in fear for him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>They grew nervous lest they should spoil by over-instruction the delicate fibre of his originality, and with a wise caution they obstructed his entrance into the highest class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Bankim had always an extraordinary luck.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Just as at school his fine promise was saved by the prudence of its guardians from the altar of High Education, the Moloch to whom we stupidly sacrifice India’s most hopeful sons, so it was saved at Hugly College by his own distaste for hard work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>At Hugly College </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 92</p>
<p class="PE"> quite as much as at Midnapur he had the reputation of an intellectual miracle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>And indeed his ease and quickness in study were hardly human.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Prizes and distinctions cost him no effort in the attaining.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>He won his honours with a magical carelessness and as if by accident while others toiled and failed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But while unconquerably remiss in his duties, he bestowed wonderful pains on his caprices.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>He conceived at this time a passion for Sanskrit and read with great perseverance at a Pandit’s tol.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In a single year he had gone through the Mugdhabodh, Raghuvansa, Bhatti and the Meghaduta.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Advancing at this pace he managed in something under four years to get a sense of mastery in the ancient tongue and a feeling for its literary secrets which gave him immense leverage in his work of creating a new prose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Not that there is the least touch of pedantry in his Bengali style: rather it was he and Madhu Sudan Dutt who broke the tyranny of the Sanskrit tradition: but one feels how immensely his labour was simplified by a fine and original use of his Sanskrit knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>At the age of seventeen, being then a student of five years’ standing, he cut short his attendance at Hugly College.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>He left behind him a striking reputation, to which, except Dwarkanath<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">1</a> Mitra, no student has ever come near.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Yet he had done positively nothing in the way of application or hard work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>As with most geniuses his intellectual habits were irregular.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>His spirit needed larger bounds than a school routine could give it, and refused, as every free mind does, to cripple itself and lose its natural suppleness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It was his constant habit, a habit which grew on him with<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="96" href="#">2</a> the lapse of time, to hide himself in a nook of the College Library and indulge his wandering appetite in all sorts of reading.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>At the eleventh hour and with an examination impending, he would catch up his prescribed books, hurry through them at a canter, win a few prizes, and go back to his lotus-eating.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>I believe this is a not uncommon habit with brilliant young men in all countries and it saves them from the sterilizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">3</a> effects of over-instruction; but it hardly strikes one as a safe policy for slower minds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>At the Presidency College, his next seat of instruction, he shaped his versatile intellect to the study of law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>He had then some project of qualifying as a High Court Pleader, but at the <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> right moment for literature the Calcutta University came into being and Bankim took literary honours instead of legal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The Courts lost a distinguished pleader and India gained a great man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Bankim, however, seems to have had some hankering after Law; for he subsequently snatched time from hard official drudgery and larger literary toil to appear with his usual distinguished success for the B.L.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But his chief pretension to academical originality is perhaps that he was, together with Jodunath Bose, our first B.A., even in this detail leading the way for his countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>His official appointment followed close on the heels of his degree.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>At the age of twenty he was sent as Deputy Magistrate to Jessore.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 864"><!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>I have drawn out in a manner as little perfunctory as I could manage, this skeleton of Bankim’s academical life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>In any account of an eminent Hindu a dry sketch of this sort is a form that must be gone through; for we are a scholastic people and in our life examinations and degrees fill up half the book.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>But examinations and degrees are a minor episode in the history of a mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>An European writer has acutely observed that nothing which is worth knowing can be taught.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>That is a truth which Dr. Bhandarkar, when he can spare time from his Carlyle, might ponder over with profit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Not what a man learns, but what he observes for himself in life and literature is the formative agency in his existence, and the actual shape it will take is much determined by the sort of social air he happens to breathe at that critical moment when the mind is choosing its road.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>All else is mere dead material useless without the breath of a vivifying culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>If examinations and degrees are the skeleton of university life, these are its soul and life-blood, and where they exist poorly or not at all, education, except for the one or two self-sufficing intellects, becomes mere wind and dust.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Among what sort of men did the student Bankim move?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>From what social surroundings did his adolescent personality take its colour?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>These are questions of a nearer interest than the examinations he passed or the degrees he took; and to them I shall give a larger answer.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">II. The Bengal He Lived In</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 867"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The society by which Bankim was formed, was the young Bengal of the fifties, the most extraordinary perhaps that India has yet seen, — a society electric with thought and loaded to the brim with passion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Bengal was at that time the theatre of a great intellectual awakening.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>A sort of miniature Renascence was in process.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>An ardent and imaginative race, long bound down in the fetters of a single tradition, had had suddenly put into its hands<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="98" href="#">1</a> the key to a new world thronged with the beautiful or profound creations of Art and Learning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>From this meeting of a foreign Art and civilisation with a temperament differing from the temperament which created them, there issued, as there usually does issue from such meetings, an original Art and an original civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Originality does not lie in rejecting outside influences but in accepting them as a new mould into which our own individuality may run.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>This is what happened and may yet happen in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The first impulse was gigantic in its proportions and produced men of an almost gigantic originality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Rammohan Ray arose with a new religion in his hand, which was developed on original lines by men almost greater one thinks than he, by Rajnarain Bose and Debendranath Tagore.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The two Dutts, Okhay Kumar and Michael Madhu Sudan, began a new Prose and a new<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">2</a> Poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Vidyasagara, scholar, sage and intellectual dictator, laboured hugely like the Titan he was, to create a new Bengali language and a new Bengali society, while in vast and original learning Rajendra Lal Mitra has not met his match.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Around these arose a class of men who formed a sort of seed-bed for the creative geniuses, men of fine critical ability and appreciative temper, scholarly, accomplished, learned in music and the arts, men in short not only of culture, but of original culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Of these perhaps the most finished patterns were Madhu Sudan’s friends, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="PE"> Gourdas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">3</a> Byshak, and that scholarly patron of letters, Rajah Jyotindra Mohun Tagore.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>At the same time there arose, as in other parts of India, a new social spirit and a new political spirit, but these on a somewhat servilely English model.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Of all its channels the released energies of the Bengali mind ran most violently into the channel of literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>And this was only natural; for although the Bengali has by centuries of Brahmanic training acquired a religious temper, a taste for law and a taste for learning, yet his peculiar sphere is language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Another circumstance must not be forgotten.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Our renascence was marked like its European prototype, though not to so startling an extent, by a thawing of old moral custom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The calm, docile, pious, dutiful Hindu ideal was pushed aside with impatient energy, and the Bengali, released from the iron restraint which had lain like a frost on his warm blood and sensuous feeling, escaped joyously into the open air of an almost Pagan freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The ancient Hindu cherished a profound sense of the nothingness and vanity of life; the young Bengali felt vividly its joy, warmth and sensuousness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>This is usually the moral note of a Renascence, a burning desire for Life, Life in her warm human beauty arrayed gloriously like a bride.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It was the note of the sixteenth century, it is the note of the astonishing return to Greek Paganism, which is now beginning in England and France; and it was in a slighter and less intellectual way the note of the new age in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Everything done by the men of that day and their intellectual children is marked by an unbounded energy and passion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Their reading was enormous and ran often quite out of the usual track.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Madhu Sudan Dutt, besides English, Bengali and Sanskrit, studied Greek, Latin, Italian and French, and wrote the last naturally and with ease.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Toru Dutt, that unhappy and immature genius, who unfortunately wasted herself on a foreign language and perished while yet little more than a girl, had, I have been told, a knowledge of Greek.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>At any rate she could write English with perfect grace and correctness and French with energy and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Her novels gained the ear of the French public and her songs breathed fire into the hearts of Frenchmen in their fearful struggle with Germany.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And as was their reading so was their life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>They were <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> giants and did everything gigantically.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>They read hugely, wrote hugely, thought hugely, and drank hugely.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 868"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Bankim’s student days did not happen among that circle of original geniuses; his time fell between the heroes of the Renascence and the feebler Epigoni of our day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But he had contemporary with him men of extraordinary talent, men like Dinabandhu Mitra and Dwarkanath Mitra, men so to speak of the second tier.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Bankim was the last of the original geniuses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Since then the great impulse towards originality has gone backward like a receding wave.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>After Bankim came the Epigoni, Hemchandra Banerji, Nobin Sen, Robindranath<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="101" href="#">4</a> Tagore, men of surprising talent, nay, of unmistakable genius, but too obviously influenced by Shelley and the English poets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>And last of all came the generation formed in the schools of Keshab Chandra Sen and Kristo Das Pal, with its religious shallowness, its literary sterility and its madness in social reform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Servile imitators of the English, politicians without wisdom and scholars without learning, they have no pretensions to greatness or originality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Before they came the first mighty impulse had spent itself and Bengal lay fallow for a new.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>It rests with the new generation, the generation that will soon be sitting in the high places and judging the land, whether there shall be scope for any new impulse to work itself out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Two years ago it looked as if this mighty awakening would lose itself, as the English sixteenth century lost itself, in Puritanism and middle-class politics.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 869"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>But when Bankim was a student, the traditions of the Hindu college were yet powerful, the Hindu college, that nursery of geniuses, where the brain of the New Age had worked most powerfully and the heart of the New Age had beat with the mightiest vehemence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The men around Bankim were calmer, sedater, more temperate; but they walked in the same ways and followed the same ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>To that life of hard thinking and hard drinking Bankim was drawn not merely, as some were, by the power of youthful imitativeness, but by sympathy of temperament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>He had the novelist’s catholicity of taste and keen sense for life, and the artist’s repugnance to gloom and dreariness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Even when the thoughts turned to old faith, the clear sanity of the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="PE"> man showed itself in his refusal to admit asceticism among the essentials of religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>He never indulged in that habit of frightful and inveterate riot which has killed one or two of our second-rate talents, but it cannot quite be said that he never overstepped the limits or always observed the principle of “nothing in excess,” which is the only sure rule for a man’s conduct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Some would like to see in this sensuous exuberance the secret of his early decay.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>It may be so; but speculation on this subject will remain a solemn farce, until it is taken up in a disinterested spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>At present all our wise disquisitions proceed from unchastened sentiment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Dr. Bhandarkar is a violent social reformer and wants to throw odium upon Hindu society; Mr. Ranade’s hobby is a Conservative Radicalism and the spirit moves him to churn the ocean of statistics in a sense more agreeable to his own turn of mind; a third authority, prejudiced against Western Culture, traces all premature deaths to pleasure and wine-bibbing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Each starts from his own sensations, each builds his web of argument in the spirit of a sophist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>To this Dr. Bhandarkar brings his moral ardour and grave eloquence, Mr. Ranade his trained reason and distinguished talent, the religionist his prejudices and cold precepts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Widely as they differ, they have this in common that they have not for their aim to speak usefully: they are simply trying to find reasons for their own likes and dislikes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Dealing with subjects of scientific interest in a spirit of this sort is only to invite confusion and exclude light.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>We in Bengal with our tendency to the sins of the blood are perhaps more apt than others to call to our aid the gloomy moralities of the Puritan; in censuring Bankim we are secretly fortifying ourselves against ourselves; but in this instance it is a false caution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>The cultured Bengali begins life with a physical temperament already delicate and high-strung.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>He has the literary constitution with its femineity and acute nervousness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Subject this to a cruel strain when it is tenderest and needs the most careful rearing, to the wicked and wantonly cruel strain of instruction through a foreign tongue; put it under the very worst system of training; add enormous academical labour, immense official drudgery in an unhealthy climate and constant mental application; crown all with the <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> nervous expense of thought and fever of composition plus the unfailing exhaustion that comes after; and we need not go to the momentary excesses of a generous blood to find the explanation of broken health and an early decline.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The miracle of it is not that the victims die prematurely but that they live so long.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Perhaps we might begin to enquire into the causes of that phenomenon for a change.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 870"><!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>One thing however is certain that whatever else Bankim lost, he gained from his youthful surroundings much emotional experience and great flexibility of mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>There too he got his initial stimulus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>Like Telang, and perhaps even more than Telang, Bankim was blessed or cursed with an universal talent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Everything he touched, shaped itself to his hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>It would have been easy for him to make disastrous mistakes, to miss his vocation, waste himself in English and at the end to leave no enduring monument of his personality behind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>What saved him?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>It was the initial stimulus and the cultured environment; it was that he lived among men who could distinguish a talent when they saw it and once distinguished were bent on realizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">5</a> it; among men in fact who had some instinct for finding their way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>With a limited creature like man, the power of the environment is immense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>Genius it is true exists independently of environment and by much reading and observation may attain to self-expression but it is environment that makes self-expression easy and natural; that provides sureness, verve, stimulus.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 877"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Whenever a literary man gives proof of a high capacity in action people always talk about it as if a miracle had happened.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The vulgar theory is that worldly abilities are inconsistent with the poetic genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Like most vulgar theories it is a conclusion made at a jump from a few superficial appearances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The inference to be drawn from a sympathetic study of the lives of great thinkers and great writers is that except in certain rare cases versatility is one condition of genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Indeed the literary ability may be said to contain all the others, and the more so when it takes the form of criticism or of any art, such as the novelist’s, which proceeds principally from criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Goethe in Germany, Shakespeare, Fielding and Matthew Arnold in England are notable instances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Even where practical abilities seem wanting, a close study will often reveal their existence rusting in a lumber-room of the man’s mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The poet and the thinker are helpless in the affairs of the world, because they choose to be helpless: they sacrifice the practical impulse in their nature, that they may give full expression to the imaginative or speculative impulse; they choose to burn the candle at one end and [not] at the other, but for all that the candle has two ends and not one.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Bankim, the greatest of novelists, had the versatility developed to its highest expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Scholar, poet, essayist, novelist, philosopher, lawyer, critic, official, philologian and religious innovator, — the whole world seemed to be shut up in his single brain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>At first sight he looks like a bundle of contradictions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>He had a genius for language and a gift for law; he could write good official papers and he could write a matchless prose; he could pass examinations and he could root out an organised tyranny; he could concern himself with the largest problems of metaphysics and with the smallest details of word-formation: he had a feeling for the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 104</p>
<p class="PE"> sensuous facts of life and a feeling for the delicate spiritualities of religion: he could learn grammar and he could write poetry.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 878"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>What shall we say in the presence of this remarkable versatility?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Over-borne by the pomp of it and the show, shall we set it down as an adjunct of intellectual kingliness?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Yes, to have it is an adjunct of intellectual kingliness, but to give expression to it is an intellectual mistake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>To give impartial expression to all your gifts is to miss your vocation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Bankim was never so far led astray as that.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>His province was literature, prose literature, and he knew it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>His lyrics are enchanting, but few; metaphysics he followed at the end of his life and law at the beginning; and he used scholarship and philology, simply as other great writers have used them, to give subtlety of suggestion and richness of word-colour to his literary style.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Even in the province of prose literature, where he might have worked out his versatility to advantage, he preferred to specialise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>He never stepped unpardonably out of his province, but he was occasionally led astray by this or that lure to allow small drains on his fund of energy; and so far as he did so, he sinned against his own soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The one great and continuous drain was the tax put upon him by official drudgery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Under the morbid and wasteful conditions of middle-class life in India genius, when not born in the purple, has put before it, like the fair Rosamund of Norman romance, a choice between two methods of suicide, the Services and the Law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>It must either take the poisoned bowl or the dagger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>And in this limited circle of professions the Educational Service with its system of respites and remissions, and the Executive Service with its indirect rather than direct tax on the pure intellect, present, it may be, the points of least repulsion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But they are none the less a fearful drain because they are, under existing circumstances, necessary.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 879"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>In this versatility Bankim was only a type of the intellectual Hindu.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This gift, at once a blessing and a curse, is the most singular characteristic of those two Hindu races, which have the destinies of the country in their keeping.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is the evidence of our high blood, our patent of nobility among the nations; for </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 105</p>
<p class="PE"> it comes of the varied mental experience of our forefathers, of the nation’s three thousand years of intellectual life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But it is at the same time a rock ahead, of which the Hindu genius has yet to pilot itself clear.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>To find your vocation and keep to it, that is not indeed a showy, but it is a simple and solid rule of life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>We however prefer to give an impartial expression to all our gifts, forgetting that the mind is as mortal and as much subject to wear and tear as any perishable thing, forgetting that specialism is one condition of the highest accomplishment, forgetting that our stock of energy is limited and that what we expend in one direction, we lose in another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We insist on burning the candle at both ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>This spirit appears in our system of public instruction, the most ingeniously complete machine for murder that human stupidity ever invented, and murder not only of a man’s body but of a man’s soul, of that sacred fire of individuality in him which is far holier and more precious than this mere mortal breath.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It appeared too with melancholy effects in the literary fate of Kashinath Telang.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It was one reason why he, a man of such large abilities, the most considerable genius a highly intellectual people has produced, yet left nothing to which the world will return with unfailing delight.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Telang, it is true, worked mainly in English, a language he had learned; and in a language you have learned, you may write graciously, correctly, pleasingly, but you will never attain to the full stature of your genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>But it was a yet more radical mistake that he, whose power was pre-eminently literary, as any eye trained to these things can see that it was, yet allowed it to run in every direction except the very one that nature had marked out for it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Bankim was more fortunate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>He wrote in his own beautiful mother-tongue, his best work was literary and his immense originality would in any case have forced its way out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>But one cannot think without a pang of the many delightful master-pieces he might have brought into his garner, if he had had leisure to work single-heartedly in the field of his richest harvests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The body of work he gave us in nearly forty years of intellectual activity amounts to ten novels, two critical works on religion and some scattered literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Small in quantity, it is pure gold <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> in quality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>And it may be that in no case would he have written much.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 882"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Bankim’s literary activity began for any serious purpose at Khulna, but he had already trifled with poetry in his student days.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>At that time the poet Iswara Chandra Gupta was publishing two papers, the <i>Sangbad Prabhakar</i> and the Sadhuranjan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">1</a>, which Dwarkanath<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="112" href="#">2</a> Mitra and Dinbandhu<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="113" href="#">3</a> Mitra were helping with clever school-boy imitation of Iswara Chandra’s style.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Bankim also entered these fields, but his striking originality at once distinguished him from the mere cleverness of his competitors, and the fine critical taste of Iswara Chandra easily discovered in this obscure student a great and splendid genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Like Madhu Sudan Dutt Bankim began by an ambition to excel in English literature, and he wrote a novel in English called Rajmohan’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="114" href="#">4</a> <i>Wife</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But, again like Madhu Sudan, he at once realised his mistake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The language which a man speaks and which he has never learned, is the language of which he has the nearest sense and in which he expresses himself with the greatest fulness, subtlety and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>He may neglect, he may forget it, but he will always retain for it a hereditary aptitude, and it will always continue for him the language in which he has the safest chance of writing with originality and ease.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>To be original in an acquired tongue is hardly feasible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The mind, conscious of a secret disability with which it ought not to have handicapped itself, instinctively takes refuge in imitation, or else in bathos and the work turned out is ordinarily very mediocre stuff.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It has something unnatural and spurious about it like speaking with a stone in the mouth or walking upon stilts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Bankim and Madhu Sudan, with their overflowing originality, must have very acutely felt the tameness of their English work.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> Khulna and finished at Baruipur, the birthplace of some of his finest work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It was the <i>Durgesh Nandini</i>, a name ever memorable as the first-born child of the New Prose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>At Baruipur he wrote also Kopal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="116" href="#">6</a> <i>Kundala</i> and <i>Mrinalini</i> and worked at the famous <i>Poison-Tree</i>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Since then Bankim has given us some very ripe and exquisite work, <i>Chandrashekhar</i>, <i>Krishna Kanta’s Will</i>, <i>Debi Chaudhurani</i>, Anandmath<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="118" href="#">8</a>,<i> Sitaram</i>, <i>Indira</i> and Kamal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="119" href="#">9</a> <i>Kanta</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Dating from his magistracy at Barhampur<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="120" href="#">10</a> broken health and increasing weakness attended the great novelist to his pyre; but the strong unwearied intellect struggled with and triumphed over the infirmities of the body.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>His last years were years of suffering and pain, but they were also years of considerable fruitfulness and almost unceasing labour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>He had been a sensuous youth and a joyous man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Gifted supremely with the artist’s sense for the warmth and beauty of life, he had turned with a smile from the savage austerities of the ascetic and with a shudder from the dreary creed of the Puritan.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>More and more the philosophic bias made its way into his later novels, until at last the thinker in him proved too strong for the artist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Amid his worst bodily sufferings he was poring over the Bhagavadgita and the Vedas, striving to catch the deeper and sacred sense of those profound writings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>To give that to his countrymen was the strenuous aim of his dying efforts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>A Life of Krishna, a book on the Essence of Religion, a rendering of the Bhagavadgita and a version of the Vedas formed the staple of his literary prospects in his passage to the pyre.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->His place in literature</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 884"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>To assign Bankim’s place in Bengali literature is sufficiently easy: there is no prose-writer, and only one poet who can compete with him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>More difficulties enter into any comparison of him with the best English novelists; yet I think he stands higher than any of them, except one; in certain qualities of each he may fall short, but his sum of qualities is greater; and he has this supreme advantage over them all that he is a more faultless artist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In his life and fortunes, and sometimes even in his character, he bears a striking resemblance to the father of English fiction, Henry Fielding; but the literary work of the two men moves upon different planes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Philosophical culture, and deep feeling for the poetry of life and an unfailing sense of beauty are distinguishing marks of Bankim’s style; they find no place in Fielding’s.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is a marvellous thing that the people who misuse this phrase as an encomium, cannot understand that it conveys an insult.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>They would have us imagine that one of the most perfect and original of novelists is a mere replica of a faulty and incomplete Scotch author!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Scott had many marvellous and some unique gifts, but his defects are at least as striking.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>His style is never quite sure; indeed, except in his inspired moments, he has no style: his Scotch want of humour is always militating against his power of vivid incident; his characters, and chiefly those in whom he should interest us most, are usually very manifest puppets; and they have all this shortcoming, that they have no soul: they may be splendid or striking or bold creations, but they live from outside and not from within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Scott could paint outlines, but he could not fill them in.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Here Bankim excels; speech and action with him are so closely interpenetrated and suffused with a deeper existence that his characters give us the sense of their being real men and women.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Even novelists of genius stop short at the outside: they cannot find their way into the soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Here Fielding fails us; Scott’s women are a mere gallery of wax figures, Rebecca herself being no more than a highly-coloured puppet; even in Thackeray the real women are only three or four.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But the supreme dramatic genius has found out this secret of femineity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Shakespeare had it to any degree, and in our own century Meredith, and among ourselves Bankim.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The social reformer, gazing, of course, through that admirable pair of spectacles given to him by the Calcutta University, can find nothing excellent in Hindu life, except its cheapness, or in Hindu woman, except her subserviency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Beyond this he sees only its narrowness and her ignorance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>But Bankim had the eye of a poet and saw much deeper than this.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>He saw what was beautiful and sweet and gracious in Hindu life, and what was lovely and noble in Hindu woman, her deep heart of emotion, her steadfastness, tenderness and lovableness, in fact, her woman’s soul; and all this we find burning in his pages and made diviner by the touch of a poet and an artist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Our social reformers might learn something from Bankim.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Their zeal at present is too little ruled by discretion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>They are like bad tailors very clever at spoiling the rich stuffs given over to their shaping but quite unable to fit the necessities of the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>They have passed woman through an English crucible and in place of the old type, which, with all its fatal defects, had in it some supreme possibilities, they have turned out a soulless and superficial being fit only for flirtation, match-making and playing on the piano.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>They seem to have a passion for reforming every good thing out of existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>It is about time this miserable bungling should stop.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>I now come to speak of it in the historic sense, of its relations to the Bengali language and potency over the Bengali race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Of this it is not easy to suggest any image without speaking in superlatives.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>I had almost said in one place that he created the language, and if one couples his name with Madhu Sudan Dutt’s, the statement is hardly too daring.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Before their advent the Bengali language, though very sweet and melodious, was an instrument with but one string to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Except the old poet Bharatchandra, no supreme genius had taken it in hand; hence while prose hardly existed except in <i>Baital Pachisi</i> and some other tales about Vikramaditya, Bengali verse had very little to recommend it beyond a certain fatiguing sweetness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Virility, subtlety, scope, these were wanting to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Then came Madhu Sudan and Bankim, and, like Terpander and Orpheus added fresh strings to the lyre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In Madhu Sudan’s hands that nerveless and feminine dialect became the large utterance of the early Gods, a tongue epic and Titanic, a tongue for the storms and whirlwinds to speak in: he caught and studied his diction from the echo and rumour of the sea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>All the stormiest passions of man’s soul he expressed in gigantic language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We seem to hear Milton’s Satan speaking in every line he wrote.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But in Bankim’s hands the Bengali language, before stammering and inarticulate, became a rich, musical and flexible organ vibrating to every human emotion and expressive of every beautiful or noble thought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>I do not mean that there were no labourers in the field before Bankim and Madhu Sudan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The paths of the Gods are always prepared for them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Many daring minds were already at work, but they fell short of their high conception.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Rammohan Ray, the great Vidyasagara, Okhay Kumar Dutt and the Bengali playwrights were all working bravely towards the same consummation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 113</p>
<p class="PE"> Vidyasagara, though he had much in him of the scholar and critic, was nothing of an artist; Okhay Kumar’s audience ran only to the subscribers of a single magazine; and the literary originality of the rest was not equal to their audacity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>None of them could transform and recreate with that sure and easy touch, which reveals the true maker of language.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 889"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Bankim moreover has this splendid distinction, that he more than anyone exalted Bengali from the status of a dialect to the majesty of a language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The immediate effect of English education had been to foster an undiscriminating love of things English and an unwise contempt for things Bengali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Among the rest the Bengali tongue was put by as an instrument hopelessly bad and unsatisfying; even Madhu Sudan in his youth neglected and forgot it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The strivings of Vidyasagara and Okhay Kumar Dutt were the strivings of a few far-sighted and patriotic men in a generation misled by false ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>On that generation Madhu Sudan’s first great poems, Sharmishtha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="127" href="#">1</a> and <i>Tilottama</i>, had a complex effect much of a piece with the sensation created by Marlowe’s <i>Tamburlaine</i> in Elizabethan England or Hugo’s <i>Hernani</i> in nineteenth century France.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>They took men’s imaginations by storm with their splendour, passion and mighty imagery; by creating the Bengali blank verse they freed poetry from the facilities and prettinesses of the old rhymed stanza; by their magnificencies<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="128" href="#">2</a> of style and emotion they brought new elements into Hindu literature, and they gave battle with their strange and fiery coloured music to the classic frigidity of the Sanscritists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="129" href="#">3</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>They first sounded the note of Romanticism which still governs our literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>They revealed too those magnificent possibilities, latent in every Sanscritic<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130" href="#">4</a> language, which only wait for the magic touch of original genius to open out their store; and they set flowing that perennial fountain of gracious and noble poetry which is doing so much to bring beauty and high feeling into our lives and to produce a race of Bengalis braver and better than we.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But at the same time they had to overcome a vast opposition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Lauded with rapturous enthusiasm by the cultured, they were anathematised by the pedants.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>All the Pandits, all the Sanscritists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="131" href="#">5</a>, all the fanatics of classicism, even the great </p>

<p class="PE"> Vidyasagara himself, then the intellectual dictator of Bengal, were startled out of their senses by these magnificent and mighty poems.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a><i>Tilottama</i> was a gauntlet thrown down by the Romantic school to the classical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Romanticism won: it was bound to win: it had on its side youth, fire, enthusiasm, the future, and the poems of an unexampled genius for its battle-cry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a><i>Tilottama</i> had been the <i>casus belli</i>; that marvellous epic, the <i>Meghnad-badh</i>, was the <i>coup de grâce</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>When Vidyasagara<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="132" href="#">6</a> praised the <i>Meghnad-badh</i> as a supreme poem, the day of the Sanscritists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="133" href="#">7</a> was over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>That cabal of Pandits which had shouted against Madhu Sudan, could only murmur weakly against Bankim; the conscience of the nation had passed out of their keeping.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But still the victor’s audience was small and went little beyond the class that followed him into battle, the geniuses, the literary men, the women<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="134" href="#">8</a>, the cultured zamindars and those men of the stamp of Rajah Jyotindra Mohan Tagore, men of an extraordinary and original culture, who were then so common in Bengal, but are now almost obsolete.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The great poet died with a limited audience and before the full consummation of his fame.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>There is, indeed, a curious contrast between these two builders of the Bengali language, so alike in their mission, but in their fortunes so dissimilar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Both were equipped with enormous stores of reading, both were geniuses of a vast originality, both had creative power, a fine sense for beauty, and a gift for emotion and pathos: both made the same false start.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>But here all likeness between them stops.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>One was the king of prose, the other the king of poetry; and their lives were of a piece with their writings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Madhu Sudan’s is full of sound and passion, violence of heart, extravagance, intemperance, self-will, a life passing through grief, bitterness and anguish to a mournful and untimely doom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>As we read the passage of that Titanic personality over a world too small for it, we seem to be listening again to the thunder-scene in <i>Lear</i>, or to some tragic piece out of Thucydides or Gibbon narrating the fall of majestic nations or the ruin of mighty kings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>No sensitive man can read it without being shaken to the very heart.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> Madhu Sudan’s evil star followed him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Though a great poet among the greatest, he is read nowhere outside Bengal and the Panjab<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="135" href="#">9</a>; and his name is not heard even in Bombay and Madras, provinces of his own native land.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>How different was it with Bankim, the genius of prose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>His nature, with plenty of strength in it, was yet mild, calm and equable, clear and joyous, but not intemperate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Fortune’s favourite to whom every door opened without keys, his life had in it that sedate maturity and august quiet, which, according to Epicurus, is the true attitude of the Gods, and which the Gods only give to those mortals, who, like themselves, have seen life steadily and seen it whole.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>And if his last years were stained with suffering, yet he died in the fruition of his greatness, amid the mourning of a nation which he had done much to create and whose imagination he had filled with so many beautiful thoughts and so many tender, passionate or glorious images.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 891"><!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Bankim’s influence has been far-reaching and every day enlarges its bounds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>What is its result?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Perhaps it may very roughly be summed up thus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>When a Mahratta or Gujerati has anything important to say, he says it in English; when a Bengali, he says it in Bengali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>That is, I think, the fact which is most full of meaning for us in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>It means besides other things less germane to literature, that, except in politics and journalism which is the handmaid of politics, English is being steadily driven out of the field.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Soon it will only remain to weed it out of our conversation; and even to that wheel I am told that Babu Kali Prasunna Ghose has set his shoulder.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>However that may be, the works of this distinguished prose-writer are a remarkable proof of what I have just been saying.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Not long ago anyone moving in that province of the mind which Babu Kali Prasunna has annexed, would have held it beneath the dignity of his subject to write in any medium but English.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Work like Babu Kali Prasunna’s marks an important stage in the great revolution of sentiment which our literary class has set going, the revolution of sentiment which promises to make the Bengalis a nation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Relation of Gray to the poetry of his times</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 903"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The poetry of Gray marks the transition from the eighteenth-century or Augustan style of poetry to the nineteenth-century style; i.e. to say<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="141" href="#">1</a> almost all the tendencies of poetry between the death of Pope and the production of the Lyrical Ballads in 1798 are to be found in Gray’s writings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Of the other poets of the time, Johnson and Goldsmith mark the last development of the Augustan style, while Collins, Blake, Cowper, Burns, Chatterton each embody in their poetry the beginnings of one or more tendencies which afterwards found their full expression in the nineteenth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Gray alone seems to include in himself along with many characteristics of the conservative school of Johnson and Goldsmith all the revolutionary tendencies, not one or many but all, of the later poets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>His earliest poem, the Ode on Spring, has many of the characteristics of Pope and Dryden; one of his latest, the Ode on Vicissitude, has many of the characteristics of Wordsworth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>He is therefore the typical poet of his age, which, as regards poetry, was an age of transition.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->What is meant by the Augustan or eighteenth-century style?
<a name="s_8"><!-- --></a><!--/SENT--></h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 904"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The poetry of the eighteenth century differs entirely from that of another period in English literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It differs alike in subject-matter, in spirit and in form.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Many modern critics have denied the name of poetry to it altogether.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Matthew Arnold calls Pope and Dryden classics not of poetry, but of prose, he says that they are great in the regions of half poetry; other critics while hesitating to go so far, say in substance much the same thing; Gosse, for instance, calls their poetry the poetry of English rhetoric, which exactly amounts to Matthew Arnold’s description of it as </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 126</p>
<p class="PE"> half poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Its own admirers give it the name of classic poetry, that is to say a poetry in which imagination and feeling are subordinated to correctness and elegance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 905"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Poetry as generally understood, the poetry of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, may be defined as a deeper and more imaginative perception of life and nature expressed in the language and rhythm of restrained emotion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>In other words its subject-matter is an interpretation of life and nature which goes deeper into the truth of things than ordinary men can do, what has been called a poetic criticism of life; its spirit is one of imagination and feeling, it is not intellectual but imaginative, not rational but emotional; and its form is a language impassioned and imaginative but restrained by a desire for perfect beauty of expression; and a rhythm generally taking the form of metre, which naturally suits the expression of deep feeling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It differs from rhetoric in this that rhetoric expresses feeling which is not deep and not quite sincere, and tries to strike and influence the reader instead of being satisfied with expressing itself and for that purpose relies mainly on tricks of language such as antithesis, epigram etc.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Rhetoric tries to excite admiration and appeals to the intellect; poetry is content with adequate self-expression and appeals to the heart.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 906"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Eighteenth-century poetry differs from ordinary poetry, in subject-matter, in spirit and in form.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Spirit</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 907"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The spirit of ordinary poetry is one of imagination and feeling, that is to say imaginative and emotional; that of eighteenth-century poetry is one of commonsense and reason, that is to say intellectual and rational.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Pope and Johnson are the two chief critics of the school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Pope expressly lays it down in his Essay on Criticism that sense and wit are the bases of all true poetry and Johnson is continually appealing to them as criterions, especially in his life of Gray, where he objects to what he considers the excess of imagery, the incredibility of his subjects, the use of imaginative mythological language and the occasional absence of a didactic purpose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>In their opinion nothing should </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 127</p>
<p class="PE"> be admitted in poetry which is not consistent with sense and wit, that is to say which is not intellectual and rational.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Accordingly we find no striking imagery and no passion in eighteenth-century poetry; the poets as a rule avoid subjects in which emotion is required and when they do try to deal with the passions and feelings, they fail, their expression of these is rhetorical and not poetic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>This is the reason why the drama in the eighteenth century is such an utter failure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Subject-matter</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 908"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The difference in subject-matter is manifold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>In the first place, instead of dealing with the whole of life and nature, they limit themselves to a very narrow part of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>This limitation is partly due to the restriction of poetry to sense and wit and partly to the nature of the audience the poets addressed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It was a period in which literature depended mainly on the patronage of the aristocracy, and it was therefore for the English aristocracy of the time that the poets wrote.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>They were therefore bound to limit themselves to such subject-matter as might suit the tastes of their patrons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>These two considerations led to three very important limitations of subject-matter.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 909"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>1st. The exclusion of the supernatural from poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The temper of the times was rationalistic and sceptical and to the cultured aristocracy of the times Shakespeare’s ghosts and fairies and Milton’s gods and angels would have seemed absurdities; it resulted also from the idea of commonsense as the cardinal rule of poetry, that nothing incredible should be admitted unless it was treated humorously, like the sylphs and gnomes in Pope’s Rape of the Lock or the beasts in the fables of Gay and Swift.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Poetry however seems naturally to demand the element of the supernatural and the only way to admit the supernatural without offending against reason was by Personification.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>We therefore find a tendency to create a sort of makeshift mythology by personifying the qualities of the mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Otherwise the supernatural practically disappears from English poetry for a whole century.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 910"><!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>2d. The exclusion of rural life and restriction to the life of the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 128</p>
<p class="PE"> town and of good society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The aristocracy of the time took no interest in anything but the pleasures, occupations and mental pursuits of the town and it is accordingly only with this part of life that eighteenth-century poetry deals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The country is only treated as a subject of ridicule as in Gay’s Shepherd’s Week or of purely conventional description as in Pope’s Pastorals and Windsor Forest.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="142" href="#">2</a><!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 911"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>3d. As a natural result of this, the exclusion of external Nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The sense of natural beauty is quite absent from eighteenth-century poetry and we do not have even so much as the sense of the picturesque except in subjects such as landscape gardening where art could modify nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Whenever the poets try to write of natural scenery or natural objects, they fail; their descriptions are either conventional and do not recall the object at all or only describe it in a surface manner recalling just so much as may be perceived by a casual glance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Of sympathy with Nature or close observation of it, there is hardly a single instance in English poetry between Dryden and Thomson.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 912"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>4th. The exclusion of human emotion, i.e. to say<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="143" href="#">3</a> poetry was not only limited to the workings of the human mind and human nature but to cultured society and to the town, and not only to this but to the intellect and weaknesses of men purely; the deeper feelings of the heart are not touched or only touched in an inadequate manner; and it is a characteristic fact that the passion of love which is the most common subject of English poetry, is generally left alone by these poets or if handled, handled in a most unreal and rhetorical manner.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 913"><!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>It followed from the exclusion of so much subject-matter that the forms of poetry which demanded this subject-matter almost disappeared.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Lyrical poetry and the drama, both of which demand passion, feeling and fancy, epic poetry, which requires a grasp of entire human and external nature, a wide view of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 129</p>
<p class="PE"> life and some element of the supernature, and serious narrative poetry are very little represented in the age of Pope and then only by second-rate productions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The poetry of the age is mainly didactic, i.e. its subjects are literary criticism, ethics, science or theology or humorous, i.e. consists of satire, mock-epic, humorous narrative and light society verse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>All these are subjects which are really outside the scope of poetry strictly so called, as they give no room for imagination and emotion, the cardinal elements of poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The subjects and the way they are treated, making allowance for the difference involved by the use of metre and especially the heroic metre which necessitates a very condensed expression of thought, is not very different from that of the prose periodicals of the time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The poetry of the age taken in the mass gives one the impression of a great social journal in verse, somewhat more brilliant and varied than the Tatler and Spectator but identical in spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Form</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 914"><!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Lastly the poetry of the eighteenth century differs widely in form, i.e. in language and metre, from that of preceding and subsequent poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>This difference proceeds from a revolt against the poetical language of the seventeenth century, just as the language of Wordsworth and Keats is a revolt against that of the eighteenth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The Elizabethan poets aimed at a poetry which should be romantic, sensuous and imaginative; romantic, that is to say, full of the strange and wonderful, sensuous, that is to say, expressing the perceptions of the senses and especially the sense of the beautiful in vivid and glowing colours, and imaginative in the sense of being full of splendid and original imagery, and especially of striking phrases and vivid metaphors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>In the later Elizabethans and even many of the earlier all this was carried to great excess; the love of the strange and wonderful was carried into unnaturalness and distortion, sensuousness became lost in exaggeration and poetry became a sort of hunt for metaphors, metaphors used not as aids to the imagination, but for their own sake, and the more absurd and violent, the better.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Waller and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 130</p>
<p class="PE"> Dryden first and Pope to a much greater extent revolted against this style of forced ingenuity and proclaimed a new kind of poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>They gave to Elizabethan language the name of false wit and Pope announced the objects of the new school in an often quoted couplet</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 915">True wit is nature to advantage dressed</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 916">What oft was thought, but ne’er so well expressed.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 917"><!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>This couplet gives the three main principles of eighteenth-century style out of which all its distinctive characteristics rise.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 918"><!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>(1) The poets were to write only of what oft was thought; they were to avoid the Elizabethan romantic tendency to search after the strange and wonderful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>But these poets went much farther.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Not only all that was peculiar or eccentric but all that was original, individual or unusual was avoided as offensive to reason and commonsense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>There are no ideas in Augustan poetry which are not perfectly obvious and common, nothing which might not occur to an average educated man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>This was fatal to poetry which to be poetry at all must be unusual; unusually lofty, unusually beautiful or unusually impassioned, and which dries up in an atmosphere of commonsense and commonplace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Augustan poetry has neither feeling for greatness nor for beauty nor for passion and it is therefore not without justice that it is described as at best a half poetry or a poetry of rhetoric.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 919"><!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>But the obvious and commonplace will not be read, unless it is made to look new and interesting by brilliant language.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 920"><!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>(2) The second principle is that while the obvious and commonplace should be the staple of poetry, it should be expressed in new and brilliant language, and this should be done by means of true wit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>That is to say, while false ingenuity should be avoided, true ingenuity should be the rule of poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>Accordingly we find that striking poetical expressions are singularly absent, the imagery is cold, obvious and conventional and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="144" href="#">4</a> their place is taken by brilliant cleverness and rhetoric.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>In order to conceal the barrenness of subject-matter every line is made an antithesis, an epigram or some other rhetorical turn of language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>The Augustan poets did not realise that wit, whether false or true, has </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 131</p>
<p class="PE"> nothing to do with poetry and so they fell from one extreme to the other; poetry with them became even more an exercise for mere ingenuity than with the Elizabethans, in a way less open to ridicule but more barren and prosaic<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="145" href="#">5</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 921"><!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>(3) The eighteenth century was not contented with nature, it wanted nature to be dressed and dressed to advantage.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_80"><!-- --></a>Poetical harmony depends upon two things, the choice of the metre and the combination of all the various cadences possible within the limits of the metre chosen.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 132</p>
<p class="PE"> a particular stanza or a couplet form or blank verse just as he thinks most suitable to his subject; but the pauses and accents in the lines of the stanza or successive verses may be arranged many different ways, the disposition of long and short syllables and the combination of assonances and alliterations are almost infinite in their variety and great poets always vary one line from another so that not only the language but the sound of the verse, or as it is technically called the movement may suggest the exact emotion intended.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_82"><!-- --></a>This variation of cadences is a matter not for rules, but for individual genius to work out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>But the Augustan poets in their passion for regularity determined to subject even this to rules.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>They chose as their favourite and almost only form of verse, the couplet and especially the heroic couplet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_85"><!-- --></a>All ambitious poetical work of Pope’s school is in the heroic couplet; only in light verse do they try any other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_86"><!-- --></a>The part of their poetry in lyrical metres or in stanzas is insignificant in quantity and almost worthless in quality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_87"><!-- --></a>Having confined themselves to the heroic couplet, they tried to make even this as formal and monotonous as possible; they put a pause regularly at the end of the first line and a full stop or colon at the end of the second; they place the accent almost invariably on every second syllable; they employ assonance without the slightest subtlety and, though without some skill in the disposition of long and short syllables good metre itself is impossible, yet they only use it in the most elementary manner.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 927"><!--SENT--><a name="s_92"><!-- --></a>The main characteristics of eighteenth-century poetry may therefore be summed up as follows; — a rational and intellectual rather than imaginative and emotional spirit; a restriction to town society and town life, and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="148" href="#">8</a> inability to deal with rural life, with Nature, with passion or with the supernatural; a tendency to replace the supernatural by personification; an almost exclusive preference for didactic, satirical and humorous poetry; a dislike of originality and prevalence of merely obvious ideas and sentiments; an excess of rhetorical artifice in style; a monotonous, rhetorical and conventional style; a restricted and cut-and-dried metre and an exclusion of all poetic influences and interests except the Latin writers and contemporary and French thought and literature.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Sketch of the Progress of Poetry from Thomson to Wordsworth</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 933"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The Age of transition from the poetry of Pope to that of Wordsworth begins strictly speaking with Thomson.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>This transition was not an orderly and consistent development, but consisted of different groups of poets or sometimes even single poets each of whom made a departure in some particular direction which was not followed up by his or their successors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The poetry of the time has the appearance of a number of loose and disconnected threads abruptly broken off in the middle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It was only in the period from 1798 to 1830 that these threads were gathered together and a definite, consistent tendency imparted to poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It was an age of tentatives and for the most part of failures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile the main current of verse up till 1798 followed the direction given it by Pope only slightly modified by the greater and more original writers.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 934"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>These different groups of writers may be thus divided.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>(1) The school of natural description and elegiac moralising, consisting of Thomson, Dyer, Green, Young and other inferior writers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>(2) The school of Miltonic Hellenists, begun by Warton and consisting besides of Gray, Collins, Akenside and a number of followers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>(3) The school of Johnson, Goldsmith and Churchill, who continued the eighteenth-century style tho’ some of them tried to infuse it with emotion, directness and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="150" href="#">1</a> greater simplicity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>To this school belong the minor writers who formed the main current of verse during the time; of whom Erasmus Darwin and Gifford are the only notable ones.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>(4) The school of country life and the simpler feelings, consisting of Cowper and Crabbe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>(5) The school of romantic poets and restorers of mediaevalism, consisting of Chatterton, Macpherson and Percy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>(6) The Scotch lyric poets of whom Ferguson and Burns are the head.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>(7) William Blake standing by himself as a romantic, mystical and lyric poet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Besides these there are two writers who cannot </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 135</p>
<p class="PE"> be classed, Smart and Beattie.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Last come the first nineteenth-century poets, who published their earliest work in 1798 – 1800, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, Landor and Campbell.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->School of Natural Description</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 935"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The first to break away from Pope were Thomson and Dyer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The original departures made by their school were as follows.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>(1) In subject-matter an almost exclusive devotion of their poetry to the description of natural objects and natural scenery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>In dealing with human emotion or human life they are generally even more incapable than the Pope school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>There is beside a tendency to force poetry to the service of the most unpoetical subjects, Armstrong writing in verse of the Art of Medicine, Dyer of Agriculture and Thomson of jail reform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>On the other hand Satire is less practised or even abandoned.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>(2) In language, the discarding of the idea of wit as the basis of poetry; there is no straining for wit and cleverness, but its place is taken by a pseudo-Miltonic eloquence or an attempt at Miltonic imaginativeness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The influence of Milton is paramount in these writers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>(3) In metre an almost entire abandonment of the heroic couplet and the return to old metres, especially blank verse, the Spenserian stanza and the octosyllabic couplet as used by the later Elizabethans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The main influences of this school on future poetry are (1st) the habit of describing Nature for its own sake (2) the Thomsonian form of blank verse which was afterwards adopted by Cowper and Wordsworth and improved by Shelley (3) the use of the Spenserian stanza in narrative poetry (4) the sense for antiquity and for the picturesque as regards ruins (5) the habit of moralising on subjects of general human interest as opposed to those which concern towns and highly civilized society only.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 136</p>
<p class="PE"> The Thomsonian school however broke off suddenly about the middle of the century and was replaced by the school of Gray.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 937"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>An<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="151" href="#">2</a> attempt is made to reintroduce emotion and a more general appeal to all humanity, in the form of elegiac moralizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="152" href="#">3</a> on the subjects of death and decay, as shown in Dyer’s Ruins of Rome and Young’s Night Thoughts.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->School of Gray</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 938"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>There are considerable differences between Gray, Collins and Akenside, who are the chief representatives of the school, but they all resemble each other in certain main tendencies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The general aim of all seems to have been to return to the Miltonic style of writing while preserving the regularity and correctness of the eighteenth-century style.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>They attempted in other words to substitute the true classical style of writing for the pseudoclassical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>By classical poetry is meant verse which with entire correctness and perfection of form, i.e. of metre and language and a careful observance of restraint, i.e.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="153" href="#">4</a> to say avoidance of that extravagance and excess which injure the work of Shakespeare and the Elizabethans, unites a high imagination and deep emotion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>This is the character of Milton’s poetry, which is based upon Greek and Latin models.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Pope and his school aimed at correctness and restraint without high imagination and deep emotion; their poetry is therefore not really classical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Gray, Collins and Akenside endeavoured by study of Milton and the Greek writers to recover the true classical style.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>They were however all greatly hampered by the traditions of eighteenth-century poetry and none of them quite succeeded.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 939"><!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Besides this similarity in general aim, there are several particular resemblances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>1st in metre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>They all avoided the heroic couplet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Collins’ Persian Eclogues, the work of his youth, and a few of Gray’s fragments are in this metre, but in their mature and accomplished work it is not represented.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Akenside wrote either in blank verse or in lyrical metres.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Secondly Gray and Collins are the restorers of the English lyric; since the reign of Charles II no one had written any even decently good lyrics, if a few of Gay’s and Prior’s are excepted, until this school appeared.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The only form of lyric however which the three writers tried were Odes, which is the most stately and the least lyrical of lyrical forms; i.e. the true lyrical stanza is always short and simple so </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 137</p>
<p class="PE"> as to express particular emotion freely and naturally; the stanza of an Ode is long and elaborate and expresses properly high and broad, not intense emotion<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="154" href="#">5</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>This restriction to the statelier lyrical forms partly results from the attempt at classical dignity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But the Augustan tradition of smooth and regular verse has also hampered the writers; the cadences are not managed with sufficient subtlety and the infinitely varied and flexible verse of Shakespeare and Milton has remained beyond their reach.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Their verse at its best is on the second plane, not on the first; it shows however a great advance in freedom and variety on that of the Augustans.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 940"><!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>2d in language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The aim of all three is at an elevated style of language, a diction more or less Miltonic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Here again none of them are successful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Akenside’s elevation is mainly rhetorical, rarely, at his best, as in the Hymn to the Naiads, it is poetical; there he almost catches something of the true Miltonic tone; Gray’s is marked by nobleness, strength, much real sublimity, but he is often betrayed into rhetoric tho’ even then more vigorous than Akenside’s and the Augustan love of epigram and antithesis often spoil his work; Collins’ elevation tho’ free from these faults is usually wanting in power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>There is to some extent in Collins and still more in Gray a tendency to what the eighteenth century thought noble language, to the avoidance of simple and common words and phrases as below the dignity of poetry.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 941"><!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>On<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="155" href="#">6</a> the other hand their language is mainly imaginative and not drily intellectual like Augustan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="156" href="#">7</a> language.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 942"><!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>3d in subject-matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It was in this that there was the farthest departure from the eighteenth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>All the poets have a tendency to dwell on rural life and rural scenes; all turn away from town life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Both Gray and Collins, so far as they deal with Nature, deal with it in a really poetical manner, but unlike the Thomsonian school, they have not described Nature for the sake of describing it but only in connection with the thoughts or feelings suggested by it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The one exception to this is Collins’ </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="PE"> Ode to Evening.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>There is also an attempt to reintroduce the supernatural into poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>This is partly done by carrying the eighteenth-century habit of personification to an almost ridiculous extreme, but more successfully by dwelling like Milton on the images of Greek mythology, as in the Hymn to the Naiads, or Gray’s earlier poems, especially the Progress of Poesy; also by dwelling on the ideas of the Celtic romantic fancy, such as ghosts, fairies, spirits as in Gray’s Bard and Collins’ Ode or of Norwegian mythology as in Gray’s translations from the Norse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>This impulse towards the supernatural is extremely marked in Gray and finds its way even into his humorous poems; and tho’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="157" href="#">8</a> less prominent in Collins, it was sufficient to offend Johnson, the chief critic of the Pope school, who especially animadverts on it in his life of Collins and his remarks on Gray’s sister Odes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>Again they tried to deal with human emotion but there also they were hampered by the Augustan tradition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>They deal with it rather in an abstract than a direct manner; Collins’ Ode on the Passions is the main instance of this abstract handling of emotion which is peculiar to the school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>In the same spirit they dealt with high and general feelings, especially the love of Liberty, which inspires Collins’ Ode to Liberty, Gray’s Bard and Progress of Poesy, and much of Akenside’s writing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>It is noticeable that Collins was a republican, Akenside had republican sympathies and Gray was a pronounced Whig.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>Over the personal emotions Collins and Akenside had no mastery, and Gray only shows it occasionally as in the Elegy and then only over the most general of all of them, the love of life and the melancholy feelings attending death.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 943"><!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>(4) In spirit, the school departed from the critical, didactic and satiric tendency of eighteenth-century poetry; so far as their poetry teaches or criticises it is with some exceptions in the indirect, incidental and emotional manner proper to poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>Even Akenside who wrote on a philosophical theme aimed at teaching poetically, tho’ he did not succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>Their poetry is inspired not by intellect and reason, but by imagination and feeling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>On the other hand it must be noticed that their ideas and sentiments are always obvious and on the surface like those of the Pope school and the feeling that inspires their poetry, tho’ not false, is not </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="PE"> very deep; Collins and Akenside are extremely cold compared with poets of other periods and Gray is rather enthusiastic or at his best sublime than impassioned.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 944"><!--SENT--><a name="s_73"><!-- --></a>It<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="158" href="#">9</a> was perhaps partly as a result of this that none of these poets was able to write much or to write long poems; Akenside’s Pleasures of Imagination is the only exception and that is a failure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 945"><!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>(5) It was in the influences which governed their poetry that this school departed most radically from Pope.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>They rejected French influence altogether and were little influenced by the inferior Latin poets; they were above all things Hellenists, lovers and followers of Greek literature; the English poet who influenced them most was Milton whom Johnson considers to be rough in his verse and language; Gray even declared the diction of Shakespeare to be the true poetic diction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>Besides this they opened new fields of interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_77"><!-- --></a>Collins took an interest [in] late mediaeval history and literature and Gray was the first Englishman of eminence who studied the Norse language or interested himself in Welsh literature or was a competent and appreciative critic of Gothic architecture.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 946"><!--SENT--><a name="s_78"><!-- --></a>The Thomsonian school had a little but only a little influence on that of Gray.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_79"><!-- --></a>The Elegy carries to its highest point of perfection the vein of elegiac moralising started by Young and Dyer, Collins’ Ode to Evening is a study of Nature as faithful but more sympathetic and imaginative than Thomson’s descriptions; and his Ode on Popular Superstitions<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="159" href="#">10</a> recalls several passages in the Seasons; but this is practically all.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 947"><!--SENT--><a name="s_80"><!-- --></a>The influences of Gray’s school on future poetry consist mainly in (1) the first attempt to handle Nature in a new poetic fashion afterwards perfected by Wordsworth, (2) the reintroduction of the supernatural influencing all subsequent writers but mainly Coleridge, Shelley and Keats, (3) the introduction of Hellenism into poetry, carried out by Keats and Shelley and (4) the restoration of the lyric and especially the Ode form, which became a favourite one in the early nineteenth century and of the general subjects suited to the Ode form.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"> Later Augustan School<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 948"><!--SENT--><a name="s_82"><!-- --></a>The Gray school exhausted itself almost as quickly as the Thomsonian school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>It was followed by a reaction in favour of the eighteenth-century ideal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>This movement had been already anticipated by Johnson who wrote contemporaneously with Gray and even with Thomson.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_85"><!-- --></a>It was now taken up by Goldsmith, carried on by Churchill and culminated in Erasmus Darwin.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 949"><!--SENT--><a name="s_86"><!-- --></a>Johnson and Goldsmith returned to the ideals of Pope, they violently opposed and disparaged Gray, they kept to the use of the heroic couplet and conventional language, to the narrowness of culture and to the exclusion of all that does not square with or proceed from the reason and intellect; their characteristics are broadly the same as the Pope school’s, but there is a difference which shows that the dryness of this school could no longer satisfy the mind.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_88"><!-- --></a>Goldsmith carried this departure in tone from Pope yet farther; he wrote what were professedly didactic poems, but instead of teaching by satirical portraits [and] epigrammatic maxims, he tried to do it by touching the feelings and drawing portraits full of humour rather than wit, of natural truth and pathos rather than cleverness and eloquence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_89"><!-- --></a>While not touching subjects of general appeal like Johnson and Gray, he goes more widely afield than Pope, dealing with foreign countries in the Traveller, with the rural life of an Irish village in the Deserted Village.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_92"><!-- --></a>Lastly Erasmus Darwin took the exact model of Pope’s style, not only the metre and language but the very construction and balance of his sentences and reduced this and the didactic spirit to absurdity by trying to invest with poetical pomp of style and imagery a treatise on botany.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Originality in National Literatures</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 984"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>It is a singular and as yet unexplained phenomenon in the psychology of mankind that out of so many magnificent civilisations, so many powerful, cultured and vigorous nations and empires whose names and deeds crowd the pages of history, only a select few have been able to develop a thoroughly original and self-revealing literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Still fewer have succeeded in maintaining these characteristics from beginning to end of their literary development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>There have been instances in which a nation at some period of especial energy and stress of life has for a moment arrived at a perfect self-expression, but with the effort the literary originality of the race seems to exhaust itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We have the picture of an age, not the spiritual and mental history of a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Such a period of partial self-revelation we find in the flowering of Italian literature; in the Divine Comedy, the Decameron, the works of Petrarch, Machiavelli, Cellini, Castiglione, mediaeval Italy lives before our eyes for all time; but the rest of Italian prose and poetry is mere literature and nothing more.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Again when we have seen the romantic spirit of Spain, its pride, punctilious sense of honour, courage, cruelty, intrigue, passion and the humour and pathos of its decline mirrored in the work of Calderon and Cervantes we seem to have exhausted all that need interest the student of humanity in Spanish literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Similar instances offer themselves in the Sagas of the Scandinavian peoples and Germany’s Nibelungenlied, in the extraordinary picture of Mahomedan civilisation of which the Thousand and One Nights are the setting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>On the other hand there are literatures of high quality and world-wide interest which are yet almost purely derivative in their character and hardly succeed in rendering the national spirit to us at all, so overloaded are they with foreign material, with things learned rather than experienced; such are the American literature, the modern German literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Instances there </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 147</p>
<p class="PE"> are again of the nation freeing itself from foreign domination in one or two kinds of writing which partially reflect its inner mind and life, while the rest of its literature remains derivative and secondhand in its every fibre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We get to the heart of Roman life and character in Roman Satires, the annalistic histories of Livy and Tacitus, the Letters of Cicero or Pliny, but in the more splendid and ambitious portions of Latin literature we get only the half Greek dress in which the Roman mind learned to disguise itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Let us suppose that all historical documents, archives, records were destroyed or disappeared in the process of Time and the catastrophes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="167" href="#">1</a> of civilisation, and only the pure literature survived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Of how many nations should we have the very life, heart and mind, the whole picture of its life and civilisation and the story<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="168" href="#">2</a> of its development adequately revealed in its best writing?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Three European nations would survive immortally before the eyes of posterity, the ancient Greeks, the modern English and French, and two Asiatic nations, the Chinese and the Hindus, — no others.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 985"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Of all these the Hindus have revealed themselves the most perfectly, continuously and on the most colossal scale, precisely because they have been the most indomitably original in the form and matter of their literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Vedas, Upanishads and Puranas are unique in their kind; the great Epics in their form and type of art stand apart in the epic literature of the world, the old Sanscrit drama has its affinities with a dramatic species which developed itself in Europe more than a thousand years later, and the literary epic follows laws of form and canons of art which are purely indigenous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>And this immense body of firstrate work has left us so intimate and complete a revelation of national life and history, that the absence of pure historical writings becomes a subject of merely conventional regret.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The same intense originality and depth of self-expression are continued after the decline of the classical language in the national literatures of Maharashtra, Bengal and the Hindi-speaking North.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>And since to all quality there must be a corresponding defect, they not only gifted this<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="174" href="#">3</a> genius with rich powers and a remarkable temperament but drew round it the necessary line of limitations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>They then sought for a suitable age, nation and environment which should most harmonise with, foster and lend itself to his peculiar powers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>This they found in the splendid and luxurious city of Ujjaini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="175" href="#">4</a>, the capital of the great nation of the Malavas, who consolidated themselves under Vikramaditya in the first century before Christ.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Here they set the outcome of their endeavour and called him Kalidasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The country of Avunti<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="176" href="#">5</a> had always played a considerable part in our ancient history<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="177" href="#">6</a> for which the genius, taste and high courage of its inhabitants fitted it and Ujjaini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="178" href="#">7</a> their future capital was always a famous, beautiful and wealthy city; but until the rise of Vikrama it seems<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="179" href="#">8</a> to have been disunited and therefore unable to work out fully the great destiny for which the taste, genius [    ]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="180" href="#">9</a> marked it out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Moreover the temperament of the nation had not fitted it to be the centre of Aryan civilisation in the old times when that civilisation was preponderatingly moral and intellectual.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> Central nations which produced Draupadie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="184" href="#">13</a>, Bhema<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="185" href="#">14</a>, Urjouna<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="186" href="#">15</a>, Bhishma, Vyasa and Srikrishna; neither were they quite akin to the searchingly logical, philosophic and scholastic temperament of the half Dravidian southern nations which produced the great grammarians and commentators and the mightiest of the purely logical philosophers, Madhva, Ramanuja, Shankaracharya.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Malavas were Westerners and the Western nations of India have always been material, practical and sensuous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>For the different races of this country have preserved their basic temperaments with a marvellous conservative power; modified and recombined they have been in no case radically altered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Bengal colonised from the west by the Chedies<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="187" href="#">16</a> and Haihayas and from the north by Coshalas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="188" href="#">17</a> and Magadhans, contains at present the most gentle, sensitive and emotional of the Indian races, also the most anarchic, self-willed, averse to control and in all things extreme; there is not much difference between the characters of Shishupal and that thoroughly Bengali king and great captain, Pratapaditya; the other side shows itself especially in the women who are certainly the tenderest<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="189" href="#">18</a>, purest and most gracious and loving in the whole world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Bengal has accordingly a literature far surpassing any other in an Indian tongue for emotional and lyrical power, loveliness of style and form and individual energy and initiative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The North West, inheritor of the Kurus, has on the other hand produced the finest modern Vedantic poetry full of intellectual loftiness, insight and profundity, the poetry of Suradasa and Tulsi; its people are still the most sincerely orthodox and the most attached to the old type of thought and character, while the Rajputs, who are only a Central Nation which has drifted westward, preserved longest the heroic and chivalrous tradition of the Bharatas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The Dravidians of the South, though they no longer show that magnificent culture and originality which made them the preservers and renovators of the higher Hindu thought and religion in its worst days, are yet, as we all know, far more genuinely learned and philosophic in their cast of thought and character than any other Indian race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Similarly the West also preserves its tradition; the Punjab is typified by its wide acceptance of such crude<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="190" href="#">19</a>, but<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="191" href="#">20</a> practical and active religions as those of Nanak <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> and Dayanunda<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="192" href="#">21</a> Saraswati, religions which have been unable to take healthy root beyond the frontier of the five rivers; Gujarat and Sindh show the same practical temper by their success in trade and commerce, but the former has preserved more of the old Western materialism and sensuousness than its neighbours.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Finally the Mahrattas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="193" href="#">22</a>, perhaps the strongest and sanest race in India today, present a very peculiar and interesting type; they are southwestern and blend two very different characters; fundamentally a material and practical race — they are for instance extremely deficient in the romantic and poetical side of the human<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="194" href="#">23</a> temperament — a race of soldiers and politicians, they have yet caught from the Dravidians a deep scholastic and philosophical tinge which along with a basic earnestness and capacity for high things has kept them true to Hinduism, gives a certain distinction to their otherwise matter-of-fact nature and promises much for their future development.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1004"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But the Malavas were a far greater, more versatile and culturable race than any which now represent the West; they had an aesthetic catholicity, a many sided curiosity and receptiveness which enabled them to appreciate learning, high moral ideals and intellectual daring and ardour and assimilate them as far as was consistent with their own root-temperament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless that root-temperament remained material and sensuous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>When therefore the country falling from its old pure moral ideality and heroic intellectualism, weakened in fibre and sunk<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="195" href="#">24</a> towards hedonism and materialism, the centre of its culture and national life began to drift westward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Transferred by Agnimitra in the second century to Videsha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="196" href="#">25</a> of the Dasharnas close to the Malavas, it finally found its true equilibrium in the beautiful and aesthetic city of Ujjaini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="197" href="#">26</a> which the artistic and sensuous genius of the Malavas had prepared to be a fit and noble capital of Hindu art, poetry and greatness throughout its most versatile and luxurious age.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>That position Ujjaini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="198" href="#">27</a> enjoyed until the nation began to crumble under the shock of new ideas and new forces and the centre of gravity shifted southwards to Devagirrie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="199" href="#">28</a> of the Jadhavas and finally to Dravidian Vijayanagara, the last considerable seat of independent Hindu culture and national greatness.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Age of Kalidasa</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1007"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Valmiki, Vyasa and Kalidasa are the essence of the history of ancient India; if all else were lost, they would still be its sole and sufficient cultural history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Their poems are types and exponents of three periods in the development of the human soul, types and exponents also of the three great powers which dispute and clash in the imperfect and half-formed temperament and harmonise in the formed and perfect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>At the same time their works are pictures at once minute and grandiose of three moods of our Aryan civilisation, of which the first was predominatingly moral, the second predominatingly intellectual, the third predominatingly material.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The fourth power of the soul, the spiritual, which can alone govern and harmonise the others by fusion with them, had not, though it pervaded and powerfully influenced each successive development, any separate age of predominance, did not like the others possess the whole race with a dominating obsession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is because, conjoining in themselves the highest and most varied poetical gifts, they at the same time represent and mirror their age and humanity by their interpretative largeness and power that our three chief poets hold their supreme place and bear comparison with the greatest world-names, with Homer<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="201" href="#">1</a>, Shakespeare and Dante.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1008"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It has been said, truly, that the Ramayana represents an ideal society and assumed, illogically, that it must therefore represent an altogether imaginary one.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The argument ignores the alternative of a real society idealised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>No poet could evolve entirely out of his own imagination a picture at once so colossal, so minute and so consistent in every detail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>No number of poets could do it without stumbling into fatal incompatibilities either of fact or of view, such as we find defacing the Mahabharata.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>This is not the place to discuss the question of Valmiki’s age and authorship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>This much, however, may be said that after excluding the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 157</p>
<p class="PE"> Uttarakanda, which is a later work, and some amount of interpolation, for the most part easy enough to detect, and reforming the text which is not unfrequently in a state of truly shocking confusion, the Ramayana remains on the face of it the work of a single mighty and embracing mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is not easy to say whether it preceded or followed in date Vyasa’s epic; it is riper in form and tone, has some aspects of a more advanced and mellow culture, and yet it gives the general impression of a younger humanity and an earlier less sophisticated and complex mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The nature of the poem and much of its subject matter might at least justify the conclusion that Valmiki wrote in a political and social atmosphere much resembling that which surrounded Vyasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>He lived, that is to say, in an age of approaching<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="202" href="#">2</a> if not<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="203" href="#">3</a> present disorder and turmoil, of great revolutions and unbridled aristocratic violence, when the governing chivalry, the Kshatriya caste, in its pride of strength was asserting its own code of morals as the one rule of conduct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We may note the plain assertion of this stand-point by Jarasandha in the Mahabharata and Valmiki’s emphatic and repeated protest against it through the mouth of Rama.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This ethical code was like all aristocratic codes of conduct full of high chivalry and the spirit of <i>noblesse oblige</i>, but a little loose in sexual morality on the masculine side and indulgent to violence and the strong hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>To the pure and delicate moral temperament of Valmiki, imaginative, sensitive, enthusiastic, shot through with rays of visionary idealism and ethereal light, this looseness and violence were shocking and abhorrent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>He could sympathise with them, as he sympathised with all that was wild and evil and anarchic, with the imaginative and poetical side of his nature, because he was a universal creative mind driven by his art-sense to penetrate, feel and re-embody all that the world contained; but to his intellect and peculiar emotional temperament they were distasteful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>He took refuge therefore in a past age of national greatness and virtue, distant enough to be idealised, but near enough to have left sufficient materials for a great picture of civilisation which would serve his purpose, — an age, it is important to note, of grandiose imperial equipoise, such as must have existed in some form at least since <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> a persistent tradition of it runs through Sanskrit literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In the framework of this imperial age, his puissant imagination created a marvellous picture of the human world as it might be if the actual and existing forms and material<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="204" href="#">4</a> of society were used to the best and purest advantage, and an equally marvellous picture of another non-human world in which aristocratic violence, strength, self-will, lust and pride ruled supreme and idealised or rather colossalised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>He brought these two worlds into warlike collision by the hostile meeting of their champions and utmost evolutions of their peculiar character-types, Rama and Ravana, and so created the Ramayana, the grandest and most paradoxical poem in the world, which becomes unmatchably sublime by disdaining all consistent pursuit of sublimity, supremely artistic by putting aside all the conventional limitations of art, magnificently dramatic by disregarding all dramatic illusion, and uniquely epic by handling the least as well as the most epic material.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Not all perhaps can enter at once into the spirit of this masterpiece; but those who have once done so, will never admit any poem in the world as its superior.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1009"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>My point here, however, is that it gives us the picture of an entirely moralised civilisation, containing indeed vast material development and immense intellectual power, but both moralised and subordinated to the needs of purity of temperament and delicate ideality of action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Valmiki’s mind seems nowhere to be familiarised with the high-strung intellectual gospel of a high and severe Dharma culminating in a passionless activity, raised to a supreme spiritual significance in the Gita, which is one great keynote of the Mahabharata.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Had he known it, the strong leaven of sentimentalism and femininity<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="205" href="#">5</a> in his nature might well have rejected it; such temperaments when they admire strength, admire it manifested and forceful rather than self-contained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Valmiki’s characters act from emotional or imaginative enthusiasm, not from intellectual conviction; an enthusiasm of morality actuates Rama, an enthusiasm of immorality tyrannises over Ravana.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Like all mainly moral temperaments, he instinctively insisted on one old established code of morals being universally observed as the only basis of ethical stability, avoided </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 159</p>
<p class="PE"> casuistic developments and distasted innovators in metaphysical thought as by their persistent and searching questions dangerous to the established bases of morality, especially to its wholesome ordinariness and everydayness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Valmiki, therefore, the father of our secular poetry, stands for that early and finely moral civilisation which was the true heroic age of the Hindu spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1010"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The poet of the Mahabharata lives nearer to the centre of an era of aristocratic turbulence and disorder.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>If there is any kernel of historic truth in the story of the poem, it records the establishment of those imperial forms of government and society which Valmiki had idealised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Behind its poetic legend it celebrates and approves the policy of a great Kshatriya leader of men who aimed at the subjection of his order to the rule of a central imperial power which should typify its best tendencies and control or expel its worst.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But while Valmiki was a soul out of harmony with its surroundings and looking back to an ideal past, Vyasa was a man of his time, profoundly in sympathy with it, full of its tendencies, hopeful of its results and looking forward to an ideal future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The one might be described as a conservative idealist advocating return to a better but departed model, the other is a progressive realist looking forward to a better but unborn model.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Vyasa accordingly does not revolt from the aristocratic code of morality; it harmonises with his own proud and strong spirit and he accepts it as a basis for conduct, but purified and transfigured by the illuminating idea of the <span class="devan">niṣkāma </span>dharma<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="206" href="#">6</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1011"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But above all intellectuality is his grand note, he is profoundly interested in ideas, in metaphysics, in ethical problems; he subjects morality to casuistic tests from which the more delicate moral tone of Valmiki’s spirit shrank; he boldly erects above ordinary ethics a higher principle of conduct having its springs in intellect and strong character; he treats government and society from the standpoint of a practical and discerning statesmanlike mind, idealising solely for the sake of a standard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>He touches in fact all subjects, and whatever he touches he makes fruitful and interesting by originality, penetration and a sane and bold vision.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>In all this he is the son of the civilisation </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 160</p>
<p class="PE"> he has mirrored to us, a civilisation in which both morality and material development are powerfully intellectualised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Nothing is more remarkable in all the characters of the Mahabharata than this puissant intellectualism; every action of theirs seems to be impelled by an immense driving force of mind solidifying in character and therefore conceived and outlined as in stone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>This orgiastic force of the intellect is at least as noticeable as the impulse of moral or immoral enthusiasm behind each great action of the Ramayana.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Throughout the poem the victorious and manifold mental activity of an age is prominent and gives its character to its civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>There is far more of thought in action than in the Ramayana, far less of thought in repose; the one pictures a time of gigantic creative ferment and disturbance; the other, as far as humanity is concerned, an ideal age of equipoise, tranquillity and order.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1012"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Many centuries after these poets, perhaps a thousand years or even more, came the third great embodiment of the national consciousness, Kalidasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>There is a far greater difference between the civilisation he mirrors than between Vyasa’s and Valmiki’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>He came when the daemonic orgy of character and intellect had worked itself out and ended in producing at once its culmination and reaction in Buddhism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>There was everywhere noticeable a petrifying of the national temperament, visible to us in the tendency to codification; philosophy was being codified, morals were being codified, knowledge of any and every sort was being codified; it was on one side of its nature an age of scholars, legists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="207" href="#">7</a>, dialecticians, philosophical formalisers.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> of facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>I do not think, indeed, it can be maintained that this period, call it classical or material or what one will, was marked off from its predecessor by any clear division: such a partition would be contrary to the law of human development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>Almost all the concrete features of the age may be found as separate facts in ancient India: codes existed from old time; art and drama were of fairly ancient origin, to whatever date we may assign their development; physical yoga processes existed almost from the first, and the material development portrayed in the Ramayana and Mahabharata is hardly less splendid than that of which the Raghuvamsa<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="208" href="#">8</a> is so brilliant a picture.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>In obedience to this impulse the centuries between the rise of Buddhism and the advent of Shankaracharya became, though not agnostic and sceptical, for they rejected violently the doctrines of Charvak, yet profoundly scientific and outward-going even in their spiritualism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>It was therefore the great age of formalised metaphysics, science, law, art and the sensuous luxury which accompanies the arts.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1013"><!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Nearer the beginning than the end of this period, when India was systematising her philosophies and developing her arts and sciences, turning from Upanishad to Purana, from the high rarefied peaks of early Vedanta and Sankhya with their inspiring sublimities and bracing keenness to physical methods of ascetic yoga and the dry intellectualism of metaphysical logic or else to the warm sensuous humanism of emotional religion, — before its full tendencies had asserted themselves, in some spheres before it had taken the steps its attitude portended, Kalidasa arose in Ujjayini and gathered up in himself its present tendencies while he foreshadowed many of its future developments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>He himself must have been a man gifted with all the learning of his age, rich, aristocratic, moving wholly in high society, familiar with and fond of life in the most luxurious metropolis of his time, passionately attached to the arts, acquainted with the sciences, deep in law and learning, versed in the formalised </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 162</p>
<p class="PE"> philosophies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>He has some notable resemblances to Shakespeare; among others his business was, like Shakespeare’s, to sum up the immediate past in the terms of the present: at the same time he occasionally informed the present with hints of the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Like Shakespeare also he seems not to have cared deeply for religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>In creed he was a Vedantist and in ceremony perhaps a Siva-worshipper<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="209" href="#">9</a>, but he seems rather to have accepted these as the orthodox forms of his time and country, recommended to him by his intellectual preference and aesthetic affinities, than to have satisfied with them any profound religious want.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>In morals also he accepted and glorified the set and scientifically elaborate ethics of the codes, but seems himself to have been destitute of the finer elements of morality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>We need not accept any of the ribald and witty legends with which the Hindu decadence surrounded his name; but no unbiassed student of Kalidasa’s poetry can claim for him either moral fervour or moral strictness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>His writings show indeed a keen appreciation of high ideal and lofty thought, but the appreciation is aesthetic in its nature: he elaborates and seeks to bring out the effectiveness of these on the imaginative sense of the noble and grandiose, applying to the things of the mind and soul the same aesthetic standard as to the things of sense themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>He has also the natural high aristocratic feeling for all that is proud and great and vigorous, and so far as he has it, he has exaltation and sublimity; but aesthetic grace and beauty and symmetry sphere in the sublime and prevent it from standing out with the bareness and boldness which is the sublime’s natural presentation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>His poetry has, therefore, never been, like the poetry of Valmiki and Vyasa, a great dynamic force for moulding heroic character or noble or profound temperament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>In all this he represented the highly vital and material civilisation to which he belonged.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1014"><!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Yet some dynamic force a poet must have, some general human inspiration of which he is the supreme exponent; or else he cannot rank with the highest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa is the great, the supreme poet of the senses, of aesthetic beauty, of sensuous emotion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>His main achievement is to have taken every poetic element, all great poetical forms, and subdued them to a harmony of artistic </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 163</p>
<p class="PE"> perfection set in the key of sensuous beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>In continuous gift of seizing an object and creating it to the eye he has no rival in literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>A strong visualising faculty such as the greatest poets have in their most inspired descriptive moments, was with Kalidasa an abiding and unfailing power, and the concrete presentation which this definiteness of vision demanded, suffused with an intimate and sovereign feeling for beauty of colour and beauty of form, constitutes the characteristic Kalidasian manner.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>He is besides a consummate artist, profound in conception and suave in execution, a master of sound and language who has moulded for himself out of the infinite possibilities of the Sanskrit tongue a verse and diction which are absolutely the grandest, most puissant and most full-voiced of any human speech, a language of the Gods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>The note struck by Kalidasa when he built Sanskrit into that palace of noble sound, is the note which meets us in almost all the best work<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="210" href="#">10</a> of the classic literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>Its characteristic features of style are a compact but never abrupt brevity, a soft gravity and smooth majesty, a noble harmony of verse, a strong and lucid beauty of chiselled prose, above all an epic precision of phrase, weighty, sparing and yet full of colour and sweetness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_73"><!-- --></a>Moreover it is admirably flexible, suiting itself to all forms from the epic to the lyric, but most triumphantly to the two greatest, the epic and the drama.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>In his epic style Kalidasa adds to these permanent features a more than Miltonic fullness and grandiose pitch of sound and expression, in his dramatic an extraordinary grace and suavity which makes it adaptable to conversation and the expression of dramatic shade and subtly blended emotion.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1015"><!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>With these supreme gifts Kalidasa had the advantage of being born into an age with which he was in temperamental sympathy and a civilisation which lent itself naturally to his peculiar descriptive genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>It was an aristocratic civilisation, as indeed were those which had preceded it, but it far more nearly resembled the aristocratic civilisations of Europe by its material luxury, its aesthetic tastes, its polite culture, its keen worldly wisdom and its excessive appreciation of wit and learning.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_78"><!-- --></a>It was bad taste to be irreligious, but it was not bad taste to be sensual or even in some respects immoral.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_79"><!-- --></a>The splendid and luxurious courts of this period supported the orthodox religion and morals out of convention, conservatism, the feeling for established order and the inherited tastes and prejudices of centuries, not because they fostered any deep religious or ethical sentiment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_80"><!-- --></a>Yet they applauded high moral ideas if presented to them in cultured and sensuous poetry much in the same spirit that they applauded voluptuous description similarly presented.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_81"><!-- --></a>The ideals of morality were much lower than of old; free drinking was openly recognised and indulged in by both sexes; purity of life was less valued than in any other period of our civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_82"><!-- --></a>Yet the unconquerable monogamous instinct of the high-class Hindu woman seems to have prevented promiscuous vice and the disorganisation of the home which was the result of a similar state of society in ancient Rome, in Italy of the Renascence, in France under the Bourbons and in England under the later Stuarts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>The old spiritual tendencies were also rather latent than dead, the mighty pristine ideals still existed in theory, — they are outlined with extraordinary grandeur by Kalidasa, — nor had they yet been weakened or lowered to a less heroic key.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>It was a time in which one might expect to meet the extremes of indulgence side by side with the extremes of renunciation; for the inherent spirituality of the Hindu nature finally revolted against the splendid and unsatisfying life of the senses.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_86"><!-- --></a>The greater writer lived evidently in the full heyday of the material age, and there is no sign of any setting in of the sickness and dissatisfaction and disillusionment which invariably follow a long outburst of materialism.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE"> as living things, the sentimental feeling of brotherhood with animals which had influenced and been encouraged by Buddhism, the romantic mythological world still farther romanticised by Kalidasa’s warm humanism and fine poetic sensibility, gave him exquisite grace and grandeur of background and scenic variety.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_90"><!-- --></a>The delight of the eye, the delight of the ear, smell, palate, touch, the satisfaction of the imagination and taste are the texture of his poetical creation, and into this he has worked the most beautiful flowers of emotion and intellectual or aesthetic ideality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_91"><!-- --></a>The scenery of his work is a universal paradise of beautiful things.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_93"><!-- --></a>And yet this poetry does not swim in languor, does not dissolve itself in sensuous weakness; it is not heavy with its own dissoluteness, heavy of curl and heavy of eyelid, cloyed by its own sweets, as the poetry of the senses usually is.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_94"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa is saved from this by the chastity of his style, his aim at burdened precision and energy of phrase, his unsleeping artistic vigilance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1017"><!--SENT--><a name="s_95"><!-- --></a>As in the Ramayana and Mahabharata we have an absorbing intellect impulse or a dynamic force of moral or immoral excitement driving the characters, so we have in Kalidasa an intense hedonistic impulse thrilling through speech and informing action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_96"><!-- --></a>An imaginative pleasure in all shades of thought and of sentiment, a rich delight of the mind in its emotions, a luxuriousness of ecstasy and grief, a free abandonment to amorous impulse and rapture, a continual joy of life and seeking for<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="211" href="#">11</a> beauty mark the period when India, having for the time exhausted the possibilities of soul-experience attainable through the spirit and the imaginative reason, was now attempting to find out the utmost each sense could feel, probing and sounding the soul-possibilities in matter and even seeking God through the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_97"><!-- --></a>The emotional religion of the Vaishnava Puranas which takes as its type of the relation between the human soul and the Supreme the passion of a woman for her lover, was already developing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_98"><!-- --></a>The corresponding Tantric development of Shaivism may not yet have established itself fully; but the concretisation of the idea of Purusha-Prakriti, the union of Ishwara and Shakti, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 166</p>
<p class="PE"> from which it arose, was already there in the symbolic legends of the Puranas and one of these is the subject of Kalidasa’s greatest epic poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_99"><!-- --></a>The Birth of the War-God stands on the same height in classical Sanskrit as the Paradise Lost in English literature: it is the masterpiece and <i>magnum opus</i> of the age on the epic level.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_100"><!-- --></a>The central idea of this great unfinished poem, the marriage of Siva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="212" href="#">12</a> and Parvati, typified in its original idea the union of Purusha and Prakriti, the supreme Soul and dynamic Nature by which the world is created; but this type of divine legend was used esoterically to typify also the Nature-Soul’s search for and attainment of God, and something of this conception pierces through the description of Parvati’s seeking after Siva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="213" href="#">13</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_101"><!-- --></a>Such was the age of Kalidasa, the temper of the civilisation which produced him; other poets of the time expressed one side of it or another, but his work is its splendid integral epitome, its picture of many composite hues and tones.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_102"><!-- --></a>Of the temperament of that civilisation the Seasons is an immature poetic self-expression, the House of Raghu the representative epic, the 
<i>Cloud Messenger</i> the descriptive elegy, Shakuntala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="214" href="#">14</a> with its two sister loveplays intimate dramatic pictures and the Birth of the War-God the grand religious fable.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1018"><!--SENT--><a name="s_104"><!-- --></a>It was the supreme misfortune of India that before she was able to complete the round of her experience and gather up the fruit of her long millenniums of search and travail by commencing a fourth and more perfect age in which moral, intellectual and material development should be all equally harmonised and all spiritualised, the inrush of barbarians broke in finally on her endless solitary tapasya of effort and beat her national life into fragments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_105"><!-- --></a>A preparation for such an age may be glimpsed in the new tendencies of spiritual seeking that began with Shankara and continued in later Vaishnavism and Shaivism and in new turns of poetry and art, but it found no opportunity of seizing on the total life of the nation and throwing it into another mould.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_106"><!-- --></a>The work was interrupted before it had well begun; </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 167</p>
<p class="PE"> and India was left with only the remnants of the culture of the material age to piece out her existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_107"><!-- --></a>Yet even the little that was done afterwards, proved to be much; for it saved her from gradually petrifying and perishing as almost all the old civilisations, Assyria<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="217" href="#">17</a>, Egypt, Greece, Rome, petrified and perished, as the material civilisation of Europe, unless spiritualised, must before long petrify and perish.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_108"><!-- --></a>That there is still an unexhausted vitality in her, that she yet nourishes the seeds of re-birth and renewal, we owe to Shankara and his successors and the great minds and souls that came after them.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1021"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Of Kalidasa, the man who thus represents<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="218" href="#">1</a> one of the greatest periods in our civilisation and typifies so many sides and facets of it in his writing, we know if possible even less than of Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="219" href="#">2</a> and Vyasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is probable but not certain that he was a native of Malwa<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="220" href="#">3</a> born not in the capital Ujjaini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="221" href="#">4</a>, but in one of those villages of which he speaks in the Cloud-Messenger and that he afterwards resorted to the capital and wrote under the patronage of the great Vicramaditya<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="222" href="#">5</a> who founded the era of the Malavas in the middle of the first century before Christ.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Of his attainments, his creed, his character we may gather something from his poetry, but external facts we have none.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>There is indeed a mass of apocryphal anecdotes about him couching a number of witticisms and ingenuities mostly ribald, but these may be safely discredited.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="223" href="#">6</a>, Vyasa and Kalidasa, our three greatest names, are to us, outside their poetical creation, names merely and nothing more.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1022"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This is an exceedingly fortunate circumstance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The natural man within us rebels indeed against such a void; who Kalidasa was, what was his personal as distinguished from his poetic<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="224" href="#">7</a> individuality, what manner of man was the great King whose patronage he enjoyed, who were his friends, who his rivals and how he dealt with either or both, whether or not he was a lover of wine and women in practice as well as in imagination, under what special surroundings he wrote and who were the minds by whom he was most influenced, all this the natural man clamours to know; and yet all these are things we are very fortunate not to know.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The historical method is certainly an attractive one and it leads to some distinct advantages, for it decidedly aids those who are not gifted with fine insight and literary discrimination, to understand certain sides of a poet’s work more clearly and intelligently.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But while it increases our </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 169</p>
<p class="PE"> knowledge of the workings of the human mind it does not in the end assist or improve our critical appreciation of poetry; it helps to an understanding of the man and of those aspects of his poetry which concern his personal individuality but it obstructs our clear and accurate impression of the work and its value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The supporters of the historical method put the cart before the horse and placing themselves between the shafts do a great deal of useless though heroic labour in dragging both.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>They insist on directing that attention to the poet which should be directed to the poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>After assimilating a man’s literary work and realising its value first to ourselves and then in relation to the eternal nature and scope of poetry, we may and indeed must, — for if not consciously aimed at, it must have been insensibly formed in the mind, — attempt to realize to ourselves an idea of his poetic individuality from the data he himself has provided for us; and the idea so formed will be the individuality of the man so far as we can assimilate him, the only part of him therefore that is of real value to us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The individuality of Shakespeare as expressed in his recorded actions and his relations to his contemporaries is a matter of history and has nothing to do with appreciation of his poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It may interest me as a study of human character and intellect but I have no concern with it when I am reading Hamlet or even when I am reading the Sonnets; on the contrary it may often come between me and the genuine revelation of the poet in his work, for actions seldom reveal more than the outer, bodily and sensational man while his word takes us within to the mind and the reason, the receiving and the selecting parts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="225" href="#">8</a> of him which are his truer self.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It may matter to the pedant or the gossip within me whether the sonnets were written to William Herbert or to Henry Wriothesley or to William Himself, whether the dark woman whom Shakespeare loved against his better judgment<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="226" href="#">9</a> was Mary Fitton or someone else or nobody at all, whether the language is that of hyperbolical compliment to a patron or that of an actual passionate affection; but to the lover of poetry in me these things do not matter at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It may be a historical fact that Shakespeare when he sat down to write these poems intended to use the affected language of conventional and fulsome flattery; if <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> so, it does not exalt our idea of his character; but after all it was only the bodily and sensational case of that huge spirit which so intended, — the food-sheath and the life-sheath of him, to use Hindu phraseology; but the mind, the soul which was the real Shakespeare felt, as he wrote, every phase of the passion he was expressing to the very utmost, felt precisely those exultations, chills of jealousy and disappointment, noble affections, dark and unholy fires, and because he felt them, he was able so to express them that the world still listens and is moved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The passion was there in the soul of the man, — whether as a potential force or an experience from a past life, matters very little, — and it forms therefore part of his poetic individuality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But if we allow the alleged historical fact to interfere between us and this individuality, the feelings with which we ought to read the Sonnets, admiration, delight, sympathy, rapt interest in a soul struggling through passion towards self-realisation, will be disturbed by other feelings of disgust and nausea or at the best pity for a man who with such a soul within him, prostituted its powers to the interests of his mere bodily covering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Both our realisation of the true Shakespeare and our enjoyment of his poetry will thus be cruelly and uselessly marred.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>This is the essential defect which vitiates the theory of the man and his milieu.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The man in Dr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Johnson expressed himself in his conversation and therefore his own works are far less important to us than Boswell’s record of his daily talk; the man in Byron expresses himself in his letters as well as his poetry and both have therefore to be read.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It is only the most sensational and therefore the lowest natures that express themselves mainly by their actions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In the case of great poets with whom expression is an instrument that answers spontaneously and accurately to the touch of the soul, it is in their work that we shall find them, the whole of them and not only that meagre part which struggled out brokenly and imperfectly in the shape of action.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->I. Its Authenticity</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1028"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The “Seasons” of Kalidasa is one of those early works of a great poet which are even more interesting to a student of his evolution than his later masterpieces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We see his characteristic gift even in the immature workmanship and uncertain touch and can distinguish the persistent personality in spite of the defective self-expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Where external record is scanty, this interest is often disturbed by the question of authenticity, and where there is any excuse for the doubt, it has first to be removed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The impulse which leads us to deny authenticity to early and immature work, is natural and almost inevitable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>When we turn from the great harmonies and victorious imaginations of the master to the raw and perhaps faltering workmanship of these uncertain beginnings, we are irresistibly impelled to cry out, “This is not by the same hand.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But the impulse, however natural, is not always reasonable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The maxim that a poet is born and not made is only true in the sense that great poetical powers are there in the mind of the child, and in this sense the same remark might be applied with no less truth to every species of human genius; philosophers, sculptors, painters, critics, orators, statesmen are all born and not made.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But because poetical genius is rarer or at any rate wider and more lasting in its appeal than any other, the popular mind with its ready gift for seizing one aspect of truth out of many and crystallizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="249" href="#">1</a> error into the form of a proverb, has exalted the poet into a splendid freak of Nature exempt from the general law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>If a man without the inborn oratorical fire may be trained into a good speaker or another without the master’s inspiration of form and colour </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 176</p>
<p class="PE"> work out for himself a blameless technique, so too may a meagre talent become by diligence a machine for producing elegant verse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But poetic genius needs experience and self-discipline as much as any other, and by its very complexity more than most.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>This is eminently true of great poets with a varied gift.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>A narrow though a high faculty works best on a single line and may show perfection at an early stage; but powerful and complex minds like Shakespeare or Kalidasa seldom find themselves before a more advanced period.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Their previous work is certain to be full of power, promise and genius, but it will also be flawed, unequal and often imitative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This imperfection arises naturally from the greater difficulty in imposing the law of harmony of their various gifts on the bodily case which is the instrument of the spirit’s self-expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>To arrive at this harmony requires time and effort, and meanwhile the work will often be halting and unequal, varying between inspiration expressed and the failure of vision or expression.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1029"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>There is no more many-sided, rich and flexible genius in literature than Kalidasa’s, and in his case especially we must be on our guard against basing denial of authenticity on imperfection and minor differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We have to judge, first, by the presence or absence of the essential and indefinable self of Kalidasa which we find apparent in all his indubitable work, however various the form or subject, and after that on those nameable characteristics which are the grain and fibre of his genius and least imitable by others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In the absence of external evidence, which is in itself of little value unless received from definite and contemporary or almost contemporary sources, the test of personality is all-important.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Accidents and details are only useful as corroborative evidence, for these are liable to variation and imitation; but personality is a distinguishable and permanent presence as fugitive to imitation as to analysis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Even a slight fineness of literary palate can perceive the difference between the Nalodaya and Kalidasa’s genuine work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Not only does it belong to an age or school in which poetic taste was debased and artificial, — for it is a poetical counterpart of those prose works for whose existence the display of scholarship seems to be the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 177</p>
<p class="PE"> chief justification, — but it presents in this matter of personality and persistent characteristics no sufficient point of contact either with the Shakuntala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="250" href="#">2</a> or the Kumarasambhava<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="251" href="#">3</a> or even with the House of Raghu.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But in the Seasons, Kalidasa’s personality is distinctly perceived as well as his main characteristics, his force of vision, his architecture of style, his pervading sensuousness, the peculiar temperament of his similes, his characteristic strokes of thought and imagination, his individual and inimitable cast of description.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Much of it is as yet in a half-developed state, crude consistence not yet fashioned with the masterly touch he soon manifested, but Kalidasa is there quite as evidently as Shakespeare in his earlier work, the Venus and Adonis or Lucrece.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Defects which the riper Kalidasa avoids, are not uncommon in this poem, — repetition of ideas, use of more words than are absolutely required, haphazard recurrence of words and phrases, not to produce a designed effect but from carelessness, haste or an insufficient vocabulary; there is moreover a constant sense of uncertainty in the touch and a frequent lack of finished design.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The poet has been in too much haste to vent his sense of poetic power and not sufficiently careful that the expression should be the best he could compass.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>And yet immature, greatly inferior in chastity and elegance to his best work, marred by serious faults of conception, bearing evidence of hurry and slovenliness in the execution, the Seasons is for all this not only suffused by a high though unchastened beauty, but marked with many of the distinctive signs of Kalidasa’s strong and exuberant genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The defects are those natural to the early work of a rich sensuous temperament, eagerly conscious of poetic power but not yet instructed and chastened.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->II. The Substance of the Poem</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1030"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa’s Seasons is perhaps the first poem in any literature written with the express object of describing Nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It is precisely similar in its aim to a well-known eighteenth-century </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 178</p>
<p class="PE"> failure in the same direction — Thomson’s Seasons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The names tally, the forms correspond, both poems adopting the plan of devoting a canto to each season, and the method so far agrees that the poets have attempted to depict each season in its principal peculiarities, scenes and characteristic incidents.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But here all parallel ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Wide as the gulf between the genius of one of the greatest world-poets and the talent of the eighteenth-century versifier is the difference between the gathered strength and compact force, the masterly harmonies and the living truth of the ancient Indian poem and the diffuse artificiality and rhetoric of the modern counterpart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>And the difference of spirit is not less.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>A poet of the prosaic and artificial age when the Anglo-Saxon mind emerged in England and got itself Gallicised, Thomson was unable to grasp the first psychological laws of such descriptive poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>He fixed his eye on the object, but he could only see the outside of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Instead of creating he tried to photograph.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>And he did not remember or did not know that Nature is nothing to poetry except in so far as it is either a frame, setting or ornament to life or else a living presence to the spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Nature interpreted by Wordsworth as a part of his own and the universal consciousness, by Shakespeare as an accompaniment or note in the orchestral music of life, by more modern poets as an element of decoration in the living world-picture is possible in poetry; as an independent but dead existence it has no place either in the world itself or in the poet’s creation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>In his relations to the external, life and mind are the man, the senses being only instruments, and what he seeks outside himself is a response in kind to his own deeper reality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>What the eye gathers is only important in so far as it is related to this real man or helps this expectation to satisfy itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa with his fine artistic feeling, his vitality and warm humanism and his profound sense of what true poetry must be, appears to have divined from the beginning the true place of Nature in the poet’s outlook.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>He is always more emotional and intellectual than spiritual, like Shakespeare to whom he has so many striking resemblances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>We must not expect from him the magical insight of Valmiki, still less the spiritual discernment of Wordsworth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>He looks inside, but not <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> too far inside.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>But he realises always the supreme importance of life as the only abiding foundation of a poem’s immortality.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1031"><!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The first canto is surcharged with the life of men and animals and the life of trees and plants in summer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>It sets ringing a note of royal power and passion and promises a poem of unexampled vigour and interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>But to play variations on this note through six cantos seems to have been beyond the young poet’s as yet limited experience and narrow imaginative mastery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>He fell back on the life of sensuous passion with images of which, no doubt, his ungoverned youth was most familiar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>But instead of working them into the main thought he turned to them for a prop and, when his imaginative memory failed him, multiplied them to make up the deficiency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>This lapse from artistic uprightness brought its own retribution, as all such lapses will.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>From one error indeed Kalidasa’s vigorous<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="252" href="#">4</a> and aspiring temperament saved him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>He never relaxed into the cloying and effeminate languor of sensuous description which offends us in Keats’ earlier work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>The men of the age with all their sensuousness, luxury and worship of outward beauty were a masculine and strenuous race, and their male and vigorous spirit is as prominent in Kalidasa as his laxer tendencies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>His sensuousness is not coupled with weak self-indulgence, but is rather a bold and royal spirit seizing the beauty and delight of earth to itself and compelling all the senses to minister to the enjoyment of the spirit rather than enslaving the spirit to do the will of the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>The difference perhaps amounts to no more than a lesser or greater force of vitality, but it is, for the purposes of poetry, a real and important difference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>The spirit of delightful weakness swooning with excessive beauty gives a peculiar charm of soft laxness to poems like the Endymion, but it is a weakening charm to which no virile temperament will trust itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The poetry of Kalidasa satisfies the sensuous imagination without enervating the virile chords of character; for virile energy is an unfailing characteristic of the best Sanskrit poetry, and Kalidasa is inferior to none in this respect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>His artistic error has nevertheless had disastrous effects on the substance of his poem.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1032"><!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>It is written in six cantos answering to the six Indian seasons, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 180</p>
<p class="PE"> Summer, Rain, Autumn, Winter, Dew and Spring.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Nothing can exceed the splendour and power of the opening.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>We see the poet revelling in the yet virgin boldness, newness and strength of his genius and confident of winning the kingdom of poetry by violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>For a time the brilliance of his work seems to justify his ardour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>In the poem on Summer we are at once seized by the marvellous force of imagination, by the unsurpassed closeness and clear strenuousness of his gaze on the object; in the expression there is a grand and concentrated precision which is our first example of the great Kalidasian manner, and an imperial power, stateliness and brevity of speech which is our first instance of the high classical diction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>But this canto stands on a higher level than the rest of the poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>It is as if the poet had spent the best part of his force in his first enthusiasm and kept back an insufficient reserve for the sustained power proper to a long poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>The decline in energy does not disappoint at first.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>The poem on the Rains gives us a number of fine pictures with a less vigorous touch but a more dignified restraint and a graver and nobler harmony, and even in the Autumn, where the falling off of vigour becomes very noticeable, there is compensation in a more harmonious finish of style, management and imagery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>We are led to believe that the poet is finding himself and will rise to a finale of flawless beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>Then comes disappointment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_73"><!-- --></a>In the next two cantos Kalidasa seems to lose hold of the subject; the touches of natural description cease or are, with a few exceptions, perfunctory and even conventional, and the full force of his genius is thrown into a series of extraordinary pictures, as vivid as if actually executed in line and colour, of feminine beauty and sensuous passion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>The two elements, never properly fused, cease even to stand side by side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>For all description of Winter we have a few stanzas describing the cold and the appearance of fields, plants, waters in the wintry days, by no means devoid of beauty but wanting in vigour, closeness of vision and eagerness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>In the poem on Dew-tide the original purpose is even fainter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_77"><!-- --></a>Perhaps the quietness of these seasons, the absence in them of the most brilliant pictorial effects and grandest distinctive features, made them a subject uninspiring to the unripeness and <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> love of violence natural to a richly-endowed temperament in its unschooled youth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_78"><!-- --></a>But the Spring is the royal season of the Indian year and should have lent itself peculiarly to Kalidasa’s inborn passion for colour, sweetness and harmony.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_79"><!-- --></a>The closing canto should have been the crown of the poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_80"><!-- --></a>But the poet’s sin pursues him and, though we see a distinct effort to recover the old pure fervour, it is an effort that fails to sustain itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_81"><!-- --></a>There is no falling off in harmonious splendour of sound and language, but the soul of inspired poetic observation ceases to inform this beautiful mould and the close fails and languishes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_82"><!-- --></a>It is noticeable that there is a double close to the Spring, the two versions having been left, after the manner of the old editions, side by side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa’s strong artistic perception must have suffered acutely from the sense of failure in inspiration and he has accordingly attempted to replace the weak close by an improved and fuller cadence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>What is we may presume, the rejected version, is undoubtedly the weaker of the two but neither of them satisfies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_85"><!-- --></a>The poem on Spring which should have been the finest, is the most disappointing in the whole series<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->III. Its Poetic Value</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1033"><!--SENT--><a name="s_87"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless the Seasons is not only an interesting document in the evolution of a poetic genius of the first rank, but in itself a work of extraordinary force and immense promise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_88"><!-- --></a>Many of the most characteristic Kalidasian gifts and tendencies are here, some of them in crude and unformed vigour, but characteristic and unmistakable, giving the poem a striking resemblance of spirit and to some extent of form to the House of Raghu, with a far-off prophecy of the mature manner of Kalidasa in the four great masterpieces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_89"><!-- --></a>There is his power of felicitous and vivid simile; there is the individual turn of his conceits and the single-minded force with which he drives them home; there is his mastering accuracy and lifelikeness in description conspicuous </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 182</p>
<p class="PE"> especially in the choice and building of the circumstantial epithets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_90"><!-- --></a>That characteristic of the poet, not the most fundamental and important, which most struck the ancient critics, <span class="devan">upamāsu kālidāsaḥ</span>, Kalidasa for similes, is everywhere present even in such early and immature work, and already they have the sharp clear Kalidasian ring, true coin of his mint though not yet possessed of the later high values.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_91"><!-- --></a>The deep blue midsummer sky is like a rich purple mass of ground collyrium; girls with their smiling faces and lovelit eyes are like “evenings beautifully jewelled with the moon”; the fires burning in the forest look far-off like clear drops of vermilion; the new blades of grass are like pieces of split emerald; rivers embracing and tearing down the trees on their banks are like evil women distracted with passion slaying their lovers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_92"><!-- --></a>In all these instances we have the Kalidasian simile, a little superficial as yet and self-conscious, but for all that Kalidasian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_93"><!-- --></a>When again he speaks of the moon towards dawn growing pale with shame at the lovelier brightness of a woman’s face, of the rains coming like the pomp of some great king all blazing with lights, huge clouds moving along like elephants, the lightning like a streaming banner and the thunder like a peal of drums, of the clouds like archers shooting their rains at the lover from the rainbow stringed with lightning, one recognises, in spite of the occasional extravagance of phrase and violent fancifulness, the Kalidasian form of conceit, not only in the substance which can be borrowed, but in the wording and most of all in the economy of phrase expressing a lavish and ingenious fancy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_94"><!-- --></a>Still more is this apparent in the sensuous and elaborate comparison of things in Nature to women in ornamental attire, — rivers, autumn, the night, the pale priyungou<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="253" href="#">5</a> creeper.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1034"><!--SENT--><a name="s_95"><!-- --></a>Most decisive of all are the strokes of vivid description that give the poem its main greatness and fulfil its purpose.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_102"><!-- --></a>We watch the beauty of the mountains streaked everywhere with waterfalls, their high rocks kissed by the stooping clouds and their sides a gorgeous chaos of peacocks: on the horizon the great clouds blue as lotus-petals climb hugely into the sky and move across it in slow procession before a sluggish breeze.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_103"><!-- --></a>Or look at yonder covidara tree, its branches troubled softly with wind, swarming with honey-drunken bees and its leaves tender with little opening buds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_104"><!-- --></a>The moon at night gazes down at us like an unveiled face in the skies, the racing stream dashes its ripples in the wild-duck’s face, the wind comes trembling through the burdened rice-stalks, dancing with the crowding courboucs<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="254" href="#">6</a>, making one flowery ripple of the lotus-wooded lake.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_106"><!-- --></a>These descriptions which remain perpetually with the eye, visible and concrete as an actual painting, belong, in the force with which they are visualised and the magnificent architecture of phrase with which they are presented, to Kalidasa alone among Sanskrit poets.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>This power bases itself in its different degrees sometimes on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="263" href="#">2</a> great experience of human life, sometimes on a keen power of observation and accurate imagination making much matter out of a small circle of experience but in its richest possessors on a boundless sympathy with all kinds of humanity accompanied by a power of imbibing and afterwards of selecting and bringing out from oneself at will impressions received from others<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="264" href="#">3</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>This supreme power, European scholars agree, is wanting in Hindu dramatic literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>A mere poet like Goethe may extend unstinted and even superlative<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="265" href="#">4</a> praise to a Shacountala but the wiser critical and scholarly mind passes a far less favourable verdict; there is much art in Hindu poetry, it is said, but no genius; there is plenty of fancy but no imagination; beautiful and even moving poetry is abundant, but the characters are nil; the 
colouring is rich but colour is all<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="266" href="#">5</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Indian scholars trained in our schools to repeat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="267" href="#">6</a> what they have learnt do not hesitate to add their voice to the chorus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="268" href="#">7</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>A Hindu scholar of acute diligence and wide Sanscrit learning has even argued that the Hindu mind is constitutionally incapable of original and living creation; he has alleged the gigantic, living and vigorous personalities of the Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="269" href="#">8</a> as an argument to prove that these characters must have been real men and women, copied from the life; since no Hindu poet could have created character with such truth and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>On the other side the Bengali critics, men of no mean literary taste and perception though inferior in pure verbal scholarship, are agreed in regarding the characters of Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti as beautiful and energetic creations, not less deserving of study than the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="270" href="#">9</a> personalities<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="271" href="#">10</a> of Elizabethan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="272" href="#">11</a> drama.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> This contradiction, violent as it is, is not difficult to understand, since it takes its root in an element always more or less present in criticism, the national element.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>National character<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="273" href="#">12</a>, national prejudices, national training preordain for the bulk of us the spirit in which we shall approach<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="274" href="#">13</a> unfamiliar poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Now the average English mind is capable of appreciating character as manifested in strong action or powerfully revealing speech, but constitutionally dull to the subtleties of civilized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="275" href="#">14</a> character<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="276" href="#">15</a> which have their theatre in the mind and the heart and make of a slight word, a gesture or even silence their sufficient revelation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The nations of Europe, taken in the mass, are still semicivilized; their mind feeds on the physical, external and grossly salient features of life; where there is no brilliance and glare, they are apt to condemn the personality<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="277" href="#">16</a> as characterless.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>A strength that shuns ostentation, a charm that is not luxuriant, not naked to the first glance, are appreciable only to the few select minds who have chastened their natural leanings by a wide and deep culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The Hindu on his side distastes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="278" href="#">17</a> violence in action, excess in speech, ostentation or effusiveness in manner; he demands from his ideal temperance and restraint as well as nobility, truth and beneficence; the Aryan or true gentleman must be <span class="unicod">मिताचारः</span> (<span class="devan">mitācāraḥ</span>) and <span class="unicod">मितभाषी</span>, (<span class="devan">mitābhāṣī</span>) restrained in action and temperate in speech.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1082"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>This national tendency shows itself even in our most vehement work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="279" href="#">18</a> is that<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="280" href="#">19</a> section of our literature which deals most with the external and physical and corresponds best to the European idea of the epic; yet the intellectualism of even the Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="281" href="#">20</a>, its preference of mind-issues to physical and emotional collisions and catastrophes, its continual suffusion of these when they occur with mind and ideality, the civilisation, depth and lack of mere sensational turbulence, in one word the Aryan cast of its characters, are irritating to European<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="282" href="#">21</a> scholars.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Thus a historian of Indian literature complains that Bhema<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="283" href="#">22</a> is the one really<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="284" href="#">23</a> epic character in this poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>He meant, evidently, the one<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="285" href="#">24</a> character in which vast and irresistible strength, ungovernable impetuousness of passion, warlike fury and destroying anger are grandiosely displayed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="286" href="#">25</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But to the Hindu, whose ideas of epic are not coloured with the wrath of Achilles, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 190</p>
<p class="PE"> epic motive and character are not confined to what is impetuous, huge and untamed; he demands a larger field for the epic and does not confine it to savage and half savage epochs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Gentleness, patience, self-sacrifice, purity, the civilized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="287" href="#">26</a> virtues, appear to him as capable of epic treatment as martial fire, brute strength, revenge, anger, hate and ungovernable self-will.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Rama mildly and purely renouncing the empire of the world for the sake of his father’s honour seems to them as epic and mighty a figure as Bhema<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="288" href="#">27</a> destroying Kechaka<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="289" href="#">28</a> in his wild fury of triumphant strength and hatred.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is noteworthy that the European temperament finds vice more interesting than virtue, and in its heart of hearts damns the Christian qualities with faint praise as negative, not positive virtues; the difficulty European writers experience in making good men sympathetic is a commonplace of literary observation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>In all these respects the Hindu attitude is diametrically opposed to the European.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This attitude of the Hindu mind as evinced in the Mahabharata is so intolerable to European scholars that they have been forced to ease their irritation by conjuring up the phantom of an original ballad-epic more like their notions of what an epic should be, an epic in which the wicked characters of the present Mahabharata were the heroes and the divine champions of right of the present Mahabharata were the villains!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The present Mahabharata is, they say, a sanctimonious monastic corruption of the old vigorous and half-savage poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>To the Hindu the theory naturally seems a grotesque perversion of ingenuity but its very grotesqueness is eloquent of the soil it springs from, the soil of the half barbarous temperament of the martial<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="290" href="#">29</a> and industrial Teuton which cannot, even when civilised, entirely sympathise with the intellectual working of more radically civilised types.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This fundamental difference of outlook on character, generating difference in critical appreciation of dramatic and epic characterisation is of general application, but it acquires a peculiar force when we come to consider the Hindu drama; for here the ingrained disparity is emphasized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="291" href="#">30</a> by external conditions.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1083"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It has been pointed out, perhaps too often, that<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="292" href="#">31</a> the Hindu drama presents some<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="293" href="#">32</a> remarkable points of contact with the </p>

<p class="PE"> Elizabethan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>In the mixture of prose and poetry, in the complete freedom with which time and scene<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="294" href="#">33</a> vary, in the romantic lifelikeness of the action, in the mixture of comedy with serious matter, in the gorgeousness of the poetry and the direct appeal to the feelings, both these great literatures closely resemble each other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Yet the differences, though they do not strike us so readily as the similarities, are yet more<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="295" href="#">34</a> vital and go deeper; for the similarities are of form, the differences of spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The Elizabethan drama was a great popular literature which aimed at a vigorous and realistic presentation of life and character such as would please a mixed and not very critical audience; it had therefore the strength and weakness of great popular literature; its strength was an abounding vigour in passion and action, and an unequalled grasp upon life; its weakness a crude violence, imperfection and bungling in workmanship combined with a tendency to exaggerations, horrors and monstrosities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The Hindu drama, on the contrary, was written by men of accomplished culture<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="296" href="#">35</a> for an educated, often a courtly audience and with an eye to an elaborate and well-understood system of poetics.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1084"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="297" href="#">36</a> 
vital law governing Hindu poetics is that it does not seek to represent life and 
character primarily or for their own sake; its aim is fundamentally aesthetic, 
by the delicate and harmonious rendering of passion to awaken<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="298" href="#">37</a> the aesthetic sense of the onlooker and gratify it by moving or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="299" href="#">38</a> subtly observed pictures of human feeling; it did not attempt to seize a man’s spirit by the hair and drag it out into a storm of horror and pity and fear and return it to him drenched, beaten and shuddering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>To the Hindu it would have seemed a savage and inhuman spirit that could take any aesthetic pleasure in the sufferings of an Oedipus or a Duchess of Malfi or in the tragedy of a Macbeth or an Othello.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Partly this arose from the divine tenderness of the Hindu nature, always noble, forbearing and gentle and at that time saturated with the sweet and gracious pity and purity which flowed from the soul of Buddha; but it was also a necessary result of the principle that aesthetic and intellectual pleasure is the first object of all poetic art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Certainly poetry was regarded as a force for elevation as well as for charm, but as it reaches these </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The Hindu mind therefore shrank not only from violence, horror and physical tragedy, the Elizabethan stock-in-trade, but even from the tragic moral<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="301" href="#">40</a> problems which attracted the Greek mind; still less could it have consented to occupy itself with the problems of disease, neurosis and spiritual medicology generally which are the staple of modern drama and fiction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>An atmosphere of romantic beauty, a high urbanity and a gracious equipoise of the feelings, a perpetual confidence in the sunshine and the flowers, are the essential spirit of a Hindu play; pity and terror are used to awaken the feelings, but not to lacerate them, and the drama must close on the note of joy and peace; the clouds are only admitted to make more beautiful the glad sunlight from which all came and into which all must melt away.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>It is in an art like this that the soul finds the repose, the opportunity for being, confirmed in gentleness and in kindly culture, the unmixed intellectual and aesthetic pleasure in quest of which it has turned<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="302" href="#">41</a> away from the crudeness and incoherence of life to the magic regions of Art.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1085"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>When therefore English scholars, fed on the exceedingly strong and often raw meat of the Elizabethans, assert that there are no characters in the Hindu drama, when they attribute this deficiency to the feebleness of inventive power which leads “Asiatic” poetry to concentrate itself on glowing description and imagery, seeking by excess<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="303" href="#">42</a> of ornament to conceal poverty of substance, when even their Indian pupils perverted from good taste and blinded to fine discrimination by a love of the striking and a habit of gross forms and pronounced colours due to the too exclusive study of English poetry, repeat and reenforce<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="304" href="#">43</a> their criticisms, the lover of Kalidasa and his peers need not be alarmed; he need not banish from his imagination the gracious company with which it is peopled as a gilded and soulless list of names<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="305" href="#">44</a>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>There are no<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="321" href="#">10</a> sufficient data to fix Kalidasa’s epoch; he was certainly not later than the 6th century after Christ, certainly not earlier than the 1st. century before; but a chronological margin of seven hundred years is too wide to encourage dogmatism.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1094"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="322" href="#">1</a> is the poet’s second study of kinghood; he differs substantially from Agnimitra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The latter is a prince, a soldier and man of the world yielding by the way to the allurements of beauty, but not preoccupied with passion; the subtitle of the piece might be, in a more innocent sense than Victor Hugo’s, “Le Roi s’amuse”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>He is the mirror of a courteous and self-possessed gentleman, full of mildness and grace, princely tact, savoir-faire, indulgent kindliness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="323" href="#">2</a>, yet energetic withal and quietly resolute in his pleasure as well as in his serious affairs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>“Ah, Sire” says Dharinie with sharp irony “if you only showed as much diplomatic skill and savoir-faire in the affairs of your kingdom, what a good thing it would be”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But one feels that these are precisely the gifts he would show in all his action, that the innocently unscrupulous and quite delightful tact and diplomacy with which he pursues his love-affair is but the mirror of the methods he pursued in domestic politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>We see in him the typical and ideal king of an age hedonistic, poetic, worldly but withal heroic and capable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="324" href="#">3</a> is made of very different material.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>He is a king and a hero, a man of high social and princely virtues, otherwise Kalidasa would not have taken the trouble to depict him; but these qualities are like splendid robes which his nature has put on, and which have become so natural to him that he cannot put them off if he would; they are not the naked essential man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The fundamental Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="325" href="#">4</a> is not the king and the hero but the poet and lover.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The poet on a throne has been the theme of Shakespeare in his Richard II and of Renan in his Antéchrist<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="326" href="#">5</a>; and from these two great studies we can realise the European view of the phenomenon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>To the European mind the meeting of poet and king in one man wears always the appearance of an anomaly, a misplacement, the very qualities which have fitted him to be a poet unfit him to rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>A mastering egotism </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 197</p>
<p class="PE"> becomes the mainspring of the poetic temperament so placed; the imagination of the man is centred in himself, and the realm and people whose destinies are in his hands, seem to him to be created only to minister to his ingenious or soaring fancies and his dramatic, epic or idealistic sense of what should be; his intellect lives in a poetic world of its own and thinks in tropes and figures instead of grappling with the concrete facts of the earth<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="327" href="#">6</a>; hence he is unfitted for action and once absolute power is out of his hands, once he is no longer able to arrange men and events to his liking as if he were a dramatist manoeuvring the creatures of his brain but is called upon to measure his will and ability against others, he fails and his failure leads to tragic issues; for he persists in attempting to weave his own imaginations into life; he will not see facts; he will not recognize the inexorable logic of events.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Hence, though not necessarily a coward, though often a man of real courage and even ability, he plays the part of an incompetent or a weakling or both.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Moreover he tends to become a tyrant, to lose moral perspective and often all sense of proportion and sanity; for he regards himself as the centre of a great drama, and to all who will not play the part he assigns them and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="328" href="#">7</a> satisfy his emotional needs and impulses, to all who get in the way of his imaginative egotism he becomes savage and cruel; his rage when a word of his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="329" href="#">8</a> life-drama is mispronounced or a part ill-studied or a conception not complied with is a magnified reflection of the vexation felt by a dramatist at a similar contretemps in the performance of his darling piece; and unfortunately unlike the playwright he has the power to vent his indignation on the luckless offenders in a fashion only too effective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The last end of the poet-king is almost always tragic, the madhouse, the prison, suicide, exile or the dagger of the assassin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It must be admitted that this dramatic picture largely reflects the facts of history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We know some instances of poet-kings in history, Nero and Ludwig of Bavaria were extreme instances; but we have a far more interesting because typical series in the history of the British isles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The Stuarts were a race of born poets whom the irony of their fate insisted upon placing one after the other upon a throne; with the single exception of Charles II (James VI was a pedant, which <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> for practical purposes is as bad as a poet) they were all men of an imaginative temper, artistic tastes and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="330" href="#">9</a> impossible ideals, and the best of them had in a wonderful<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="331" href="#">10</a> degree the poet’s faculty of imparting this enthusiasm to others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The terrible fate which dogged them was no mysterious doom of the Atridae, but the natural inexorable result of the incompatibility between their temperament and their position.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Charles II was the only capable man in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="332" href="#">11</a> his line, the only one who set before him a worldly and unideal aim and recognising<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="333" href="#">12</a> facts and using the only possible ways and means quietly and patiently accomplished it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The first James had some practical energy, but it was marred by the political idealism, the disregard of a wise opportunism and the tyrannical severity towards those who thwarted him which distinguished his whole dreamy, fascinating and utterly unpractical race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Nor is the type wanting in Indian History.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Sriharsha of Cashmere in the pages of Kalhana affords a most typical picture of the same unhappy temperament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>It is interesting therefore to see how Kalidasa dealt with a similar character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>To our surprise we find that the Hindu poet does not associate incompetence, failure and tragedy with his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="334" href="#">13</a> image of the poet-king; on the contrary Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="335" href="#">14</a> is a Great Emperor, well-loved of his people, an unconquered hero, the valued ally of the Gods, successful in empire, successful in war, successful in love.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Was then Kalidasa at fault in his knowledge of the world and of human nature?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Such a solution would be inconsistent with all we know of the poet’s genius as shown in his other work<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="336" href="#">15</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The truth is that Kalidasa simply gives us the other side of the shield.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It is not an invariable law of human nature that the poetic temperament should be by its nature<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="337" href="#">16</a> absolutely unfitted for practical action and regal power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Nero and Charles I were artistic temperaments cursed with the doom of kingship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon Buonaparte were poets on a throne, and the part they played in history was not that of incompetents and weaklings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>There are times when Nature gifts the poetic temperament with a peculiar grasp of the conditions of action and an irresistible tendency to create their poems not in ink and on paper, but in living characters and on the great canvas of the world; such men become portents <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> and wonders, whom posterity admires or hates but can only imperfectly understand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Like Joan of Arc or Mazzini and Garibaldi they save a dying nation, or like Napoleon and Alexander they dominate a world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>They are only possible because they only get full scope in races which unite with an ardent and heroic temperament a keen susceptibility to poetry in life, idealism, and hero worship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Now the Hindus, before the fibre of their temperament had been loosened by hedonistic materialism on the one side and Buddhistic impracticability on the other, were not only the most ardent and idealistic race in the world, the most ready to put prose behind them, the most dominated by thought and imagination, but also one of the most heroic, and they still preserved much of this ancient temper in the days of Kalidasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It was only natural therefore that the national dramatist in representing the great legendary founder of the Kurus as of the poet-emperor type, should mould him of stronger make and material and not as one of the beautiful porcelain vessels that are broken.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Yet always, even when gifted with the most extraordinary practical abilities, the poetic temperament remains itself and keeps a flaw of weakness in the heart of its strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The temperaments of Alexander and Napoleon were both marked by megalomania, gigantic imaginations, impossible ideals; though not wantonly cruel or tyrannical, they at times showed a singular insensibility to moral restraints and the demands of generous and humane feeling; especially in times of abnormal excitement or temporary indulgence of their passions, the birthmark came out and showed itself in acts of often insane tyranny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>This was especially the case with Alexander; but Napoleon was not free from the same taint.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Alexander, we know, strove consciously to mould his life into an Iliad; Napoleon regarded his as a Titanic epic and when facts would not fit in ideally with his conception of himself as its great protagonist, he would alter and falsify them with as little scruple as a dramatist would feel in dealing licentiously with the facts of history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>All men of this type, moreover, show a strange visionary impracticability in the midst of their practical energy and success, make huge miscalculations and refuse to receive correction, insist that facts shall mould themselves according to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> their own imaginations and are usually dominated by an unconquerable egoism or self-absorption which is not necessarily base or selfish; their success seems as much the result of a favouring destiny as of their own ability and when the favour is withdrawn, they collapse like a house of cards at one blow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Joan of Arc dreamed dreams and saw visions, Mazzini and Garibaldi were impracticable idealists and hated Cavour because he would not idealise along with them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The rock of St Helena, the blazing stake at Rouen, the lifelong impotent exile of Mazzini, the field of [    ]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="338" href="#">17</a> and the island of Caprera, such is the latter end of these great spirits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Alexander was more fortunate, but his greatest good fortune was that he died young; his next greatest that the practical commonsense of his followers prevented him from crossing the Ganges; had Napoleon been similarly forced to recognise<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="339" href="#">18</a> his limit, his end might have been as great as his beginning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="340" href="#">19</a> in the play is equally fortunate; we feel throughout that the power and favour of the Gods is at his back to save him from all evil fortune and the limits of a legend help him as effectually<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="341" href="#">20</a> as an early death helped Alexander.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1095"><!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Kalidasa’s presentation of Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="342" href="#">21</a> therefore is not that of a poetic nature in a false position working out its own ruin; it is rather a study of the poetic temperament in a heroic and royal figure for no issue beyond the study itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>This is in accordance with the temper of the later poetry which, as I have said, troubles itself little with problems, issues and the rest, but is purely romantic, existing only to express disinterested delight in the beauty of human life and emotion and the life and emotion of animate and inanimate Nature.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1096"><!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>When Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="343" href="#">22</a> first appears on the scene it is as the king and hero, the man of prompt courage and action, playing the part which he has assumed like a royal robe of purple; but it is not in the practical side of his character that Kalidasa is interested.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>He has to introduce it only as a background to his inner temperament, in order to save him from the appearance </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 201</p>
<p class="PE"> of frivolous weakness and unworthiness which always surrounds the dilettante in life, the epicure of his own emotions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>This he does with his usual consummate art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="344" href="#">23</a> is introduced to us at the very beginning in a scene of extraordinary swiftness, decision and tumultuous excitement like an eagle cleaving the winds in the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="345" href="#">24</a> rushing swoop upon his prey.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The remembrance of this rapid and heroic episode lingers with us and gives us a sense of concealed iron behind his most feminine moods as lover and poet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Then again<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="346" href="#">25</a> at the end of the play Kalidasa skilfully strikes the same note and when we<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="347" href="#">26</a> take leave of the Ilian it is again as the King and hero whose strong arm is needed by the Gods in their approaching war with the Titans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Thus finding and leaving him as the warlike prince, we always have the impression that however great the part played by his love for Urvasie in his life, it is not the whole; that we are listening only to a love episode in some high epic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>This impression again is skilfully aided by brief but telling touches in each Act, such as the song of the Bards, for example, which remind us of the King of Kings, the toiling administrator and the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="348" href="#">27</a> great warrior; in not a single Act are these necessary strokes omitted and the art with which they are introduced naturally and as if without design is beyond praise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>But here again Kalidasa does not depart from his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="349" href="#">28</a> artistic principle of “nothing too much, nothing too little”; the purple robes of the Emperor and the bow of the hero being needed only for the background are not allowed to intrude upon the main interest, which is Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="350" href="#">29</a> the man in his native temperament.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1097"><!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>From the very first utterance that temperament reveals itself; the grandiose and confident announcement of his name and his communion with the Gods is characteristic of the epic megalomaniac; we are not deceived by his proud assumption of modesty, which he only wears as a fit outward ornament of the role he is playing on the world’s stage, part of the conventional drapery of the heroic king.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>“For modesty was ever valour’s crown.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Through this drapery we see the man glorying in himself as a poet might glory in some great creation and when madness has removed all conventional disguise, his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="351" href="#">30</a> temper breaks out with the most splendid frankness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>We see his mind empurpled with </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 202</p>
<p class="PE"> the consciousness of his worldwide fame, “This is too much; it is not possible he should not know me”; of his marvellous birth “the grandson to the Sun and Moon”; of his matchless achievements as “the chariot-warrior, great Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="352" href="#">31</a>”; of his mighty empire, “the universal sceptre of the world and sovran footstool touched by jewelled heads of tributary monarchs”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>The glory of this triple purple in which he has wrapped himself, matchless valour, matchless fame, matchless empire, dominates his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="353" href="#">32</a> imagination, and he speaks in the proud brief language of the hero but with an evident consciousness of their fine suitability to the part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>We seem to see Napoleon robing himself in the dramatic splendour of his despatches and proclamations or Alexander dragging Batis at his chariot wheels in order that he may feel himself to be Achilles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>Shall we accuse these men as some do of being liars, theatrical braggarts, inhuman madmen, mountebanks?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Let us not so in our feeble envy spit our venom on these mighty souls to half whose heights we could never rise even if we have no opportunity given us of sinking to their depths!<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>Surely no king before or after, not even Richard II, had such a royal gift of language as this grandson of the Sun and Moon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>It is peculiar to him in the play.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>Others, especially those who habitually move near him, Manavaca<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="354" href="#">33</a>, the Chamberlain, the Huntsman, the Charioteer, catch something at times of his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="355" href="#">34</a> enthusiastic poetry, but their diction is usually simple and unpretending and when it is most ambitious pale<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="356" href="#">35</a> to the colour, energy and imaginativeness which floods all his utterance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>For example in the scene of the vulture how he catches fire from a single trope of the Huntsman’s and his imagination continues coruscating and flashing over the jewel until it has vanished from sight.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>I have said that his imagination has become empurpled; but the tendency is really inborn in him; he sees, thinks and speaks in purple.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>Not only is his mind stored with pictures which break out in the most splendid tropes and similes, but he cannot see any natural object or feel any simplest </p>

<p class="PE"> emotion without bathing it in the brilliant tones of his imagination and expressing it in regal poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_73"><!-- --></a>He has also the poet’s close and inspired observation, the poet’s visualising<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="357" href="#">36</a> power, the poet’s sensuousness and aim at the concrete.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>Little things that he has seen in Nature, a portion of the bank of a river collapsing into the current, the rapid brightening<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="358" href="#">37</a> of a dark night by the moon, fire at night breaking its way through a volume of smoke, a lotus reddening in early sunlight, a wild swan flying through the sky with a lotus fibre in his beak, remain with his inner eye and at a touch burst out in poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>So inveterate is this habit of seizing on every situation and emotion and turning it into a poem, that even when he affects a feeling as in his flattery of the queen, he takes fire and acts his part with a glory and fervour of speech which make the feigned emotion momentarily genuine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>Thus with a mind stored and brimming with poetry, a habit of speech of royal splendour and fulness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="359" href="#">38</a> and an imagination fired and enlarged by the unequalled grandeur of his own destiny, Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="360" href="#">39</a> comes to the great event which shall be the touchstone of his nature.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>Then must his soul wander through all Nature seeking her, imagining her or hints and tokens of her in everything he meets, but<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="366" href="#">45</a> never grasping unless by some good chance he accept the Jewel Union born from the crimson on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="367" href="#">46</a> the marvellous feet of Himaloy’s Child, Uma, daughter of the mountains, the Mighty Mother, She who is the Soul behind Nature.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_98"><!-- --></a>The whole essential temperament of the man comes whirling out in a gyrating pomp of tropes, fancies, conceits, quick and changing emotions; everything in existence he gifts with his own mind, speech, feelings and thus moves through the pageantry of Nature draping it in the regal mantle of his imagination until the whole world exists only to be the scene and witness of his sorrow.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_101"><!-- --></a>When he first rushes in he is in the very height and tumult of it mistaking the cloud for a Titan who carries off his Urvasie and threatening him with a clod of earth which he imagines to be a deadly weapon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_102"><!-- --></a>But he is not really mad; the next moment he realises his hallucination, and the reaction produces a certain calming down of the fever; yet his mind is still working tumultuously and as he<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="378" href="#">57</a> ranges through the forest, every object is converted for a moment into a sign of Urvasie and the megalomaniac in him bursts out into the most splendid flights of self-magnification.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_103"><!-- --></a>But each fresh disappointment brings a reaction that sobers him just a little more; he turns from the inanimate objects of nature to the bee in the flower, then to the birds, then to the beasts; he gifts them with a voice, with articulate words, with thoughts lent out of the inexhaustible treasury of his teeming imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_104"><!-- --></a>Next he appeals to the God of the mountain and fancies the Echo to be his answer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_105"><!-- --></a>Mark that now for the first time it is a real articulate voice that he hears, though but the reflection of his own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_106"><!-- --></a>Immediately<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="379" href="#">58</a> afterwards his mind coming nearer and nearer to sanity, hits upon something very close to the truth; he realises that a divine force may have transformed her to some object of nature and at first by a natural misapprehension imagines that it must be the river which has the appearance Urvasie wore when she fled from him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_107"><!-- --></a>Then reason as it returns tells him that if he wishes to find her, it must be nearer the place where she disappeared.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_108"><!-- --></a>As he hurries back, he appeals for the last time to an animal to speak to him, but does not lend him a voice or words; again also he sees tokens of her in flower and tree, but they are no longer hallucinations but real or at least possible tokens.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_109"><!-- --></a>He touches the Jewel Union and hears the actual voice of the sage; he is now perfectly restored to his normal state of mind and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="380" href="#">59</a> when he embraces the creeper, it is not as Urvasie but as an “imitatress of my beloved”.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_114"><!-- --></a>I have spoken of his self-magnification and touches of megalomania.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_115"><!-- --></a>There is besides this a singular incompetence or paralysis of activity in occasional emergencies which, as I have before suggested, often overtakes the poetic temperament in action even in its most capable possessors.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_118"><!-- --></a>We feel certain that Agnimitra when rushing out of his tent would have caught up his bow and arrows and and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="384" href="#">63</a> shot the thief on the spot; Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="385" href="#">64</a> occupies time<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="386" href="#">65</a> in pouring out splendid tropes and similes over the bird and the jewel and appeals helplessly to Manavaca<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="387" href="#">66</a> for advice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_119"><!-- --></a>This is characteristic of the poetic temperament whose mind has long trained itself to throw out its imagination to meet every new object or situation and not its acting faculties; except in natures of a very firm balance the habit must lead to paralysis of the will.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_125"><!-- --></a>He exhibits deference and a show of love to Aushinarie because he “owes” her respect and affection, but in spite of his glowing language and fine acting we feel that he cherishes towards her none of the genuine respect and affection or of the real and indulgent kindliness Agnimitra feels for Dharinie and Iravatie.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_126"><!-- --></a>In the last Act he expresses some fear that he may lose religious calm; one feels that religious calm in Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="391" href="#">70</a> must have been something like the King’s robe in Hans Andersen’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="392" href="#">71</a> story.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Shelley’s Witch of Atlas and Keats’ Cynthia are certainly lovely creations, but they do not live; misty, shimmering, uncertain beings seen<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="425" href="#">1</a> in some half dream when<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="426" href="#">2</a> the moon is full and strange indefinable figures<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="427" href="#">3</a> begin to come out from the skirts of the forest, they charm our imagination but our hearts take no interest in them.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The Hindu has been always decried as a dreamer and mystic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>There is truth in the charge but also a singular inaccuracy.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But to make<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="437" href="#">13</a> the objects of<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="438" href="#">14</a> this world concrete, to realise<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="439" href="#">15</a> the things that are 
visited by sun and rain or are, at their most ethereal, sublimated figures of 
fine matter, that is comparatively easy, but the Hindu is not contented till he 
has seized things <i>behind</i> the sunlight also as concrete realities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>He is passionate for the infinite, the unseen, the spiritual, but he will not rest satisfied with conceiving them, he insists on mapping the infinite, on seeing the unseen, on visualising the spiritual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Celt throws his imagination into the infinite and is rewarded with beautiful phantoms out of which he evolves a pale, mystic and intangible poetry; the Hindu sends his heart and his intellect and eventually his whole being after his imagination and for his reward he has seen God and interpreted existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It is this double aspect of Hindu temperament, extreme spirituality successfully attempting to work in harmony 
with extreme materialism, which is the secret of our religion, our life and our 
literature, our civilisation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="440" href="#">16</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>On the one side we spiritualise the material out of all but a phenomenal and illusory existence, on the other we materialise the spiritual in the most definite and realistic forms; this is the secret of the high philosophic idealism which to the less capable European mind seems<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="441" href="#">17</a> so impossible an intellectual atmosphere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="442" href="#">18</a> and of the prolific idolatry which to the dogmatic and formalising Christian reason seems<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="443" href="#">19</a> so gross.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>In the myriad minded and undogmatic Hindu it worked not towards<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="447" href="#">23</a> mental division but as the first discord which prepares for a consistent harmony; the best and most characteristic Hindu thought regards either tendency as essential to the perfect and subtle comprehension of existence; they are considered the positive and negative sides of one truth, and must both be grasped if we are not to rest in a half light.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Hence the entire tolerance of the Hindu religion to all intellectual attitudes except sheer libertinism; hence also the marvellous perfection of graded<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="448" href="#">24</a> thought-attitudes in which<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="449" href="#">25</a> the Hindu mind travels between the sheer negative and the sheer positive and yet sees in them only a ladder of progressive and closely related steps rising through relative conceptions to one final and absolute knowledge.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>There is therefore no considerable poet in Sanscrit who has not the twofold impression, (spiritual and romantic in aim, our poetry is realistic in method), who does not keep his feet on the ground even while his eyes are with the clouds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The soaring lark who loses himself in light, the ineffectual angel beating his luminous wings in the void are not denizens of the Hindu plane of temperament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Hence the expectant critic will search ancient Hindu literature in vain for the poetry of mysticism; that is only to be found in recent Bengali poetry which has felt the influence of English models.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The old Sanscrit poetry was never satisfied unless it could show colour, energy and definiteness, and these are things incompatible with true mysticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Even the Upanishads which declare the phenomenal world to be unreal, yet have a rigidly practical aim and labour in every line to make the indefinite definite and the abstract concrete.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> our fellow creatures human, animal or inanimate have become suddenly more beautiful and dear to us than they were before; the heart flows out towards birds and beasts and the very trees seem to be drawing us towards them with their branches as if with arms; the vain cloud and the senseless mountain are no longer senseless or empty, but friendly intelligences that have a voice to our souls.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Our own common thoughts, feelings and passions have also become suddenly fair to us; they have received the sanction of beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>And then through the passion of delight and the sense of life and of love in all beautiful objects we reach to the Mighty Spirit behind them whom our soul recognizes no longer as an object of knowledge or of worship but as her lover, to whom she must fly, leaving her husband the material life and braving the jeers and reprobation of the world for His sake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Thus by a singular paradox, one of those beautiful oxymorons of which the Hindu temperament is full, we reach God through the senses, just as our ancestors did through the intellect and through the emotions; for in the Hindu mind all roads lead eventually to the Rome of its longing, the dwelling of the Most High God.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The original meaning is everywhere felt as a shining background, but most in the older allegories, especially the strange and romantic legend of Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="475" href="#">51</a> as we first have it in the Brahmanas and the Vishnupurana<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="476" href="#">52</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The class of Hetairae was as recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="477" href="#">53</a> an element in Hindu<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="478" href="#">54</a> society as in Greek<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="479" href="#">55</a>, but it does not appear to have exercised quite so large an influence on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="480" href="#">56</a> social life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>As in the Greek counterpart they were a specially learned and accomplished class of women, but their superiority over ladies of good families was not so pronounced; for in ancient India previous to the Mahomedan episode respectable women were not mere ignorant housewives like the Athenian ladies, they were<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="481" href="#">57</a> educated though not in a formal manner; that is to say they went through no systematic training such as men had but parents were always expected to impart general culture and accomplishments to them by private tuition at home; singing, music, dancing and to some extent painting were the ordinary accomplishments, general knowledge of morality, Scripture and tradition<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="482" href="#">58</a> was imperative, and sometimes the girls of highborn, wealthy or learned families received special instruction in philosophy or mathematics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Some indeed seem to have pursued a life of philosophic learning either as virgins or widows; but such instances were in preBuddhistic times very rare; the normal Hindu feeling has always been that the sphere of woman is in the home and her life incomplete unless merged in her husband’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>In any case the majority of the kulabadhus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="483" href="#">59</a>, women of respectable families, could hardly </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 218</p>
<p class="PE"> be more than amateurs in the arts and sciences, whereas with the Hetairae (Gunicas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="484" href="#">60</a>) such accomplishments were pursued and mastered as a profession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Hence beside their ordinary occupation of singing and dancing in the temples and on great public occasions such as coronations and holy days, they often commanded the irregular affections of highborn or wealthy men who led openly a double life at home with the wife, outside with the Hetaira.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>As a class, they held no mean place in society; for they must not be confused with the strolling actor or mountebank caste who were a proverb for their vileness of morals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Many of them, no doubt, as will inevitably happen when the restraints of society are not recognized, led loose, immoral and sensual lives; in such a class Lais and Phryne must be as common as Aspasia.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless the higher and intellectual element seems to have prevailed; those who arrogated freedom in their sexual relations but were not prostitutes, are admirably portrayed in Vasuntséna<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="485" href="#">61</a> of the <i>Toy Cart</i>, a beautiful melodrama drawn straight from the life; like her they often exchanged, with the consent of their lover’s family, the unveiled face of the Hetaira for the seclusion of the wife.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Now vital and sensational charm in seeking its fulfilment demands that the pursuit of sensuous beauty shall be its sole object, that it shall be without check as without any sideglance or afterthought; it does not seek to be immoral, but simply rejects all moral tests; it recognizes no law but the fulfilment of its own being.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>This is the very spirit of the Hetaira.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The beauty of nakedness sculptured, painted or shaped into words, is not immoral; but the moment we apply the test of morality, it becomes clear that we must either rule it out as not belonging to the world of morality, or rule out morality itself for the moment as not belonging to the world of beauty, which is essentially a world of nakedness in the sense that dress there is an occasional ornament, not a necessary covering — not because there is any essential opposition between them but because there is no essential connection or necessary point of contact.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Indra is the universal cosmic energy limited in the terrestrial forces of conservation; like all active and conservative forces he distrusts the contemplative spirit of philosophy because it is disruptive and tends to cast thought and therefore life into solution towards the creation of fresh forms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Thus he is besieged by a double anxiety; on one side the spirits entrusted with the work of destruction and anarchy are ever endeavouring to seat themselves in the place of Indra, the high conserving force, on the other he dreads to be dethroned by some embodiment of the contemplative spirit, examining, analysing, synthetising new forms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>His method of defence against the former is usually though by no means invariably open warfare, against the latter sensuous seduction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>He tempts the mind of the philosopher to sacrifice that aloofness from ordinary sensuous life and its average delights on which his perfect effectiveness depends; or if he cannot succeed in this, to move him to an angry and abhorrent recoil from sensuousness which is equally fatal to complete philosophic efficiency.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1153"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Of these outward brilliances Kalidasa’s conception of Urvasie is entirely void.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>His presentation of her is simply that of a beautiful and radiant woman deeply in love.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Certainly the glories of her skiey residence, the far-off luminousness and the free breath of the winds are about her, but they are her atmosphere rather than part of herself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The essential idea of her is a natural<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="510" href="#">3</a>, frank and charming womanliness; timidity, a quick temper, a harmless petulance and engaging childishness afterwards giving way to a matronly sedateness and bloom, swift, innocent and frank passion, warm affections as mother, sister and friend, speech </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 223</p>
<p class="PE"> always straight from the heart, the precise elements in fact that give their greatest charm to ideal girlhood and womanhood are the main tones that compose her<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="511" href="#">4</a> picture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>There is nothing here of the stately pace and formal dignity of the goddess, no cothurnus raising her above human stature, no mask petrifying the simple and natural play of the feelings, the smile in the eyes, the ready tears, the sweetness of the mouth, the lowered lashes, the quick and easy gesture full of spontaneous charm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>If this is a nymph of heaven, one thinks, then heaven must be beautifully like the earth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Her terror and collapse in the episode of her<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="512" href="#">5</a> abduction and rescue, where Chitraleqha manages pretty successfully to keep up her courage as a goddess should, is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="513" href="#">6</a> certainly not Opsaralike<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="514" href="#">7</a> — Chitraleqha with sisterly impatience expresses her sense of that, “Fie, sweet! thou art no Opsara<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="515" href="#">8</a>” — but it is nevertheless attractively human and seizes our sympathies for her from the outset.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Still<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="516" href="#">9</a> more engaging is her timidity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>There is also a sensitiveness in her love, a quickness to take alarm and despond which makes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="517" href="#">10</a> her very human.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>If this is jealousy, it is a quick and generous jealousy having nothing in it of “jealous baseness”, but rather born of a panic of timidity and an extreme 
diffidence and ignorance of the power of her own beauty<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="518" href="#">11</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>This detail is very carefully observed and emphasized as if Kalidasa wished to take especial pains to prevent even the most hidebound commentator from reading in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="519" href="#">12</a> her character any touch of the heavenly courtesan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The ostentatious<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="520" href="#">13</a> splendours, the conscious allurements of the courtesan are not here<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="521" href="#">14</a>, but rather a divine simplicity and white candour of soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It is from an innate purity and openness that the frankness and impulsiveness of her love proceeds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Incapable of disguise, hastily open, even<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="522" href="#">15</a> tremulously playful at times, she is easily dashed in her advances and quick to distrust her own merit<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="523" href="#">16</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>There<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="524" href="#">17</a> are few more graceful touches in lighter love-drama than her hasty appearance, unconsciously invisible, before Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="525" href="#">18</a>, and her panic of dismay when he takes no notice of her.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>In the same scene, her half playful, half serious self-justification on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="526" href="#">19</a> embracing her lover and her immediate abashed silence at his retort, portray admirably the mixture of frank impulsiveness and shy timidity proper to her character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>These <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> are the little magic half-noticeable touches of which Kalidasian characterisation is mainly composed, the hundred significant trifles which Kalidasa’s refined taste in life felt to be the essence of character in action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>A shade of wilfulness, the occasional childlike petulance, the delighted abandonment of herself to her passion, which are part of her charm, proceed also from the same surface lightness and quickness of a deep and strong nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>With<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="527" href="#">20</a> all this she can be very sweet and noble too, even dignified as in a few utterances of the Third Act, her reunion with Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="528" href="#">21</a> in the fourth and all through the fifth where she is wife and mother and while losing the girlishness, petulance and playfulness of the earlier scenes has greatly deepened her charm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>I see nothing of the heavenly courtesan which some over-precise commentators insist on finding in her; within the four corners of the play, which is all Kalidasa allows us to consider, she is wholly delightful, innocent, even modest, at any rate not immodest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Certainly she is more frank and playful in her love than Shacountala or even Malavica could venture to be, but something must be allowed to a goddess and her demeanour is too much flavoured with timidity, her advances too easily dashed to give any disagreeable impression of forwardness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Urvasie’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="529" href="#">22</a> finest characteristic, however, is her sincerity in passion and affection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The poet has taken great pains to discharge her utterance of all appearance of splendour, ornament and superfluity; her simple, direct and earnest diction is at the opposite pole to the gorgeous imaginativeness of the Ilian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>And while her manner of speech is always simple and ordinary, what she says is exactly the unstudied and obvious thing that a woman of no great parts, but natural and quick in her affections would spontaneously say under the circumstances; it is even surprisingly natural.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>For example when she sees Ayus fondled by Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="530" href="#">23</a>, “Who is this youth” she asks with the little inevitable undertone of half-jealousy “Himself my monarch binds his hair<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="531" href="#">24</a> into a crest!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Who should this be so highly favoured”; and then she notices Satyavatie and understands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But there is no poetical<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="532" href="#">25</a> outburst of maternal joy and passion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>“It is my Ayus!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a><i>How he has grown</i>!”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>That is all; and nothing could be better or truer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Yet for all the surface colourlessness there is a charm in <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> everything Urvasie says, the charm of absolute sincerity and direct unaffected feeling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Her passion for Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="533" href="#">26</a> is wonderfully genuine and fine from her first cry of “O Titans!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>You did me kindness!” to her last of “O a sword is taken Out of my heart!”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Whatever the mood its speech has always a tender force and reality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Her talk<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="534" href="#">27</a> with Chitraleqha and the other Opsaras<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="535" href="#">28</a> from the outburst “O sisters, sisters, take me to your bosoms” to her farewell “Chitraleqha, my sister! do not forget me”, is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="536" href="#">29</a> instinct, when moved, with “a passion of sisterliness” and at other times, bright and limpid in its<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="537" href="#">30</a> fair kindness and confidence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>To her son she comes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="538" href="#">31</a> “with her whole rapt gaze Grown mother, the veiled bosom heaving towards him And wet with sacred milk.” and her farewell to the Hermitess sets a model for the expression of genuine and tender friendship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Urvasie is doubtless not so noble and strong a portraiture as Shacountala, but she is inferior to no heroine of Sanscrit drama in beauty and sweetness of womanly nature.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 230</p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Children do pose and children do sentimentalise, but they are perfectly naive and unconscious about it; they pose with sincerity, they sentimentalise with a sort of passionate simplicity, indeed an earnest businesslikeness which is so sincere that it does not even require an audience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The greatest minds have their limitations and Shakespeare’s over-abounding wit shut<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="577" href="#">2</a> him out from two Paradises, the mind of a child and the heart of a mother.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Constance, the pathetic mother, is a fitting pendant to Arthur, the pathetic child, as insincere and falsely drawn a portraiture, as obviously dressed up for the part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Indeed throughout the meagre and mostly unsympathetic list of mothers in Shakespeare’s otherwise various and splendid gallery there is not even one in whose speech there is the throbbing of a mother’s heart; the sacred beauty of maternity is touched upon in a phrase or two; but from Shakespeare we expect something more, some perfect and passionate enshrining of the most engrossing and selfless of human affections.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>I have already spoken of the progressive attenuation of the traditional buffoon part which keeps pace with Kalidasa’s dramatic development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Gautama in the Malavica is a complete and living personality who has much to say to the action of the plot; witty, mischievous, mendacious and irresponsible </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 233</p>
<p class="PE"> he adds to the interest of the play even independently of this functional importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But in the Urvasie to have made the main action of the plot turn in any way on the buffoon would have been incongruous with the high romantic beauty of the drama and therefore a serious dramatic error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The function of Manavaca is accordingly reduced to that of an interlocutor; he is there because Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="596" href="#">1</a> must have somebody to confide in and talk with, otherwise his only dramatic purpose is to give rise by his carelessness to the episode of Aushinarie’s jealousy and self-subdual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless his presence affects the composite tone of the picture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>He is other than the buffoons of the Malavica and Shacountala, far more coarse in the grain, far less talented and highspirited than Gautama, yet not a mere stupid<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="597" href="#">2</a> block like [Mandhavya]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="598" href="#">3</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>He has along with the stock characteristics of gluttony, ugliness and cowardice, an occasional coarse humour, infertile and broad, and even a real gift of commonsense and rather cynical practicality, to say nothing of that shadow of the purple flung across the speech of all those who associate habitually with Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="599" href="#">4</a>; he is at the same time low in mind, unable to understand characters higher than his own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>His best virtue is perhaps his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="600" href="#">5</a> absence of all pretensions and readiness to make a gibe of<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="601" href="#">6</a> himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Such a figure necessarily tends to set off by its drab colour and squat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="602" href="#">7</a> dimensions the lyric idealism of Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="603" href="#">8</a>, the radiant charm of Urvasie and the pale loftiness of the Queen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But it is by his place in the picture and not by what<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="604" href="#">9</a> he is in himself that he justifies his existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>He does not attract or interest, indeed he at times only just escapes being tiresome.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Queen Aushinarie has no real claim by any essentiality in her actions<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="606" href="#">11</a> to<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="607" href="#">12</a> the large space she occupies in the play; her jealousy does not retard and her renunciation sanctifies rather than assists the course of Pururavus’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="608" href="#">13</a> love for Urvasie.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The whole episode in which she figures fits more loosely into the architecture of the piece<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="609" href="#">14</a> than can be </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 234</p>
<p class="PE"> exampled elsewhere in Kalidasa’s dramatic workmanship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The interest of her personality justifies the insertion of the episode rather than the episode that justifies the not inconsiderable space devoted to her.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The motif of her appearance is the same conventional element of wifely rivalry, the jealousy of the rose-in-bloom against the rose-in-bud that has formed the whole groundwork of the Malavica.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>There the groundwork, here its interest is brief and episodical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>And yet none of the more elaborated figures in the earlier play, not even Dharinie herself, is as fine and deep a conception as the wife of Pururavus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="610" href="#">15</a>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The character is more profoundly and boldly conceived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The passion of her love strikes deeper than the mere heyday of youth and beauty and the senses in Iravatie as the noble sadness of her self-renunciation moves more powerfully than the kind and gentle wifeliness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="616" href="#">21</a> of Queen Dharinie.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>And in the manner of her delineation there is more incisiveness and restraint<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="617" href="#">22</a> with a nobler economy of touch.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The rush of her jealousy comes with less of a storm than Iravatie’s but it has a fierier<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="618" href="#">23</a> and keener edge and it is felt to be the disguise of a deep and mighty love.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It was once thought an established fact that he lived and wrote in the 6th century at the court of Harsha Vikramaditya, the Conqueror of the Scythians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>That position is now much assailed, and some would place him in the third or fourth century; others see ground to follow popular tradition in making him a contemporary of Virgil, if not of Lucretius.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1195"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The exact date matters little.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is enough that we find in Kalidasa’s poetry the richest bloom and perfect expression of the long classical afternoon of Indian civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The soul of an age is mirrored in this single mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It was an age when the Indian world after seeking God through the spirit and through action turned to seek Him through the activity of the senses, an age therefore of infinite life, colour and splendour, an age of brilliant painting and architecture, wide learning, complex culture, developing sciences; an age of great empires and luxurious courts and cities; an age, above all, in which the physical beauty and grace of woman dominated the minds and imaginations of men.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1196"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The spirit of the times pulses through all Kalidasa’s poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>His pages are often ablaze with its light and colour, often pregnant, sometimes indeed overweighted with its rich and manifold learning, its keen pleasure in every phase and aspect of life fills them with a various vividness and infinite richness of matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Language and verse thrill with the rustling of woman’s raiment, the heavy scent of her cosmetics, the tinkling and lustre of her ornaments; they are sinuous with the swaying grace of her motion or subtle with the delicate charm of her ways and words; the beauty and pleasure of her body possesses and besieges the poet’s </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 237</p>
<p class="PE"> imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>And behind the luxurious ease and sensuousness of court life we hear the clash of arms and glimpse the great and energetic motions of statesmanship and diplomacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The variety of his genius specially fits Kalidasa for the interpretation of a rich and complex national life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>From pages heavy with the obsession of the senses, the delight of the eye and the lust of the flesh we turn to others sweet and gracious with the virgin purity of the woodlands; the same poem which gives us a glowing picture of the luxurious voluptuousness of courts gives us also the sternest philosophy and the most vigorous expression of the noble, aspiring morality proper to an active and heroic age.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>His wonderful visualising power turns whole cantos into a series of almost physically vivid pictures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>All his senses are on the alert, his ear for music and the sweetness of words and laughter, thunder, the cries of birds; his sense of smell for the scent of flowers, incense, the perfumes in women’s attire, his sense of touch for every tactual pleasure, his mind for all subtlety of knowledge and all possible delicacies, richnesses, grandeurs in the world of thought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>He will miss nothing; lose no joy of sense or intellect, throw away no chance of feeling himself alive.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1197"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And he has the touch of the perfect artist, turning all he handles to gold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Among his achievements we number the most exquisite, tender and delicately lovely of romantic dramas; the most varied and splendid panorama of human life; the noblest and most grandiose epic of our classical literature; and its one matchless poem of passionate love and descriptive beauty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1198"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In Europe the Shacountala is the one poem of Kalidasa universally known and appreciated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In India the Cloud has gone even nearer home to the national imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>For this there is good reason.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>No one who has not lived the life of India, till it has become part of his breathing and woven in with every thread of his imagination, can fully appreciate the poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If one does not know the charm of its hills, the scent of its flowers, the beauty of its skies, [the] flowing sacredness of its rivers with all the phases and emotions of an Indian river’s life, if one cannot distinguish </p>

<p class="PE"> and thrill to the touch of its various winds, if one cannot clothe its local places with ancient historic and mythical association or people them with the strange host of beautiful and weird figures and faces which the imagination of its people has created, if one does not recreate for himself the ancient splendours of its cities, the sense of peace and infinity in its temples and hermitages and the simple sweetness of its rural life, for him the Meghaduta offers only its shell.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But all these, everything that is redolent of India, the visible, material, sensuous India has been fused and poured into one perfect mould by the genius of this supreme artist.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1199"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>And then as if more utterly to ensnare the imagination of his race, after showing them the beautiful scenes, sights, sounds, scents, the sacred and cherished places, the historic cities of their country as they are — or alas as they were — he lifts these cherished things into a magic world, bathes them in an immortal beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Ullaca, the city without death, is but Kalidasa’s beloved Ujjaini taken up into the clouds and transformed into a seat of ideal bliss and loveliness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>In the same moment he strikes straight home at one of the most deepseated feelings in human nature, its repining at the shortness of life and the more tragic shortness of youth, and imaginative dream of an eternal beauty, youth and joy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>These he satisfies and turns from a source of unrest into a new source of pleasure and joy, showing himself the great poet as well as the delicate artist.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The importance of metre arises from the fact that different arrangements of sound have different spiritual and emotional values, tend to produce that is to say by virtue of the fixed succession of sounds a fixed spiritual atmosphere and a given type of emotional exaltation and the mere creative power of sound though a material thing is yet near to spirit, is very great; great on the material and ascending in force through the moral and intellectual, culminating on the emotional plane.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 243</p>
<p class="PE"> arrangements of syllabic sound metre forms the most important, at least the most tangible element.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Every poet who has sounded his own consciousness must be aware that management of metre is the gate of his inspiration and the law of his success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>There is a double process, his state of mind and spirit suggesting its own syllabic measure, and the metre again confirming, prolonging and recreating the original state of mind and spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Inspiration itself seems hardly so much a matter of ideas or feeling as of rhythm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Even when the ideas or the feelings are active, they will not usually run into the right form, the words will not take their right places, the syllables will not fall into a natural harmony.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But if one has or succeeds in awaking the right metrical mood, if the metrical form instead of being deliberately created, creates itself or <i>becomes</i>, a magical felicity of thought, diction and harmony attends it and seems even to be created by it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Ideas and words come rapidly and almost as rapidly take their right places as in a well ordered assembly where everyone knows his seat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>When the metre comes right, everything else comes right; when the metre has to be created with effort, everything else has to be done with effort, and the result has to be worked on over and over again before it satisfies.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1215"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>This supreme importance of the metrical form might seem at first sight to justify the transplanters of metre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>For if it be the aim of good translation to reproduce not merely the mechanical meanings of words, the corresponding verbal counters used in the rough and ready business of interlingual commerce, but to create the same spiritual, emotional and aesthetic effect as the original, the first condition is obviously to identify our spiritual condition, as far as may be, with that of the poet at the time when he wrote and then to embody the emotion in verse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>This cannot be done without finding a metre which shall have the same spiritual and emotional value as the metre of the original.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Even when one has been found, there will naturally be no success unless the mind of the translator has sufficient kinship, sufficient points of spiritual and emotional contact and a sufficient basis of common poetical powers not only to enter into but to render the spiritual temperament and the mood of that temperament, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 244</p>
<p class="PE"> of which his text was the expression; hence a good poetical translation is the rarest thing in the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Conversely even if all these requisites exist, they will not succeed to the full without the discovery of the right metre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Is the right metre then the metre of the original?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Must an adequate version of Homer, a real <i>translation</i>, be couched in the hexameter?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>At first sight it would seem so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>But the issue is here complicated by the hard fact that the same arrangement of quantities or of accents has very seldom the same spiritual and emotional value in two different languages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The hexameter in English, however skilfully managed, has not the same value as the Homeric, the English alexandrine does not render the French; terza rima in Latinised Saxon sounds entirely different from the noble movement of the Divina Commedia, the stiff German blank verse of Goethe and Schiller is not the golden Shakespearian harmony.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>It is not only that there are mechanical differences, a strongly accentuated language hopelessly varying from those which distribute accent evenly, or a language of ultimate accent like French from one of penultimate accent like Italian or initial accent like English, or one which courts elision from one which shuns it, a million grammatical and syllabic details besides, lead to fundamental differences of sound-notation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Beyond and beneath these outward differences is the essential soul of the language from which they arise, and which in its turn depends mainly upon the ethnological type always different in different countries because the mixture of different root races in two types even when they seem nearly related is never the same.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>The Swedish type for instance which is largely the same as the Norwegian is yet largely different, while the Danish generally classed in the same Scandinavian group differs radically from both.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>This is that curse of Babel, after all quite as much a blessing as a curse, which weighs upon no one so heavily as on the conscientious translator of poetry; for the prose translator being more concerned to render the precise idea than emotional effects and the subtle spiritual aura of poetry, treads an immeasurably smoother and more straightforward path.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>For some metres at least it seems impossible to find adequate equivalents in other languages.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>It is not the whole truth to say that no modern can put himself back imaginatively into the half-savage Homeric period; a mind with a sufficient basis of primitive sympathies and sufficient power of imaginative self-control to subdue for a time the modern in him may conceivably be found.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>But the main, the insuperable obstacle is that no one has ever found or been able to create an English metre with the same spiritual and emotional equivalent as Homer’s marvellous hexameters.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1216"><!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>That transmetrisation is a false method, is therefore clear.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>The translator’s only resource is to steep himself in the original, quelling that in him which conflicts with its spirit, and remain on the watch for the proper metrical mood in himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Sometimes the right metre will come to him, sometimes it will not.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>In the latter case effort in this direction will not have been entirely wasted; for spirit, when one gives it a chance, is always stronger than matter and he will be able to impose something of the desired spiritual atmosphere even upon an unsuitable metrical form.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>But if he seize on the right metre, he has every chance, supposing him poetically empowered, of creating a translation which shall not only be classical, but shall be <i>the</i> translation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Wilful choice of metre is always fatal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>William Morris’ Homeric translation failed hopelessly partly because of his affected “Anglosaxon” diction, but still more because he chose to apply a metre good enough possibly for the Volsungasaga to the rendering of a far more mighty and complex spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>On the other hand Fitzgerald might have produced a very beautiful version in English had he chosen for his Rubaiyat some ordinary English metre, but his unique success was his reward for discovering the true equivalent of the quatrain in English.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>One need only imagine to oneself the difference if Fitzgerald had chosen the ordinary English quatrain instead of the rhyme system of his original.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>His Rubaiyat in spite of the serious defect of unfaithfulness will remain the final version of Omar in English, not to be superseded by more faithful renderings, excluding therefore the contingency of a superior poetical genius employing the same metre for a fuller and closer translation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1217"><!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>In 
Kalidasa another very serious difficulty over and beyond  
the usual pitfalls meets the unhappy translator<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="641" href="#">2</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>Few great Sanscrit poems employ the same metre throughout.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>In the dramas where metrical form is only used when the thought, image or emotion rises above the ordinary level, the poet employs whatever metre he thinks suitable to the mood he is in.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_73"><!-- --></a>In English however such a method would result in opera rather than in drama.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>I have therefore thought it best, taking into consideration the poetical feeling and harmonious flow of Kalidasa’s prose, to use blank verse throughout varying its pitch according as the original form is metrical or prose and the emotion or imagery more or less exalted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>In epic work the licence of metrical variation is not quite so great; yet there are several metres considered apt to epic narrative and Kalidasa varies them without scruple in different cantos, sometimes even in the same canto.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>If blank verse be, as I believe it is, a fair equivalent for the anustubh, the ordinary epic metre, how shall one find others which shall correspond as well to the “Indra’s thunderbolt sloka”, the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="642" href="#">3</a> “lesser Indra’s thunderbolt sloka<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="643" href="#">4</a>”, the “gambolling of the tiger sloka”<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="644" href="#">5</a> and all those other wonderful and grandiose rhythmic structures with fascinating names of which Kalidasa is so mighty a master?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_77"><!-- --></a>Nor would such variation be tolerated by English canons of taste.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_78"><!-- --></a>In the epic and drama the translator is driven to a compromise and therefore to that extent a failure; he may infuse good poems or plays reproducing the architecture and idea-sense of Kalidasa with something of his spirit; but it is a version and not a translation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_79"><!-- --></a>It is only when he comes to the Cloud Messenger that he is free of this difficulty; for the Cloud Messenger is written throughout in a single and consistent stanza.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>Fortunately by an inspiration, and without deliberate choice, Kalidasa’s lines as I began turning them flowed or slipped into<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="648" href="#">9</a> the form of triple rhyme and that necessarily suggested the terza rima.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_85"><!-- --></a>This metre, as I have treated it, seems to me to reproduce with as much accuracy as the difference between the languages allows, the spiritual and emotional atmosphere of the Cloud Messenger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_86"><!-- --></a>The terza rima in English lends itself naturally to the principle of variation in recurrence, which imparts so singular a charm to this poem, recurrence in especial of certain words, images, assonances, harmonies, but recurrence always with a difference so as to keep one note sounding through the whole performance underneath its various harmony.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_87"><!-- --></a>In terza rima the triple rhyme immensely helps this effect, for it allows of the same common rhymes recurring but usually with a difference in one or more of their company.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_89"><!-- --></a>This seems to me a fallacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_90"><!-- --></a>Any metre capable of accentual representation in harmony with the accentual law of the English language, can be naturalised in English.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_92"><!-- --></a>Byron and Shelley failed because they wanted to create the same effect with this instrument as Dante had done; but terza rima in English can never have the same effect as in Italian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_93"><!-- --></a>In the one it is a metre of woven harmonies suitable to noble and intellectual narrative; in the other it can only be a metre of woven melodies suitable to beautiful description or elegiac sweetness.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_97"><!-- --></a>His lyric metres and within certain limitations his blank verse are always fine, so fine that if the matter and manner were equal to the melody, he would have been one of the few great poets instead of one of the many who have just missed being great.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1224"><!--SENT--><a name="s_100"><!-- --></a>The second question, but a far simpler one, is the use of rhyme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_101"><!-- --></a>It may be objected that as in the Sanscrit there is no rhyme, the introduction of this element into the English version would disturb the closeness of the spiritual equivalent by the intrusion of a foreign ornament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_102"><!-- --></a>But this is to argue from a quantitative to an accentual language, which is always a mistake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_103"><!-- --></a>There are certain effects easily created within the rich quantitative variety of ancient languages, of which an equivalent in English can only be found by the aid of rhyme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_104"><!-- --></a>No competent critic would declare Tennyson’s absurd experiment in Boadicea an equivalent to the rushing, stumbling and leaping metre of the Attis with its singular and rare effects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_105"><!-- --></a>A proper equivalent would only be found in some rhymed system and preferably I should fancy in some system of unusually related but intricate and closely recurring rhymes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_106"><!-- --></a>Swinburne might have done it; for Swinburne’s work, though with few exceptions poor work as poetry, is a marvellous repertory of successful metrical experiments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_107"><!-- --></a>I have already indicated the appropriateness of the triple rhyme system of the terza rima to the Cloud Messenger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_108"><!-- --></a>English is certainly not a language of easy rhyming like the southern tongues of Europe; but given in the poet a copious command of words and a natural swing and felicity, <i>laeta</i> rather than <i>curiosa</i>, it is amply enough provided for any ordinary call upon its resources.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_109"><!-- --></a>There are however two critical superstitions which seriously interfere with the naturalness and ease rhymed poetry </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 249</p>
<p class="PE"> demands, the superstition of the perfect rhyme and the superstition of the original rhyme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_110"><!-- --></a>It is no objection to a rhyme that it is imperfect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_111"><!-- --></a>There is nothing occult or cryptic in rhyme, no divine law compelling us to assimilate two rhymed endings to the very letter such as the law of the Védic chant by which a single letter mispronounced sterilizes the mantra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_112"><!-- --></a>Rhyme is a convenience and an ornament intended to serve certain artistic purposes, to create certain sound-effects, and if the effect of a perfect rhyme is beautiful, melodious and satisfying, an imperfect rhyme has sometimes its own finer effect far more subtle, haunting and suggestive; by limiting the satisfaction of the ear, it sets a new chord vibrating in the soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_113"><!-- --></a>A poem with an excessive proportion of imperfect rhymes is unsatisfactory, because it would not satisfy the natural human craving for regularity and order; but the slavish use of perfect rhymes only would be still more inartistic because it would not satisfy the natural human craving for liberty and variety.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_114"><!-- --></a>In this respect and in a hundred others the disabilities of the English language have been its blessings; the artistic labour and the opportunity for calling a subtler harmony out of discord have given its best poetical literature a force and power quite out of proportion to the natural abilities of the race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_115"><!-- --></a>There are of course limits to every departure from rigidity but the degree of imperfection admissible in a rhyme is very great so long as it does not evolve harshness or vulgarism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_116"><!-- --></a>Mrs. Browning’s rhymes are bad in this respect, but why?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_117"><!-- --></a>Because “tyrants” and “silence” is no rhyme at all, while “candles” and “angels” involves a hideous vulgarism; and in less glaring instances the law of double rhymes generally requiring closer correspondence than single is totally disregarded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_118"><!-- --></a>The right use of imperfect rhymes is not to be forbidden because of occasional abuse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_119"><!-- --></a>It is also no objection to a rhyme that it is “hackneyed”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_120"><!-- --></a>A hackneyed thought, a hackneyed phrase there may be, but a hackneyed rhyme seems to me a contradiction in terms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_121"><!-- --></a>Rhyme is no part of the intellectual warp and woof of a poem, but a pure ornament the only object of which is to assist the soul with beauty; it appeals to the soul not through the intellect or imagination but through the ear.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_123"><!-- --></a>Common rhymes have a wonderful charm of their own and come to us laden with a thousand beautiful associations.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_125"><!-- --></a>Such rhymes any poet can multiply who chooses to prostitute his genius to the amusement of the gallery, or is sufficiently unpoetic to prefer the freedom of barbarous uncouthness to that self-denial which is the secret of grace and beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_126"><!-- --></a>On the other hand if we pursue originality and beauty together, we end in preciosity or an artificial grace, and what are these but the spirit of Poetry lifting her wings to abandon that land and that literature for a long season or sometimes for ever?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_127"><!-- --></a>Unusual and peculiar rhymes demand to be sparingly used and always for the definite object of setting in relief common rhymes rather than for the sake of their own strangeness.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1225"><!--SENT--><a name="s_128"><!-- --></a>The question of metre and rhymes being satisfactorily settled there comes the crucial question of fidelity, on which every translator has to make his own choice at his own peril.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_129"><!-- --></a>On one side is the danger of sacrificing the spirit to the letter, on the other the charge of writing a paraphrase or a poem of one’s own under the cloak of translation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_130"><!-- --></a>Here as elsewhere it seems to me that rigid rules are out of place.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_132"><!-- --></a>If we merely want to render, to acquaint foreign peoples with the ideas and subject matter of the writer, as literal a rendering as idiom will allow, will do our business.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_133"><!-- --></a>If we wish to give a poetical version, to clothe the general sense and spirit of the writer in our own words, paraphrase and unfaithfulness become permissible; the writer has not intended to translate and it is idle to criticise him with reference to an ideal he never entertained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_134"><!-- --></a>But the ideal of a translation is something different from either of these.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_135"><!-- --></a>The translator seeks first to place the mind of the reader in the same spiritual atmosphere as the original; he seeks next to produce in him the same emotions and the same kind of poetical delight and aesthetic gratification, and lastly he seeks to convey to him the thought of the poet and substance in such words as will create, </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_137"><!-- --></a>How it shall be done, depends upon the judgment, the sympathetic instinct of the poet, the extent to which he is imbued with the associations of both languages and can render not merely word by word but shade by shade, not only signification by signification, but suggestion by suggestion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_138"><!-- --></a>There is one initial stumbling block which can never be quite got over; the mythology, fauna and flora of Indian literature are absolutely alien to Europe.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> the problem and content oneself with tumbling out the warm, throbbing Indian word to shiver and starve in the inclement atmosphere of the English language seems to me not only an act of literary inhumanity and a poorspirited confession of failure, but a piece of laziness likely to defeat its own object.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The cultured may read their work in spite of the jargon out of the unlimited intellectual curiosity natural to culture; the half-cultured may read it because of the jargon out of the ingrained tendency of the half-cultured mind to delight in what is at once unintelligible and inartistic.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In the first place a certain concession may be made but within very narrow and guarded limits to the need for local colour; a few names of trees, flowers, birds etc. may be transliterated into English, but only when they do not look hopelessly outlandish in that form or else have a liquid or haunting beauty of sound; a similar indulgence may be yet more freely permitted in the transliteration of mythological names.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>This may be done in many ways and I have availed myself of all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>A word may be rendered by some neologism which will help to convey any prominent characteristic or idea associated with the thing it expresses; blossom o’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="652" href="#">2</a> ruby may, for instance, render bandhoula, a flower which is always mentioned for its redness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Or else the word itself may be dropped and the characteristic brought into prominence; for instance instead of saying that a woman is lipped like a ripe bimba, it is, I think, a fair translation to write “Her scarlet mouth is a ripe fruit and red.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>This device of expressingly declaring the 
characteristics which the original only mentions, I have frequently employed in 
the Cloud Messenger, even when equivalent words exist in English, because many

associated or only with one particular and often accidental characteristic.
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>A kindred method especially with mythological allusions is to explain fully what in the original is implicit; Kalidasa for instance compares a huge dark cloud striding northwards from Crouncharundhra to “the dark foot of Vishnu<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="653" href="#">3</a> lifted in impetuous act to quell Bali”, <span class="devan">śyāmaḥ pādo baliniyamanābhyudyatasyeva viṣṇoḥ</span>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But there still remains the question, whether while preserving the ideals one may not still adhere more or less closely to the text.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The answer to this is that such closeness is imperative, but it must be a closeness of word-value, not merely<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="673" href="#">23</a> of word-meaning; into this word-value there enter the elements of association, sound and aesthetic beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>If these are not translated, the word is not translated, however correct the rendering may be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>For instance the words <span class="devan">salila</span>, <span class="devan">āpaḥ</span> and <span class="devan">jala</span> in Sanscrit all mean water, but if <span class="devan">jala</span> may be fairly represented by the common English word and the more poetic <span class="devan">āpaḥ</span> by “waters” or “ocean” according to the context, what will represent the beautiful suggestions of grace, brightness, softness and clearness which accompany <span class="devan">salila</span>?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Here it is obvious that we have to seek refuge in sound suggestions and verse-subtleties to do what is not feasible by verbal rendering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Everything therefore depends on the skill and felicity of the translator and he must be judged rather by the accuracy with which he renders the emotional and aesthetic value of each expression than brought to a rigid [accounting<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="674" href="#">24</a> ] for each word in the original.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Moreover the idiom of Sanscrit, especially of classical Sanscrit, is too far divided from the idiom of English.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Literal translation from the Greek is possible though sometimes disastrous, but literal translation from the Sanscrit is impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>There is indeed a school endowed with more valour than discretion and more metaphor than sense who condemn the dressing up of the Aryan beauty in English clothes and therefore demand that not only should the exact words be kept, but the exact idiom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>For instance they would perpetrate the following: “Covering with lashes water-heavy from anguish, her eye gone to meet from former pleasantness the nectar-cool lattice-path-entered feet of </p>

<p class="PE"> the moon and then at once turned away, like a land-lotus-plant on a cloudy day not awake, not sleeping.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>Now quite apart from the execrable English and the want of rhythm, the succession of the actions and the connexions of thought which are made admirably clear in the Sanscrit by the mere order of the words, is here entirely obscured and lost; moreover the poetic significance of the words <span class="devan">prītyā</span> (pleasantness) and sābhre<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="675" href="#">25</a>, implying here rain as well as cloud and the beautiful force of <span class="devan">salilagurubhiḥ</span> (water-heavy) are not even hinted at; while the meaning and application of the simile quite apparent in the original needs bringing out in the English.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The most famous ballads, those which never perish, have been written by such thwarted geniuses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Although the influence of romanticism has made it a literary fashion to couple these ballads with Homer, yet in truth balladwriting is the lowest form of the poetical art; its method is entirely sensational.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The impact of outward facts on the body is carried through the vital principle, the sensational element in man, to the mind, and mind obediently answers the knocking outside, photographs the impression with force and definiteness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>But there has been no exercise of the higher faculty of understanding, considering, choosing, moulding what it receives.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Hence the bare force and realism which so powerfully attracts in the best ballads; but this force is very different from the high strength and this involuntary realism very different from the artistic imaginative and self-chosen realism of great poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>There is the same difference as separates brilliant melodrama from great tragedy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Another sign of the undeveloped self is uncertainty of work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>There are some poets who live by a single poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>In some moment of exaltation, of rapt excitement the spirit throws off for a moment the bonds of the flesh and compels the body to obey it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This is what is vulgarly termed inspiration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Everyone who has felt this state of mind, can recall its main features.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>There is a sudden exaltation, a glow, an excitement and a fiery and rapid activity of all the faculties; every cell of the body and of the brain feeling a commotion and working in excited unison under the law of something which is not themselves; the mind itself becomes illuminated as with a rush of light and grows like a crowded and surging thoroughfare in some brilliantly lighted city, thought treading on the heels of thought faster than the tongue can express or the hand write or the memory record them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And yet while the organs of sense remain overpowered and inactive, the main organs of action may be working with abnormal rapidity, not only the speech and the hand but sometimes even the feet, so that often the writer cannot <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> remain still, but has to walk up and down swiftly or if he sits down, is subject to an involuntary mechanical movement of the limbs.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>In this state of inspiration every thought wears an extraordinary brilliance and even commonplace ideas strike one as God-given inspirations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But at any rate the expression they take whether perfect or not is superior to what the same man could compass in his ordinary condition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Ideas and imaginations throng on the mind which one is not aware of having formerly entertained or even prepared for; some even seem quite foreign to our habit of mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The impression we get is that thoughts are being breathed into us, expressions dictated, the whole poured in from outside; the saints who spoke to Joan of Arc, the daemon of Socrates, Tasso’s familiar, the Angel Gabriel dictating the Koran to Mahomet are only exaggerated developments of this impression due to an epileptic, maniac or excited state of the mind; and this, as I have already suggested, is itself due to the premature attempts of the Spirit to force the highest work on the body.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>If the understanding happens to be firm and sane, it refuses to encourage the mind in its error, but if the understanding is overexcited or is not sufficiently master of its instruments, it easily allows itself to be deluded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Now when the spirit is no longer struggling with the body, but has become its master and lord, this state of inspiration ceases to be fortuitous and occasional, and becomes more and more within the will of the man and, subject to the necessarily long intervals of repose and recreation, almost a habitually recurring state.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>At the same time it loses its violent and abnormal character and the outward symptoms of it disappear; the outer man remains placid and the mind works with great power and illumination indeed, but without disturbance or loss of equilibrium.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>This is glad tidings to all admirers of Sanscrit literature and to all lovers of their country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>For the solution of the Mahabharata problem is essential to many things, to any history worth having of Aryan civilisation and literature, to a proper appreciation of Vyasa’s poetical genius and, far more important than either, to a definite understanding of the great ethical gospel which Srikrishna came down on earth to teach as a guide to mankind in the dark Kali yuga then approaching.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But I fear that if the inquiry is to be pursued on the lines the writer of this article seemed to hint, if the Society is to rake out 8000 lines from the War Purvas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="729" href="#">1</a> and dub the result the Mahabharata of Vyasa, then the last state of the problem will be worse than its first.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>When we look more closely into the distribution of this peculiar style of writing, we come to perceive certain very suggestive and helpful facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We realise that this impress is only found in those parts of the poem which are necessary to the due conduct of the story, seldom to be detected in the more miraculous, Puranistic or trivial episodes, but usually broken up by passages and sometimes shot through with lines of a discernibly different inspiration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Equally noteworthy is it that nowhere does this poet admit any trait, incident or speech which deviates from the strict propriety of dramatic characterisation and psychological probability.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Finally Krishna’s divinity is recognized, but more often hinted at than aggressively stated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>The tendency is to keep it in the background as a fact to which, while himself crediting it, the writer does not hope for universal consent, still less is able to speak of it as of a general tenet and matter of dogmatic belief; he prefers to show Krishna rather in his human character, acting always by wise, discerning and inspired methods, but still not transgressing the limit of human possibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>All this leads one to the conclusion that in the body of poetry I have described, we have the real Bharata, an epic which tells plainly and straightforwardly of the events which led to the great war and the empire of the Bharata princes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Certainly if Prof. Weber’s venturesome assertion as to the length of the original Mahabharata be correct, this conclusion falls to the ground; for the mass of this poetry amounts to considerably over 20,000 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Professor Weber’s inference, however, is worth some discussion; for the length of the original epic is a very important element in the problem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>If we accept it, we must say farewell to all hopes of unravelling the tangle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>His assertion is founded on a single and obscure verse in the huge prolegomena to the poem which take up the greater part of the Adi Purva, no very strong basis for so far-reaching an assumption.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The sloka itself says no more than this that much of the Mahabharata was written in so difficult a style that Vyasa himself could remember only 8800 of <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> the slokas, Suka an equal amount and Sanjaya perhaps as much, perhaps something less.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>There is certainly here no assertion such as Prof. Weber would have us find in it that the Mahabharata at any time amounted to no more than 8800 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Even if we assume what the text does not say that Vyasa, Suka and Sanjaya knew the same 8800 slokas, we do not get to that conclusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The point simply is that the style of the Mahabharat was too difficult for a single man to keep in memory more than a certain portion of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>This does not carry us very far.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>If however we are to assume that there is more in this verse than meets the eye, that it is a cryptic way of stating the length of the original poem; and I do not deny that this is possible, perhaps even probable — we should note the repetition of <span class="unicod">वेत्ति</span> — <span class="unicod">अहं वेद्मि शुको वेत्ति सञ्जयो वेत्ति वा न वा</span> (<span class="devan">vetti</span> — <span class="devan">ahaṃ vedmi śuko vetti sañjayo vetti vā na vā</span>).<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Following the genius of the Sanscrit language we are led to suppose the repetition was intended to recall <span class="unicod">अष्टौ श्लोकसहस्राणि</span> (<span class="devan">aṣṭau ślokasahasrāṇi</span>) etc. with each name; otherwise the repetition has no <i>raison d’être</i>; it is otiose and inept.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>But if we understand it thus, the conclusion is irresistible that each knew a different 8800, or the writer would have no object in wishing us to repeat the number three times in our mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The length of the epic as derived from this single sloka should then be 26,400 slokas or something less, for the writer hesitates about the exact number to be attributed to Sanjaya.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>Another passage further on in the prolegomena agrees remarkably with this conclusion and is in itself much more explicit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It is there stated plainly enough that Vyasa first wrote the Mahabharata in 24,000 slokas and afterwards enlarged it to 100,000 for the world of men as well as a still more unconscionable number of verses for the Gandhurva and other worlds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>In spite of the embroidery of fancy, of a type familiar enough to all who are acquainted with the Puranic method of recording facts, the meaning of this is unmistakeable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>The original Mahabharata consisted of 24,000 slokas, but in its final form it runs to 100,000.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The figures are probably loose and slovenly, for at any rate the final form of the Mahabharata is considerably under 100,000 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>It is possible therefore that the original epic was something over 24,000 and under 26,400 slokas, in which case the two passages would agree well <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> enough.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_93"><!-- --></a>There is a mass of writing in which the verse and language is unusually bare, simple and great, full of firm and knotted thinking and a high and heroic personality, the imagination strong and pure, never florid or richly-coloured, the ideas austere, original and noble.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_94"><!-- --></a>There is another body of work sometimes massed together but far oftener interspersed in the other, which has exactly opposite qualities; it is Ramayanistic, rushing in movement, full and even overabundant in diction, flowing but not strict in thought, the imagination bold and vast, but often garish and highly-coloured, the ideas ingenious and poetical, sometimes of astonishing subtlety, but at others common and trailing, the personality much more relaxed, much less heroic, noble and severe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_95"><!-- --></a>When we look closer we find that the Ramayanistic part may possibly be separated into two parts, one of which has less inspiration and is more deeply imbued with the letter of the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="751" href="#">23</a>, but less with its spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_96"><!-- --></a>The first portion again has a certain element often in close contact with it which differs from it in a weaker inspiration, in being a body without the informing spirit of high poetry.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_238"><!-- --></a>I propose solely to draw a picture, in outline merely, of the sublime poetical personality which an analysis of the work reveals as the original poet, the Krishna Dwaipayana who wrote the Bharata of the 24,000 [slokas] and not the other Vyasa, if Vyasa he was, who enlarged it to something approaching its present dimensions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_239"><!-- --></a>And let me express at once my deep admiration of the poetical powers and vast philosophic mind of this second writer; no mean poet was he who gave us the poem we know, in many respects the greatest and most interesting and formative work in the world’s literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_240"><!-- --></a>If I seem to speak mainly in dispraise of him, it is because I am concerned here with his defects and not with his qualities; for the subject I wish to treat is Krishna of the Island, his most important characteristics and their artistic contrast with those of our other greater, but less perfect epic poet, Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="855" href="#">127</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1454"><!--SENT--><a name="s_241"><!-- --></a>I have said that no foreigner can for a moment be trusted to apply the literary test to a poem in our language; the extraordinary blunders of the most eminent German critics in dealing with Elizabethan plays have settled that question once for all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_242"><!-- --></a>Educated Indians on the other hand have their own deficiencies in dealing with Vyasa; for they have [been] nourished partly on the curious and elaborate art of Kalidasa and his gorgeous pomps of vision and colour, partly on the somewhat gaudy, expensive and meretricious spirit of English poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_243"><!-- --></a>Like Englishmen they are taught to profess a sort of official admiration for Shakespeare and Milton but with them as with the majority of Englishmen the poets they really steep themselves in are Shelley, Tennyson and Byron and to a less degree Keats and perhaps Spenser.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_244"><!-- --></a>Now the manner of these poets, lax, voluptuous, artificial, all outward glitter and colour, but inwardly poor of spirit and wanting in genuine mastery and the true poetical excellence is a bad school for the appreciation of such severe and perfect work as Vyasa’s.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>When Coleridge spoke of the femineity of genius he had in mind certain features of temperament which whether justly or not are usually thought to count for more in the feminine mould than in the masculine, the love of ornament, emotionalism, mobile impressionability, the tyranny of imagination over the reason, excessive sensitiveness to form and outward beauty; a tendency to be dominated imaginatively by violence and the show of strength, to be prodigal of oneself, not to husband the powers, to be for showing them off, to fail in self-restraint is also feminine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>All these are natural properties of the quick artistic temperament prone by throwing all itself outward to lose balance<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="857" href="#">2</a> and therefore seldom perfectly sane and strong in all its parts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>So much did these elements form the basis of Coleridge’s own temperament that he could not perhaps imagine a genius in which they were<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="858" href="#">3</a> wanting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Yet Goethe, Dante and Sophocles<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="859" href="#">4</a> show that<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="860" href="#">5</a> the very highest genius can exist without them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But none of the great poets I have named is so singularly masculine, so deficient in femineity as Vyasa, none dominates so much by intellect and personality, yet satisfies so little the romantic imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Indeed no poet at all near the first rank has the same granite mind in which impressions are received with difficulty but once received are ineffaceable<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="861" href="#">6</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>In his austere self-restraint and economy of power he is indifferent to ornament for its own sake, to the pleasures of poetry as distinguished from its ardours, to little graces and self-indulgences<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="862" href="#">7</a> of style; the substance counts for everything and the form has to limit itself to its proper work of expressing with precision and power the substance.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is indeed, I believe, the general impression of many “educated” young Indians that the Mahabharata is a mass of old wives’ stories without a spark of poetry or imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But to those who have bathed even a little in the fountain-heads<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="864" href="#">9</a> of poetry and can bear the keenness and purity of those<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="865" href="#">10</a> mountain sources, the naked and unadorned poetry of Vyasa [is a perpetual refreshment.]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="866" href="#">11</a><!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>To read him is to bathe in a chill fountain in the heats of summer; they find that one has [available an unfailing source] of tonic and [refreshment] to the soul; one [comes into relation] with a [mind] whose [bare strong contact] has the [power] of infusing strength, courage and endurance.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="867" href="#">12</a><!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>There are certain things which have this power inborn<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="868" href="#">13</a> and are accordingly valued by those who have felt deeply its properties, such are the air<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="869" href="#">14</a> of the mountains or the struggle to<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="870" href="#">15</a> a capable mind with hardship and difficulty; the Vedanta philosophy, the ideal of the <span class="unicod">निष्काम धर्म</span> (<span class="devan">niṣkāma dharma</span>), the poetry of Vyasa, three closely related entities, are intellectual forces that exercise a similar effect and attraction.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1459"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The style of this powerful writer is perhaps the one example in literature of strength in its purity; a strength undefaced by violence and excess yet not weakened by flagging and negligence.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Vyasa takes little trouble with similes, metaphors, rhetorical turns, the usual paraphernalia of poetry; nor when he uses them, is he at pains to select such as shall<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="874" href="#">19</a> be new and curiously beautiful; they are there to define more clearly what he has in mind, and he makes just enough of them for that purpose, never striving to convert them into a separate grace or </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>From this arises that frequent knottiness and excessive compression of logical sequence, that appearance of elliptical and sometimes obscure expression, which so struck the ancient critics in Vyasa and which they expressed in the legend that when dictating the Mahabharata to Ganesha, the poet in order not to be outstripped by his divine scribe — for it was Ganesha’s stipulation that not for one moment should he be left without matter to write<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="883" href="#">28</a> — threw in frequently knotty and closeknit passages which forced the lightning-swift hand to pause and labour slowly over its<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="884" href="#">29</a> work.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Of one thing, however, we may be confident in reading Vyasa, that the expression will always be just to the thought; he never palters with or labours to dress up the reality within him.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_287"><!-- --></a>It is true the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1057" href="#">202</a> also represents an Aryan civilisation idealised: Rama and Sita are more intimately characteristic types of the Hindu temperament as it finally shaped itself than are Arjouna and Draupadie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1058" href="#">203</a>; Srikrishna though his character is founded in the national type, yet rises far above it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_288"><!-- --></a>But although Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1059" href="#">204</a> writing the poem of mankind drew his chief figures in the Hindu model and Vyasa, writing a great national epic, lifted his divine hero above the basis of national character into an universal humanity, yet the original purpose of either poem remains intact.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_289"><!-- --></a>In the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1060" href="#">205</a> under the disguise of an Aryan golden age the wide world with all its elemental impulses and affections finds itself mirrored.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_290"><!-- --></a>The Mahabharata reflects rather a great Aryan civilization with the types, ideas, aims and passions of a heroic and pregnant period in the history of a high-hearted and deep-thoughted nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_291"><!-- --></a>It has, moreover, as I have attempted to indicate, a formative ethical and religious spirit which is absolutely corrective to the faults that have most marred in the past and mar to the present day the Hindu character and type of thought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_292"><!-- --></a>And it provides us with this corrective not in the form of an alien civilisation difficult to assimilate and associated with other elements as dangerous to us as this is salutary, but in a great creative work of our own literature written by the mightiest of our sages (<span class="unicod">मुनीनामप्यहं व्यासः</span> Krishna has said), one therefore who speaks our own language, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 334</p>
<p class="PE"> thinks our own thoughts and has the same national cast of mind, nature and conscience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_293"><!-- --></a>His ideals will therefore be a corrective not only to our own faults but to the dangers of that attractive but unwholesome Asura civilisation which has invaded us, especially its morbid animalism and its neurotic tendency to abandon itself to its own desires.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1652"><!--SENT--><a name="s_294"><!-- --></a>But this does not say all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_295"><!-- --></a>Vyasa too beyond the essential universality of all great poets, has his peculiar appeal to humanity in general making his poem of worldwide as well as national importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_296"><!-- --></a>By comparing him once again with Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1061" href="#">206</a> we shall realize more precisely in what this appeal consists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_297"><!-- --></a>The Titanic impulse was strong in Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1062" href="#">207</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_298"><!-- --></a>The very dimensions of his poetical canvas, the audacity and occasional recklessness of his conceptions, the gust with which he fills in the gigantic outlines of his Ravana are the essence of Titanism; his genius was so universal and Protean that no single element of it can be said to predominate, yet this tendency towards the enormous enters perhaps as largely into it as any other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_299"><!-- --></a>But to the temperament of Vyasa the Titanic was alien.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_300"><!-- --></a>It is true he carves his figures so largely (for he was a sculptor in creation rather than a painter like Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1063" href="#">208</a>) that looked at separately they seem to have colossal stature but he is always at pains so to harmonise them that they shall appear measurable to us and strongly human.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_301"><!-- --></a>They are largely and boldly human, impressive<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1064" href="#">209</a> and sublime, but never Titanic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_302"><!-- --></a>He loves the earth and the heavens but he visits not Pataala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1065" href="#">210</a> nor the stupendous regions of Vrishopurvan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1066" href="#">211</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_303"><!-- --></a>His Rakshasas, supposing them to be his at all, are epic giants or matter-of-fact ogres, but they do not exhale the breath of midnight and terror like Valmekie’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1067" href="#">212</a> demons nor the spirit of worldshaking anarchy like Valmekie’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1068" href="#">213</a> giants.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_304"><!-- --></a>This poet could never have conceived Ravana.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_305"><!-- --></a>He had neither unconscious sympathy nor a sufficient force of abhorrence to inspire him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_306"><!-- --></a>The passions of Duryodhana though presented with great force of antipathetic insight, are human and limited.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_307"><!-- --></a>The Titanic was so foreign to Vyasa’s habit of mind that he could not grasp it sufficiently either to love or hate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_308"><!-- --></a>His humanism shuts to him the outermost gates of that sublime and menacing region; he has not the secret of the storm </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 335</p>
<p class="PE"> nor has his soul ridden upon the whirlwind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_309"><!-- --></a>For his particular work this was a real advantage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_310"><!-- --></a>Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1069" href="#">214</a> has drawn for us both the divine and anarchic in extraordinary proportions; an Akbar or a Napoleon might find his spiritual kindred in Rama or Ravana; but with more ordinary beings such figures impress the sense of the sublime principally and do not dwell with them as daily acquaintances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_311"><!-- --></a>It was left for Vyasa to create epically the human divine and the human anarchic so as to bring idealisms of the conflicting moral types into line with the daily emotions and imaginations of men.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_312"><!-- --></a>The sharp distinction between Deva and Asura is one of the three distinct and peculiar contributions to ethical thought which India has to offer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_313"><!-- --></a>The legend of Indra and Virochana is one of its fundamental legends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_314"><!-- --></a>Both of them came to Vrihaspati to know from him of God; he told them to go home and look in the mirror.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_315"><!-- --></a>Virochana saw himself there and concluding that he was God, asked no farther; he gave full rein to the sense of individuality in himself which he mistook for the deity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_316"><!-- --></a>But Indra was not satisfied: feeling that there must be some mistake he returned to Vrihaspati and received from him the true Godknowledge which taught him that he was God only because all things were God, since nothing existed but the One.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_317"><!-- --></a>If he was the one God, so was his enemy; the very feelings of separateness and enmity were no<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1070" href="#">215</a> permanent reality but transient phenomena.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_318"><!-- --></a>The Asura therefore is he who is profoundly conscious of his own separate individuality and yet would impose it on the world as the sole individuality; he is thus blown along on the hurricane of his desires and ambitions until he stumbles and is broken, in the great phrase of Aeschylus, against the throne of Eternal Law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_319"><!-- --></a>The Deva on the contrary stands firm in the luminous heaven of self-knowledge; his actions flow not inward towards himself but outwards toward the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_320"><!-- --></a>The distinction that India<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1071" href="#">216</a> draws is not between altruism and egoism but between disinterestedness and desire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_321"><!-- --></a>The altruist is profoundly conscious of himself and he is really ministering to himself even in his altruism; hence the hot and sickly odour of sentimentalism and the taint of the Pharisee which clings about European altruism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_322"><!-- --></a>With the perfect Hindu the feeling of self <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> has been merged in the sense of the universe; he does his duty equally whether it happens to promote the interests of others or his own; if his action seems oftener altruistic than egoistic it is because our duty oftener coincides with the interests of others than with our own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_323"><!-- --></a>Rama’s duty as a son calls him to sacrifice himself, to leave the empire of the world and become a beggar and a hermit; he does it cheerfully and unflinchingly: but when Sita is taken from him, it is his duty as a husband to rescue her from her ravisher and as a Kshatriya to put Ravana to death if he persists in wrongdoing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1072" href="#">217</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_324"><!-- --></a>This duty also he pursues with the same unflinching energy as the first.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_325"><!-- --></a>He does not shrink from the path of the right because it coincides with the path of self-interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_326"><!-- --></a>The Pandavas also go without a word into exile and poverty, because honour demands it of them; but their ordeal over, they will not, though ready to drive compromise to its utmost verge, consent to succumb utterly to Duryodhana, for it is their duty as Kshatriyas to protect the world from the reign of injustice, even though it is at their own expense that injustice seeks to reign.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_327"><!-- --></a>The Christian and Buddhistic doctrine of turning the other cheek to the smiter, is as dangerous as it is impracticable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_328"><!-- --></a>The continual European see-saw between Christ on the one side and the flesh and the devil on the other with the longer trend towards the latter comes straight from a radically false moral distinction and the lip profession of an ideal which mankind has never been either able or willing to carry into practice.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1657"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The Mahabharata, although neither the greatest nor the richest masterpiece of the secular literature of India, is at the same time its most considerable and important body of poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Being so it is the pivot on which the history of Sanscrit literature, and incidentally the history of Aryan civilisation in India, must perforce turn.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>To the great discredit of European scholarship the problem of this all-important work is one that remains not only unsolved, but untouched.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Yet until it is solved, until the confusion of its heterogeneous materials is reduced to some sort of order, the different layers of which it consists separated, classed and attributed to their relative dates, and its relations with the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1073" href="#">2</a> on the one hand and the Puranic and classic literature on the other fully and patiently examined, the history of our civilisation must remain in the air, a field for pedantic wranglings and worthless conjectures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The world knows something of our origins because much labour has been bestowed on the Vedas, something of our decline because post-Buddhistic literature has been much read, annotated and discussed, but of our great medial and flourishing period it knows little, and that little is neither coherent nor reliable.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1658"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>All that we know of the Mahabharata at present is that it is the work of several hands and of different periods — this is literally the limit of the reliable knowledge European scholarship has so far been able to extract from it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>For the rest we have to be content with arbitrary conjectures based either upon<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1074" href="#">3</a> an unwarrantable application of European analogies to Indian things or random assumptions snatched from a word here or a line there, but never proceeding from that weighty, careful and unbiassed </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 338</p>
<p class="PE"> study of the work canto by canto, passage by passage, line by line, which can alone bring us to any valuable conclusions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>A fancy was started in Germany that the Iliad of Homer is really a pastiche or clever rifacimento of old ballads put together in the time of Pisistratus,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1075" href="#">4</a><!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This truly barbarous imagination with its rude ignorance of the psychological bases of all great poetry has now fallen into some discredit; it has been replaced by a more plausible attempt to discover a nucleus in the poem, an Achilleid, out of which the larger Iliad has grown.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Very possibly the whole discussion will finally end in the restoration of a single Homer with a single poem subjected indeed to some inevitable interpolation and corruption, but mainly the work of one mind, a theory still held by more than one considerable scholar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>In the meanwhile, however, haste has been made to apply the analogy to the Mahabharata; lynx-eyed theorists have discovered in the poem — apparently without taking the trouble to study it — an early and rude ballad epic worked up, doctored and defaced by those wicked Brahmins, who are made responsible for all the literary and other enormities which have been discovered by the bushelful, and not by European lynxes alone<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1076" href="#">5</a> — in our literature and civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Now whether<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1077" href="#">6</a> the theory is true or not, and one sees nothing in its favour, it has at present no value at all; for it is a pure theory without any justifying facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It is not difficult to build these intellectual cardhouses; anyone may raise them by the dozen who<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1078" href="#">7</a> can find no better manner of wasting valuable time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>A similar method of “arguing from Homer” is probably at the bottom of Professor Weber’s assertion that the War Purvas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1079" href="#">8</a> contain the original epic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>An observant eye at once perceives that the War Purvas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1080" href="#">9</a> are far more<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1081" href="#">10</a> hopelessly tangled than any that precede them except the first.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is here and here only that the keenest eye becomes confused and the most confident explorer begins to lose heart and self-reliance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But the Iliad is all battles and it therefore follows in the European mind that the original Mahabharata must have been all battles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Another method is <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> that of ingenious, if forced argument from stray slokas of the poem or equally<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1082" href="#">11</a> stray and obscure remarks in Buddhist compilations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The curious theory of some scholars that the Pandavas were a later invention and that the original war was between the Kurus and Panchalas only and Professor Weber’s singularly positive inference from a sloka which does not at first sight bear<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1083" href="#">12</a> the meaning he puts on it, that the original epic contained only 8800 lines<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1084" href="#">13</a>, are ingenuities of this type.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>They are based on the Teutonic art of building a whole mammoth out of a single and often problematical bone, and remind one strongly of Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Pickwick and the historic inscription which was so rudely, if in a Pickwickian sense, challenged by the refractory [Mr. Blotton.]<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>All these theorisings are idle enough; they are made of too airy a stuff to last.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>(Only a serious scrutiny of the Mahabharat made with a deep sense of critical responsibility and according to the methods of patient scientific inference, can justify on in advancing any considerable theory on this wonderful poetic structure<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1085" href="#">14</a>.)<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1659"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Yet to extricate the original epic from the mass of accretions is not, I believe, so difficult a task as it may at first appear.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>One is struck in perusing the Mahabharata by the presence of a mass of poetry which bears the style and impress of a single, strong and original, even unusual mind, differing in his manner of expression, tone of thought and stamp of personality not only from every other Sanscrit poet we know but from every other great poet known to literature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>When we look more closely into the distribution of this peculiar style of writing, we come to perceive certain very suggestive and helpful facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>We realise that this impress is only found in those parts of the poem which are necessary to the due conduct of the story, seldom to be detected in the more miraculous, Puranistic or trivial episodes, but usually broken up by passages and sometimes shot through with lines of a discernibly different inspiration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Equally noteworthy is it that nowhere does this poet<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1086" href="#">15</a> admit any trait, incident or speech which deviates from the strict propriety of dramatic characterisation and psychological probability.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Finally Krishna’s divinity<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1087" href="#">16</a> is recognized, but more often hinted at than aggressively stated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The tendency is to keep it in the background as a fact to which, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 340</p>
<p class="PE"> while himself crediting it, the writer does not hope for universal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1088" href="#">17</a> consent, still less is able to speak of it as of a general<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1089" href="#">18</a> tenet and matter of dogmatic belief; he prefers to show Krishna rather in his human character, acting always by wise, discerning and inspired methods, but still not transgressing the limit of human possibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>All this leads one to the conclusion that in the body of poetry I have described, we have the real Bharata, an epic which tells plainly and straightforwardly of the events which led to the great war and the empire of the Bharata princes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Certainly if Prof. Weber’s venturesome assertion as to the length of the original Mahabharata be correct, this conclusion falls to the ground; for the mass of this poetry amounts to considerably over 20,000 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Professor Weber’s inference, however, is worth some discussion; for the length of the original epic is a very important element in the problem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>If we accept it, we must say farewell to all hopes of unravelling the tangle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>His assertion is founded on a single and obscure verse in the huge prolegomena to the poem which take<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1090" href="#">19</a> up the greater part of the Adi Purva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1091" href="#">20</a>, no very strong basis for so far-reaching an assumption.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The sloka itself says no more than this that much of the Mahabharata was written in so difficult a style that Vyasa himself could remember only 8800 of the slokas, Suka an equal amount and Sanjaya perhaps as much, perhaps something less.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>There is certainly here no assertion such as Prof. Weber would have us find in it that the Mahabharata at any time amounted to no more than 8800 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Even if we assume what the text does not say that Vyasa, Suka and Sanjaya knew the same 8800 slokas, we do not get to that conclusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The point simply is that the style of the Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1092" href="#">21</a> was too difficult for a single man to keep in memory more than a certain portion of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>This does not carry us very far.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>If<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1093" href="#">22</a>however we are to assume that there is more in this verse than<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1094" href="#">23</a> meets the eye, that it is a cryptic way of stating the length of the original poem; and I do not deny that this is possible, perhaps even probable — we should note the repetition of <span class="unicod">वेत्ति</span> — <span class="unicod">अहं वेद्मि शुको वेत्ति सञ्जयो वेत्ति वा न वा</span>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Following the genius of the Sanscrit 
language we are led to suppose the repetition was intended to recall<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1095" href="#">24</a> <span class="unicod">अष्टौ श्लोकसहस्राणि</span> etc. with each name; otherwise the repetition has <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> no <i>raison d’être</i>; it is otiose and inept.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>But if we understand it thus, the conclusion is irresistible that each knew a different 8800, or the writer<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1096" href="#">25</a> would have no object in wishing us to repeat the number three times in our mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The length of the epic as derived from this single sloka should then be 26,400 slokas or something less<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1097" href="#">26</a>, for the writer hesitates about the exact number to be attributed to Sanjaya.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Another passage further<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1098" href="#">27</a> on in the prolegomena agrees remarkably with this conclusion and is in itself much more explicit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>It is there stated plainly enough that Vyasa first wrote the Mahabharata in 24,000 slokas and afterwards enlarged it to 100,000 for the world of men<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1099" href="#">28</a> as well as a still more unconscionable number of verses for the Gandhurva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1100" href="#">29</a> and other worlds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>In spite of the embroidery of fancy, of a type familiar enough to all who are acquainted with the Puranic method of recording facts, the meaning of this is unmistakeable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The original Mahabharata consisted of 24,000 slokas, but in its final form it runs to 100,000.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The figures are probably loose and slovenly, for at any rate the final<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1101" href="#">30</a> form of the Mahabharata is considerably under 100,000 slokas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>It is possible therefore that the original epic was something over 24,000 and under 26,400 slokas, in which case the two passages would agree well enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>But it would be unsafe to found any dogmatic assertion on isolated couplets; at the most we can say that we are justified in taking the estimate as a probable and workable hypothesis and if it is found to be corroborated by other facts, we may venture to suggest its correctness as a moral certainty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1660"><!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>This body of poetry then, let us suppose, is the original Mahabharata.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Tradition attributes it to Krishna of the Island called Vyasa who certainly lived about this time and was an editor of the Vedas; and since there is nothing in this part of the poem which makes the tradition impossible and much which favours it, we may, as a matter both of convenience and of probability<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1102" href="#">31</a>, accept it at least provisionally.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1664"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The problem of the Mahabharata, its origin, date and composition, is one that seems likely to elude scholarship to times indefinite if not for ever.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is true that several European scholars have solved all these to their own satisfaction, but their industrious and praiseworthy efforts [<i>incomplete</i>]<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1665">*</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1666"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>In the following pages I have approached the eternal problem of the Mahabharata from the point of view mainly of style and literary personality, partly of substance; but in dealing with the substance I have deferred questions of philosophy, allusion and verbal evidence to which a certain school attach great importance and ignored altogether the question of minute metrical details on which they base far-reaching conclusions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is necessary therefore out of respect for these scholars to devote some little space<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1103" href="#">1</a> to an explanation of my standpoint.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I contend that owing to the peculiar manner in which the Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1104" href="#">2</a> has been composed, these minutiae of detail and word have very little value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The labour of this minute school has proved beyond dispute one thing and one only<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1105" href="#">3</a>, that the Mahabharat<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1106" href="#">4</a> was not only immensely enlarged, crusted with interpolations and accretions and in parts rewritten and modified, but even its oldest parts were verbally modified in the course of preservation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The extent to which this happened, has I think been grossly exaggerated, but that it did happen, one cannot but be convinced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Now if this is so, it is obvious that arguments from verbal niceties must be very dangerous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It has been sought to prove from a single word <i>suranga</i>, an underground tunnel, which European scholars believe to be identical with the Greek <span class="unicod_norm">σῦριγξ</span> 
[<i>suringks</i>] that the account in the Adi Purva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1107" href="#">5</a> of the Pandavas’ escape from the burning house of Purochana through an underground tunnel must be later than another account in the Vana Purva<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1108" href="#">6</a> which represents Bhema<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1109" href="#">7</a> as carrying his brothers and mother out of the flames; for the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 343</p>
<p class="PE"> former they say, must have been composed after the Indians had learned the Greek language and culture and the latter, it is to be assumed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1110" href="#">8</a>, before that interesting period.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Now whether <i>suranga</i> was derived from the Greek <span class="unicod_norm">σῦριγξ</span> 
[<i>suringks</i>] or not, I cannot take upon me to say, but will assume on the authority of better linguists than myself that it was so though I think it is as well to be sceptical of all such Greek derivations until the connection is proved beyond doubt, for such words even when not accounted for by Sanscrit itself, may very easily be borrowed from the aboriginal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1111" href="#">9</a> languages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Bengali for instance preserves the form <span class="devan">suḍanga</span> where the cerebral letter is Dravidian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But if so, if this word came into fashion along with Greek culture, and became <i>the</i> word for a tunnel, what could be more natural than that the reciter should substitute for an old and now disused<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1112" href="#">10</a> word the one which was familiar to his audience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Again much has been made of the frequent occurrence of Yavana, Vahlika, Pehlava, Saka, Huna.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>As to Yavana its connection with <span class="unicod_norm">Ίάων</span> 
[<i>Iaon</i>] does not seem to me beyond doubt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It had certainly been<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1113" href="#">11</a> at one time applied to the Bactrian Greeks, but so it has been and is to the present day applied to the Persians, Afghans and other races to the northwest of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Nor is the philological connection between <span class="unicod_norm">Ίάων</span> 
[<i>Iaon</i>] and Yavana very clear to my mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Another form Yauna seems to represent <span class="unicod_norm">Ίάων</span> 
[<i>Iaon</i>] fairly well; but are we sure that Yauna and Yavana were originally identical?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>A mere resemblance however close is the most misleading thing in philology.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Upon such resemblances Pocock made out a very strong case for his theory that the Greeks were a Hindu colony.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The identity of the Sakas and Sakyas was for a long time a pet theory of European Sanscritists and on this identity was based the theory that Buddha was a Scythian reformer of Hinduism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>This identity is now generally given up, yet it is quite as close as that of Yavana and Yauna and as closely in accordance with the laws of the Sanscrit language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If Yauna is the original form, why was it changed to Yavana; it is no more necessary than that mauna be changed to mavana; if Yavana be earlier and Yauna a Pracrit corruption, how are we to account for the short a and the v; there was no digamma in Greek in the time of Alexander.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But since the Greeks are always called <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> Yavanas in Buddhist writings we will waive the demand for strict philological intelligibility and suppose that Yavana answers to <span class="unicod_norm">Ίάων </span>
[<i>Iaon</i>].<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The question yet remains when did the Hindus become acquainted with the existence of the Greeks.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Now here the first consideration is why did they call the Greeks Ionians, and not Hellenes or Macedonians?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>That the Persians should know the Greeks by that name is natural enough, for it was with the Ionians that they first came in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1114" href="#">12</a> contact; but it was not Ionians who invaded India under Alexander, it was not an Ionian prince who gave his daughter to Chundragupta<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1115" href="#">13</a>, it was not an Ionian conqueror who crossed the Indus and besieged [    ].<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Did the Macedonians on their victorious march give themselves out as Ionians?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>I for my part do not believe it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is certain therefore that if the Hindus took the word Yavana from <span class="unicod_norm">Ίάων </span>
[<i>Iaon</i>], it must have been through the Persians and not direct from the Greek language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But the connection of the Persians with India was as old as Darius Hystaspes who had certainly reason to know the Greeks.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It is therefore impossible to say that the Indians had not heard about the Greeks as long ago as 500 B.<!--/SENT--><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>C.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Even if they had not, the mention of Yavanas and Yavan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1116" href="#">14</a> kings does not carry us very far; for it is evident that in the earlier parts of the Mahabharata they are known only as a strong barbarian power of the Northwest; there is no sign of their culture being known to the Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is therefore quite possible that the word Yavana now grown familiar may have been substituted by the later reciters for an older name no longer familiar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It is now known beyond reasonable doubt that the Mahabharata war was fought out in or about 1190 B.C.; Dhritarashtra, son of Vichitravirya, Krishna, son of Devaki and Janamejaya are mentioned in Vedic works of a very early date.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>There is therefore no reason to doubt that an actual historical event is recorded with whatever admixture of fiction in the Mahabharata.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is also evident that the Mahabharata, not any “Bharata” or “Bharati Katha” but the Mahabharata existed before the age of Panini, and tho’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1117" href="#">15</a> the radical school bring down Panini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1118" href="#">16</a><!--/SENT--> [<i>incomplete</i>]</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Address at the Baroda College Social </h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1721"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>In addressing you on an occasion like the present, it is inevitable that the mind should dwell on one feature of this gathering above all others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Held as it is towards the close of the year, I am inevitably reminded that many of its prominent members are with us for the last time in their College life, and I am led to speculate with both hope and anxiety on their future careers, and this not only because several familiar faces are to disappear from us and scatter into different parts of the country and various walks of life, but also because they go out from us as our finished work, and it is by their character and life that our efforts will be judged.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>When I say, our efforts, I allude not merely to the professorial work of teaching, not to book-learning only, but to the entire activity of the College as a great and complex educational force, which is not solely meant to impart information, but to bring out or give opportunities for bringing out all the various intellectual and other energies which go to make up a man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>And here is the side of collegiate institutions of which this Social Gathering especially reminds us, the force of the social life it provides in moulding the character and the mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I think it will not be out of place, if in dwelling on this I revert to the great Universities of Oxford and Cambridge which are our famous exemplars, and point out a few differences between those Universities and our own and the thoughts those differences may well suggest.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1722"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>I think there is no student of Oxford or Cambridge who does not look back in after days on the few years of his undergraduate life as, of all the scenes he has moved in, that which calls up the happiest memories, and it is not surprising that this should be so, when we remember what that life must have meant to him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>He </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 354</p>
<p class="PE"> goes up from the restricted life of his home and school and finds himself in surroundings which with astonishing rapidity expand his intellect, strengthen his character, develop his social faculties, force out all his abilities and turn him in three years from a boy into a man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>His mind ripens in the contact with minds which meet from all parts of the country and have been brought up in many various kinds of trainings, his unwholesome eccentricities wear away and the unsocial, egoistic elements of character are to a large extent discouraged.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>He moves among ancient and venerable buildings, the mere age and beauty of which are in themselves an education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>He has the Union which has trained so many great orators and debaters, has been the first trial ground of so many renowned intellects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>He has, too, the athletics clubs organized with a perfection unparalleled elsewhere, in which, if he has the physique and the desire for them he may find pursuits which are also in themselves an education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The result is that he who entered the University a raw student, comes out of it a man and a gentleman, accustomed to think of great affairs and fit to move in cultivated society, and he remembers his College and University with affection, and in after days if he meets with those who have studied with him he feels attracted towards them as to men with whom he has a natural brotherhood.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This is the social effect I should like the Colleges and Universities of India also to exercise, to educate by social influences as well as those which are merely academical and to create the feeling among their pupils that they belong to the community, that they are children of one mother.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>There are many obstacles to this result in the circumstances<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1146" href="#">2</a> of Indian Universities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Colleges are not collected in one town but are scattered among many and cannot assemble within themselves so large and various a life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>They are new also, the creation of not more than fifty years — and fifty years is a short period in the life of a University.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But so far as circumstances allow, there is an attempt to fill up the deficiency, in your Union, your Debating Club and Reading Room, your athletic sports and Social Gathering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>For the success of this attempt time is needed, but your efforts are also needed: and I ask you who are soon to go out into the world, not to forget your <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> College or regard it as a mere episode in your life, but rather as one to whose care you must look back and recompense it by your future life and work, and if you meet fellow-students, alumni of the same College, to meet them as friends, as brothers.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1723"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>There is another point in which a wide difference exists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>What makes Oxford and Cambridge not local institutions but great and historic Universities?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is the number of great and famous men, of brilliant intellects in every department which have issued from them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>I should like you to think seriously of this aspect of the question also.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>In England the student feels a pride in his own University and College, wishes to see their traditions maintained, and tries to justify them to the world by his own success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This feeling has yet to grow up among us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>And I would appeal to you — who are leaving us — to help to create it, to cherish it yourselves, to try and justify the College of its pupils.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Of course, there is one preliminary method by which the students can add fame to their College.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Success in examinations, though preliminary merely, and not an end in itself, is nevertheless of no small effect or importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>You all know how the recent success of an Indian student has filled the whole country with joy and enthusiasm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>That success reflects fame not only on India but on his University and College, and when the name of the first Indian Senior Wrangler is mentioned, it will also be remembered that he belonged to Cambridge and to St. John’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But examinations, however important, are only a preliminary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>I lay stress upon this because there is too much of a tendency in this country to regard education as a mere episode, finished when once the degree is obtained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But the University cannot and does not pretend to complete a man’s education; it merely gives some materials to his hand or points out certain paths he may tread, and it says to him, — “Here are the materials I have given into your hands, it is for you to make of them what you can;” or — “These are the paths I have equipped you to travel; it is yours to tread them to the end, and by your success in them justify me before the world.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1724"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>I would ask you therefore to remember these things in your future life, not to drop the effects of your College training as </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 356</p>
<p class="PE"> no longer necessary, but, to strive for eminence and greatness in your own lines, and by the brilliance of your names add lustre to the first nursing home of your capacities, to cherish its memory with affection as that which equipped your intellects, trained you into men, and strove to give you such social life as might fit you for the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>And finally I would ask you not to sever yourselves in after days from it, but if you are far, to welcome its alumni when you meet them with brotherly feelings and if you are near to keep up connection with it, not to regard the difference of age between yourselves and its future students but associate with them, be present at such occasions as this social gathering and evince by your acts your gratitude for all that it did for you in the past.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1728"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The subject on which I wish to address you this evening, and if you are sufficiently interested and have sufficient patience to pursue the subject farther with me, for perhaps another evening or two, is Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Some of you may ask yourselves, why this subject rather than another?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is not a new subject but rather quite a threadbare one; you have already heard and read much about it and probably listened to much better lectures on the subject than any I can give you; it has besides been handled by a great many men in high places of authority; most of all, it has been taken up by no less a person than Lord Curzon himself and measures are to be formulated and perhaps carried into execution for the reform of what is defective in the present system.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>“What more do you want,” you will perhaps ask, “or why should we trouble ourselves about it?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The Government of India will in its own good time reform the whole business and of course when their new system is in force the Baroda Schools and Colleges will assimilate themselves to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile it is quite superfluous for us to bother our heads about the matter.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Now in answer to that attitude I have to say this that the Government of India is in the first place not the fit body to formulate the necessary improvements and in the second place not the fit instrument to put them into force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is not fit to formulate them because it cannot realise and feel as we do where the shoe pinches us and therefore in mending it [<i>incomplete</i>]<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1730"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We now come to the intellectual part of education, which is certainly larger<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1147" href="#">1</a> and more difficult, although not more important than physical training and edification of character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Indian </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 358</p>
<p class="PE"> University system has confined itself entirely to this branch and it might have been thought that this limitation and concentration of energy ought to have been attended by special efficiency and thoroughness in the single branch it had chosen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But unfortunately this is not the case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>If the physical training it provides is contemptible and the moral training nil, the mental training is also meagre in quantity and worthless in quality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>People commonly say that it is because the services and professions are made the object of education that this state of things exists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>This I believe to be a great mistake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>A degree is necessary for service and therefore people try to get a degree.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Good! let it remain so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But in order for a student to get a degree let us make it absolutely necessary that he shall have a good education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>If a worthless education is sufficient in order to secure his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1148" href="#">2</a> object and a good education quite unessential, it is obvious that the student will not incur great trouble and diversion of energy in order to acquire what he feels to be unnecessary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But change this state of things, make culture and true science essential and the same interested motive which now makes him content with a bad education will then compel him to strive after culture and true science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>As practical men we must recognise that the pure enthusiasm of knowledge for knowledge’s sake operates only on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1149" href="#">3</a> exceptional minds or in exceptional eras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>In civilised countries a general desire for knowledge as a motive for education does exist but it is largely accompanied with the earthier feeling that knowledge is necessary to keep up one’s position in society or to succeed in certain lucrative or respectable pursuits and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1150" href="#">4</a> professions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We in India have become so barbarous that we send our children to school with the grossest utilitarian motives<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1151" href="#">5</a> unmixed with any disinterested desire for knowledge; but the education we receive is itself responsible for this.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Nobody can cherish disinterested enthusiasm for a bad education; it can only be regarded as a means to some practical end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But make the education good, thorough and interesting and the love of knowledge will of itself awake in the mind and so mingle with and modify more selfish objects.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1731"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The real source<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1152" href="#">6</a> of the evil we complain of is therefore something different; it is a fundamental and deplorable error by which </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 359</p>
<p class="PE"> we in this country have confused education with the acquisition of knowledge and interpreted knowledge itself in a singularly narrow and illiberal sense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>To give the student knowledge is necessary, but it is still more necessary to build up in him the power of using his knowledge<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1153" href="#">7</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It would hardly be a good technical education for a carpenter to be taught how to fell trees so as to provide himself with wood and never to learn how to prepare tables, chairs and cabinets or even what tools were necessary for his craft.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Yet this is precisely what our system of education does.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It trains the memory and provides the student with a store of facts and secondhand ideas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The memory is the woodcutter’s axe and the store he acquires is the wood he has cut down in his course of tree felling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>When he has done this, the University says to him “We now declare you a Bachelor of Carpentry; we have given you a good and sharp axe and a fair nucleus of wood to begin with.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Go on, my son, the world is full of forests and provided the Forest Officer does not object you can cut down trees and provide yourself with wood to your heart’s content.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Now the student who goes forth thus equipped, may become a great timber-merchant but unless he is an exceptional genius he will never be even a moderate carpenter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Or to return from the simile to the fact<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1154" href="#">8</a>, the graduate from our colleges may be a good clerk, a decent vakil or a tolerable medical practitioner, but unless he is an especial<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1155" href="#">9</a> genius, he will never be a great administrator or a great lawyer or an eminent medical specialist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>These eminences have to be filled up mainly by Europeans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>If an Indian wishes to rise to them, he has to travel thousands of miles over the sea in order to breathe an atmosphere of liberal knowledge, original science and sound culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>And even then he seldom succeeds, because his lungs are too debilitated to take in a good long breath of that atmosphere.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1732"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The first fundamental mistake has been, therefore, to confine ourselves to the training of the storing faculty memory and the storage of facts and to neglect the training of the three great manipulating<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1156" href="#">10</a> faculties, viz. the power of reasoning, the power of comparison and differentiation and the power of expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>These powers are present to a certain extent in all men above the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 360</p>
<p class="PE"> state of the savage and even in a rudimentary state in the savage himself; but they exist especially developed in the higher classes of civilised nations, wherever these higher classes have long centuries of education behind them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But, however highly developed by nature, these powers demand cultivation, they demand that bringing out of natural abilities which is the real essence of education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>If not so brought<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1157" href="#">11</a> out in youth, they become rusted and stopped with dirt, so that they cease to act except in a feeble, narrow and partial manner.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Exceptional genius does indeed assert itself in spite of neglect and discouragement, but even genius self-developed does not often achieve<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1158" href="#">12</a> as happy results and as free and large a working as the same genius properly equipped and trained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Amount of knowledge is in itself not of the first<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1159" href="#">13</a> importance; but to make the best use of what we know.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The easy assumption of our educationists that we have only to supply the mind with a smattering of facts in each department of knowledge and the mind can be trusted to develop itself and take its own suitable road, is contrary to science, contrary to human experience and contrary to the universal opinion of civilised countries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Indeed the history of intellectual degeneration in gifted races always begins with the arrest of these three mental powers by the excessive cultivation of mere knowledge at their expense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Much as we have lost as a nation, we have always preserved our intellectual alertness, quickness and originality; but even this last gift is threatened by our University system, and if it goes, it will be the beginning of irretrievable degradation and final extinction.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1733"><!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The very first step in reform must therefore be to revolutionize the whole aims and methods<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1160" href="#">14</a> of our education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We must accustom teachers to devote nine-tenths of their energies<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1161" href="#">15</a> to the education of the active mental faculties, while the passive retaining<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1162" href="#">16</a> faculty, which we call the memory, should occupy a recognised and well-defined but subordinate place, and we must direct our school and university examinations to the testing of these active faculties and not of the memory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>For this is an object which cannot be effected<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1163" href="#">17</a> by the mere change or rearrangement of the curriculum.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>It is true that certain subjects are more apt to develop certain faculties than others; the power of accurate </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 361</p>
<p class="PE"> reasoning is powerfully assisted by Geometry, Logic and Political Economy; one of the most important results of languages is to refine and train the power of expression, and nothing more enlarges the power of comparison and differentiation than an intelligent study of history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>But no particular subject except language is essential, still less exclusively appropriated<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1164" href="#">18</a>, to any given faculty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>There are types of intellect, for instance, which are constitutionally incapable of dealing with geometrical problems or even with the formal machinery of Logic, and are yet profound, brilliant and correct reasoners in other intellectual spheres.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>There is in fact hardly any subject, the sciences of calculation excepted, which in the hands of a capable teacher, does not give room for the development of all the general faculties of the mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The first thing needed therefore is the entire and unsparing rejection of the present methods of teaching in favour of those which are now being universally adopted in the more advanced countries of Europe.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1734"><!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But even in the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1165" href="#">19</a> narrower sphere of knowledge acquisition to which our system has confined itself, it has been guilty of other blunders quite as serious.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Apart from pure mathematics, which stands on a footing of its own, knowledge may be divided into two great heads, the knowledge of things and the knowledge of men, i.e. to say<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1166" href="#">20</a> of human thought, human actions, human nature and human creations as recorded, preserved or pictured in literature, history, philosophy and art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The latter is covered in the term humanities or humane letters, and the idea of a liberal education was formerly confined to these, though it was subsequently widened to include mathematics and has again been widened in modern times to include a modicum of science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The humanities, mathematics and science are therefore the three sisters in the family of knowledge and any self-respecting system of education must in these days provide facilities for mastery in any one of these as well as for a modicum of all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The first great error of our system comes in here.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>While we insist on passing our students through a rigid and cast-iron course of knowledge in everything, we give them real knowledge in nothing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>[What does an average Bombay graduate who has taken English Literature for </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>When we remember that English is the main study of our schools and colleges, what a miserable outturn is this, what a wretched little mouse out of that mountain of drudgery from which the voice of the oppressed student is heard painfully and monotonously repeating like Valmekie under his mound the lesson with which he has been crammed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>But he is far more unfortunate than Valmekie, his mar mar mar has not been converted into Ram Ram Ram; for while he thinks he has been repeating the saving word which gives intellectual salvation, it has been unknown to him converted into a death dealing word which causes intellectual sterility and impotence.]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1167" href="#">21</a><!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1735"><!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>Mathematics for instance is a subject in which it ought not to be difficult to give thorough knowledge, for most<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1168" href="#">22</a> of its<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1169" href="#">23</a> paths are well beaten and being a precise and definite subject it does not in itself demand so much and such various powers<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1170" href="#">24</a> of original thought and appreciation as literature and history; yet it is the invariable experience of the most brilliant mathematical students who go from Calcutta or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1171" href="#">25</a> Bombay to Cambridge that after the first year they have exhausted all they have already learned and have to enter on entirely new and unfamiliar result.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Brain of India [I]</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1738"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The time has perhaps come for the Indian mind, long pre-occupied with political and economic issues, for a widening of its horizon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Such a widening is especially necessary for Bengal.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1739"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Bengali has always led and still leads the higher thought of India, because he has eminently the gifts which are most needed for the new race that has to arise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>He has the emotion and imagination which is open to the great inspirations, the mighty heart-stirring ideas that move humanity when a great step forward has to be taken.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>He has the invaluable gift of thinking with the heart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>He has, too, a subtle brain which is able within certain limits to catch shades of meaning and delicacies of thought, both those the logic grasps and those which escape the mere logical intellect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Above all, he has in a greater degree than other races the yet undeveloped faculty of direct knowledge, latent in humanity and now to be evolved, which is above reason and imagination, the faculty which in Sri Ramakrishna, the supreme outcome of the race, dispensed with education and commanded any knowledge he desired easily and divinely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is a faculty which now works irregularly in humanity, unrecognised and confused by the interference of the imagination, of the limited reason and of the old associations or <span class="devan">saṃskāras</span> stored in the memory of the race and the individual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It cannot be made a recognised and habitual agent except by the discipline which the ancient Indian sages formulated in the science of Yoga.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But certain races have the function more evolved or more ready for evolution than the generality of mankind, and it is these that will lead in the future evolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>In addition, the race has a mighty will-power which comes from the long worship of Shakti and practice of the Tantra that has been a part of our culture for many centuries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>No other people could have revolutionised its </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 366</p>
<p class="PE"> whole national character in a few years as Bengal has done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The Bengali has always worshipped the Divine Energy in her most terrible as well as in her most beautiful aspects; whether as the Beautiful or the Terrible Mother he has never shrunk from her whether in fear or in awe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>When the divine force flowed into him he has never feared to yield himself up to it and follow the infinite prompting, careless whither it led.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>As a reward he has become the most perfect <span class="devan">ādhāra</span> of Shakti, the most capable and swiftly sensitive and responsive receptacle of the Infinite Will and Energy the world now holds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Recently that Will and Energy has rushed into him and has been lifting him to the level of his future mission and destiny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>He has now to learn the secret of drawing the Mother of Strength into himself and holding her there in a secure possession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>That is why we have pointed to a religious and a spiritual awakening as the next necessity and the next inevitable development.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1740"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But along with his great possessions the Bengali has serious deficiencies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In common with the rest of India he has a great deficiency of knowledge, the result of an education meagre in quantity and absolutely vicious in method and quality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>And he is inferior to other Indian races, such as the Madrasi and Maratha, in the capacity of calm, measured and comprehensive deliberation which is usually called intellect or reasoning power, and which, though it is far from the whole of thought, is essential to the completeness of thought and action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>By itself the logical or reasoning intellect creates the accurate and careful scholar, the sober critic, the rationalist and cautious politician, the conservative scientist, that great mass of human intelligence which makes for slow and careful progress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It does not create the hero and the originator, the inspired prophet, the mighty builder, the maker of nations; it does not conquer nature and destiny, lay its hand on the future, command the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The rest of India is largely dominated by this faculty and limited by it, therefore it lags behind while Bengal rushes forward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The rest of India has feared to deliver itself to the Power that came down from above to uplift the nation; it has either denied its call or made reservations and insisted on guiding it and reining it in.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Hence those astonishing feats of memory, various comprehension and versatility of creative work of which only a few extraordinary intellects have been capable in Occidental history, but which in ancient India were common and usual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gladstone was considered to be the possessor of an astonishing memory because he could repeat the whole of Homer’s Iliad, beginning from any passage suggested to him and flowing on as long as required; but to a Brahmin of the old times this would have been a proof of a capacity neither unusual nor astonishing, but rather, petty and limited.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The many-sidedness of an Eratosthenes or the range of a Herbert Spencer have created in Europe admiring or astonished comment; but the universality of the ordinary curriculum in ancient India was for every student and not for the exceptional few, and it implied, not a tasting of many subjects after the modern plan, but the thorough mastery of all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The original achievement of a Kalidasa accomplishing the highest in every line of poetic creation is so incredible to the European mind that it has been sought to cleave that mighty master of harmonies into a committee of three.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The highest creative intellects in Europe have achieved sovereignty by limitation, by striving to excel only in one field of a single intellectual province or at most in two; when they have been versatile it has been by sacrificing height to breadth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But in India it is the greatest who have been the most versatile and passed from one field of achievement to another without sacrificing an inch of their height or an iota of their creative intensity, easily, unfalteringly, with an assured mastery.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The reservoir of past mental impressions, the <span class="devan">citta</span> or storehouse of memory, which must be distinguished from the specific act of memory, is the foundation on which all the other layers stand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>All experience lies within us as passive or potential memory; active memory selects and takes what it requires from that storehouse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But the active memory is like a man searching among a great mass of locked-up material: sometimes he cannot find what he wants; often in his rapid search he stumbles across many things for which he has no immediate need; often too he blunders and thinks he has found the real thing when it is something else, irrelevant if not valueless, on which he has laid his hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The passive memory or <span class="devan">citta</span> needs no training, it is automatic and naturally sufficient to its task; there is not the slightest object of knowledge coming within its field which is not secured, placed and faultlessly preserved in that admirable receptacle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is the active memory, a higher but less perfectly developed function, which is in need of improvement.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1772"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The second layer is the mind proper or <span class="devan">manas</span>, the sixth sense of our Indian psychology, in which all the others are gathered up.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The function of the mind is to receive the images of things translated into sight, sound, smell, taste and touch by the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1184" href="#">1</a> five senses and translate these again into thought-sensations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It receives also images of its own direct grasping and forms them into mental impressions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>These sensations and impressions are the material of thought, not thought itself; but it is exceedingly important that thought should work on sufficient and perfect material.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It is therefore the first business of the educationist to develop in the child the right use of the six senses, to see that they are not stunted or injured by disuse, but trained by the </p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1786"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>A very remarkable feature of modern training which has been subjected in India to a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> is the practice of teaching by snippets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>A subject is taught a little at a time, in conjunction with a host of others, with the result that what might be well learnt in a single year is badly learned in seven and the boy goes out ill-equipped, served with imperfect parcels of knowledge, master of none of the great departments of human knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The system of education adopted by the National Council, an amphibious and twy-natured creation, attempts to heighten this practice of teaching by snippets at the bottom and the middle and suddenly change it to a grandiose specialism at the top.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1787"><!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The old system was to teach one or two subjects well and thoroughly and then proceed to others, and certainly it was a more rational system than the modern.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1794"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>There are six senses which minister to knowledge, sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste, mind, and all of these except the last look outward and gather the material of thought from outside through the physical nerves and their end-organs, eye, ear, nose, skin, palate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The perfection of the senses as ministers to thought must be one of the first cares of the teacher.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The two things that are needed of the senses are accuracy and sensitiveness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We must first understand what are the obstacles to the accuracy and sensitiveness of the senses, in order that we may take the best steps to remove them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The cause of imperfection must be understood by those who desire to bring about perfection.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1795"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The senses depend for their accuracy and sensitiveness on the unobstructed activity of the nerves which are the channels of their information and the passive acceptance of the mind which is the recipient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>In themselves the organs do their work perfectly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The eye gives the right form, the ear the correct sound, the palate the right taste, the skin the right touch, the nose the right smell.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This can easily be understood if we study the action of the eye as a crucial example.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>A correct image is reproduced automatically on the retina, if there is any error in appreciating it, it is not the fault of the organ, but of something else.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1796"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The fault may be with the nerve currents.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The nerves are nothing but channels, they have no power in themselves to alter the information given by the organs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But a channel may be obstructed and the obstruction may interfere either with the fullness or the accuracy of the information, not as it reaches the organ where it is necessarily and automatically perfect, but as it reaches the mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The only exception is in case of a physical defect in the organ as an instrument.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>That is not a matter for the educationist, but for the physician.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 398</p>
<p class="PE"> If the obstruction is such as to stop the information reaching the mind at all, the result is an insufficient sensitiveness of the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The defects of sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste, anaesthesia in its various degrees, are curable when not the effect of physical injury or defect in the organ itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The obstructions can be removed and the sensitiveness remedied by the purification of the nerve system.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The remedy is a simple one which is now becoming more and more popular in Europe for different reasons and objects, the regulation of the breathing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>This process inevitably restores the perfect and unobstructed activity of the channels and, if well and thoroughly done, leads to a high activity of the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The process is called in Yogic discipline <span class="devan">nāḍī-śuddhi</span> or nerve-purification.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1798"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The obstruction in the channel may be such as not absolutely to stop in however small a degree, but to distort the information.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>All distortions due to actions in the nervous system can be traced to some kind of emotional disturbance acting in the nerve channels.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The only remedy for them is the habit of calm, the habitual steadiness of the nerves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This also can be brought about by <span class="devan">nāḍī-śuddhi</span> or nerve-purification, which quiets the system, gives a deliberate calmness to all the internal processes and prepares the purification of the mind.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1799"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>If the nerve channels are quiet and clear, the only possible disturbance of the information is from or through the mind.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1800"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>As a sense organ the mind receives direct thought impressions from outside and from within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>These impressions are in themselves perfectly correct, but in their report to the intellect they may either not reach the intellect at all or may reach it so distorted as to make a false or partially false impression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The disturbance may affect the impression which attends the information of eye, ear, nose, skin or palate, but it is very slightly powerful here.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile there is no reason why the mind should not be trained to give a correct report to the intellect so that our thought may start with absolutely correct if not with full impressions.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1801"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>The first obstacle, the nervous emotional, we may suppose to be removed by the purification of the nervous system.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The second obstacle is that of the emotions themselves warping the impression as it comes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Love may do this, hatred may do this, any emotion or desire according to its power and intensity may distort the impression as it travels.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>This difficulty can only be removed by the discipline of the emotions, the purifying of the moral habits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>This is a part of moral training and its consideration may be postponed for the moment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The next difficulty is the interference of previous associations formed or ingrained in the <span class="devan">citta</span> or passive memory.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>It is only more developed minds which can receive first impressions without an unconscious bias against the novelty of novel experience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>For instance, if we get a true impression of what is happening — and we habitually act on such impressions true or false — if it differs from what we are accustomed to expect, the old association meets it in the <span class="devan">citta</span> and sends a changed report to the intellect in which either the new impression is overlaid and concealed by the old or mingled with it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>This tamasic inertia of the receiving instruments is no doubt due to the inattention of the <span class="devan">buddhi</span>, and therefore its consideration may seem to come properly under the training of the functions of the intellect, but it is more convenient, though less psychologically correct, to notice it here.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1812"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The first qualities of the mind that have to be developed are those which can be grouped under observation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We notice some things, ignore others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Even of what we notice, we observe very little.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>A general perception of an object is all we<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1197" href="#">1</a> usually carry away from a cursory half-attentive glance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>A closer attention fixes its place, form, nature as distinct from its surroundings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Full concentration of the faculty of observation gives us all the knowledge that the three chief senses can gather about the object, or if we touch or taste, we may gather all that the five senses can tell of its nature and properties.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Those who make use of the sixth sense, the poet, the painter, the Yogin, can also gather much that is hidden from the ordinary observer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The scientist by investigation ascertains other facts open to a minuter observation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>These are the components of the faculty of observation, and it is obvious that its basis is attention, which may be only close or close and minute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We may gather much even from a passing glance at an object, if we have the habit of concentrating the attention and the habit of sattwic receptivity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The first thing the teacher has to do is to accustom the pupil to concentrate attention.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1813"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We may take the instance of a flower.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Instead of looking casually at it and getting a casual impression of scent, form and colour, he should be encouraged to know the flower — to fix in his mind the exact shade, the peculiar glow, the precise intensity of the scent, the beauty of curve and design in the form.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>His touch should assure itself of the texture and its peculiarities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Next, the flower should be taken to pieces and its structure examined with the same careful fulness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1198" href="#">2</a> of observation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>All this should be done not as a task, but as an object of interest by skilfully arranged questions suited to the learner which will draw him on to observe and investigate one thing after the other until he has </p>

<p class="PE"> almost unconsciously mastered the whole.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1814"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Memory and judgment are the next qualities that will be called upon, and they should be encouraged in the same unconscious way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The student should not be made to repeat the same lesson over again in order to remember it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>That is a mechanical, burdensome and unintelligent way of training the memory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>A similar but different flower should be put in his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1199" href="#">3</a> hands and he should be encouraged to note it with the same care, but with the avowed object of noting the similarities and differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>By this practice daily repeated the memory will naturally be trained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Not only so, but the mental centres of comparison and contrast will be developed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The learner will begin to observe as a habit the similarities of things and their differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The teacher should take every care to encourage the perfect growth of this faculty and habit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>At the same time the laws of species and genus will begin to dawn on the mind and, by a skilful following and leading of the young developing mind, the scientific habit, the scientific attitude and the fundamental facts of scientific knowledge may in a very short time be made part of its permanent equipment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The observation and comparison of flowers, leaves, plants, trees will lay the foundations of botanical knowledge without loading the mind with names and that dry set acquisition of informations which is the beginning of cramming and detested by the healthy human mind when it is fresh from nature and unspoiled by unnatural habits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>In the same way by the observation of the stars, astronomy, by the observation of the earth<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1200" href="#">4</a>, stones, etc., geology, by the observation of insects and animals, entomology and zoology may be founded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>A little later chemistry may be started by interesting observation of experiments without any formal teaching or heaping on the mind of formulas and book knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>There is no scientific subject the perfect and natural mastery of which cannot be prepared in early childhood by this training of the faculties to observe, compare, remember and judge various classes of objects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It can be done easily and attended with a supreme and absorbing interest in the mind of the student.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>At every step the boy will have to decide what is the right idea, measurement, appreciation of colour, sound, scent, etc., and what is the wrong.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Often the judgments and distinctions made will have to be exceedingly subtle and delicate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>At first many errors will be made, but the learner should be taught to trust his judgment without being attached to its results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It will be found that the judgment will soon begin to respond to the calls made on it, clear itself of all errors and begin to judge correctly and minutely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The best way is to accustom the boy to compare his judgments with those of others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>When he is wrong, it should at first be pointed out to him how far he was right and why he went wrong, afterwards he should be encouraged to note these things for himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Every time he is right, his attention should be prominently and encouragingly called to it so that he may get confidence.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1821"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The training of the logical reason must necessarily follow the training of the faculties which collect the material on which the logical reason must work.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>I see the sun rise<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1203" href="#">1</a> day after day, I conclude or induce that it rises as a law daily after a varying interval of darkness.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>I have induced that general rule from an observation of facts.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>I cannot deduce it because fire is not always created by human kindling; it may be volcanic or caused by a stroke of lightning or the sparks from some kind of friction in the neighbourhood.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1822"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>There are three elements necessary to correct reasoning, first, the correctness of the facts or conclusions I start from, secondly, the completeness as well as accuracy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1204" href="#">2</a> of the data I start from, thirdly, the elimination of other possible or impossible conclusions from the same facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The fallibility of the logical reason is due partly to avoidable negligence and looseness in securing these conditions, partly to the difficulty of getting all the facts correct, still more to the difficulty of getting all the facts complete, most of all, to the extreme difficulty of eliminating all possible conclusions except the one which happens to </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, by care and keenness the fallibility may be reduced to its minimum.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1823"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The usual practice is to train the logical reason by teaching the science of Logic.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1824"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The first step is to make the young mind interest itself in drawing inferences from the facts, tracing cause and effect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It should then be led on to notice its successes and its failures and the reason of the success and of the failure; the incorrectness of the fact started from, the haste in drawing conclusions from insufficient facts, the carelessness in accepting a conclusion which is improbable, little supported by the data or open to doubt, the indolence or prejudice which does not wish to consider other possible explanations or conclusions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>In this way the mind can be trained to reason as correctly as the fallibility of human logic will allow, minimising the chances of error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The study of formal logic should be postponed to a later time when it can easily be mastered in a very brief period, since it will be only the systematising of an art perfectly well known to the student.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1834"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The whole movement of the national life of India at the present moment may be described in one phrase, — a pressure from within towards self-liberation from all unnatural conditions which obstruct or divert its free and spontaneous development.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The effort to discover and organise a system of national education is part of this general effort of self-liberation, of self-finding, but perhaps the most central movement of all, in the end even the most important; for it is this which will give shape to the spirit of the nation at present in a state of rather formless flux.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1837"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The necessity and unmixed good of universal education has become a fixed dogma to the modern intelligence, a thing held to be beyond dispute by any liberal mind or awakened national conscience, and whether the tenet be or not altogether beyond cavil, it may at any rate be presumed that it answers to a present and imperative need of the intellectual and vital effort of the race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>But there is not quite so universal an agreement or common attainment to a reasoned or luminous idea on what education is or practically or ideally should be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Add to this uncertainty the demand — naturally insistent and clamorous with the awakening of the spirit of independence in a country like our own which is peculiarly circumstanced not only by the clash of the Asiatic and the European or occidental consciousness and the very different civilisations they have created and the enforced meeting of the English and the Indian mind and culture, but by a political subjection which has left the decisive shaping and supreme control of education in the hands of foreigners, — add the demand for a national type of education, and in the absence of clear ideas on the subject we are likely to enter, as we have in fact entered into an atmosphere of great and disconcerting confusion.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1838"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>For if we do not know very clearly what education in general truly is or should be, we seem still less to know what we mean by national education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>All that appears to be almost unanimously agreed on is that the teaching given in the existing schools and universities has been bad in kind and in addition denationalising, degrading and impoverishing to the national mind, soul and character because it is overshadowed by a foreign hand and foreign in aim, method, substance and spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But this purely negative agreement does not carry us very far: it does not tell us what in principle or practice we desire or ought to put in </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 418</p>
<p class="PE"> its place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>There may be much virtue in an epithet but to tag on the word “national” to a school or college or even a Council or Board of Education, to put that into the hands of an indigenous agency, mostly of men trained in the very system we are denouncing, to reproduce that condemned system with certain differences, additions, subtractions, modifications of detail and curriculum, to tack on a technical side and think we have solved the problem does not really change anything.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>To be satisfied with a trick of this kind is to perform a somersault round our centre of intellectual gravity, land ourselves where we were before and think we have got into quite another country, — obviously a very unsatisfactory proceeding.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The institutions that go by the new name may or may not be giving a better education than the others, but in what they are more national, is not altogether clear even to the most willingly sympathetic critical intelligence.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1839"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The problem indeed is one of surpassing difficulty and it is not easy to discover from what point of thought or of practice one has to begin, on what principle to create or on what lines to map out the new building.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The conditions are intricate and the thing that is to be created in a way entirely new.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We cannot be satisfied with a mere resuscitation of some past principle, method and system that may have happened to prevail at one time in India, however great it was or in consonance with our past civilisation and culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>That reversion would be a sterile and impossible effort hopelessly inadequate to the pressing demands of the present and the far greater demands of our future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>On the other hand to take over the English, German or American school and university or some variation on them with a gloss of Indian colour is a course attractively facile and one that saves the need of thinking and of new experiment; but in that case there is no call for this loud pother about nationalising education, all that is needed is a change of control, of the medium of instruction, of the frame and fitting of the curriculum and to some extent of the balance of subjects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>I presume that it is something more profound, great and searching that we have in mind and that, whatever the difficulty of giving it shape, it is an </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 419</p>
<p class="PE"> education proper to the Indian soul and need and temperament and culture that we are in quest of, not indeed something faithful merely to the past, but to the developing soul of India, to her future need, to the greatness of her coming self-creation, to her eternal spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is this that we have to get clear in our minds and for that we must penetrate down to fundamentals and make those firm before we can greatly execute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Otherwise nothing is easier than to start off on a false but specious cry or from an unsound starting-point and travel far away from the right path on a tangent that will lead us to no goal but only to emptiness and failure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1840"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But first let us clear out of the way or at least put in its proper place and light the preliminary disabling objection that there is and can be no meaning at all or none worth troubling about in the idea of a national education and that the very notion is the undesirable and unprofitable intrusion of a false and narrow patriotism into a field in which patriotism apart from the need of a training in good citizenship has no legitimate place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>And for that one purpose no special kind or form of education is needed, since the training to good citizenship must be in all essentials the same whether in the east or the west, England or Germany or Japan or India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Mankind and its needs are the same everywhere and truth and knowledge are one and have no country; education too must be a thing universal and without nationality or borders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>What, for an instance, could be meant by a national education in Science, and does it signify that we are to reject modern truth and modern method of science because they come to us from Europe and go back to the imperfect scientific knowledge of classical India, exile Galileo and Newton and all that came after and teach only what was known to Bhaskara, Aryabhatta and Varahamihira?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Or how should the teaching of Sanskrit or the living indigenous tongues differ in kind and method from the teaching of Latin or the living modern tongues in Europe?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Are we then to fetch back to the methods of the tols of Nadiya or to the system, if we can find out what it was, practised in ancient Takshashila or Nalanda?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>At most what can be demanded is a larger place for </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 420</p>
<p class="PE"> the study of the past of our country, the replacement of English by the indigenous tongues as a medium and the relegation of the former to the position of a second language, — but it is possible to challenge the advisability even of these changes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>After all we live in the twentieth century and cannot revive the India of Chandragupta or Akbar; we must keep abreast with the march of truth and knowledge, fit ourselves for existence under actual circumstances, and our education must be therefore up to date in form and substance and modern in life and spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1841"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>All these objections are only pertinent if directed against the travesty of the idea of national education which would make of it a means of an obscurantist retrogression to the past forms that were once a living frame of our culture but are now dead or dying things; but that is not the idea nor the endeavour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The living spirit of the demand for national education no more requires a return to the astronomy and mathematics of Bhaskara or the forms of the system of Nalanda than the living spirit of Swadeshi a return from railway and motor traction to the ancient chariot and the bullock-cart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>There is no doubt plenty of retrogressive sentimentalism about and there have been some queer violences on common sense and reason and disconcerting freaks that prejudice the real issue, but these inconsequent streaks of fantasy give a false hue to the matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is the spirit, the living and vital issue that we have to do with, and there the question is not between modernism and antiquity, but between an imported civilisation and the greater possibilities of the Indian mind and nature, not between the present and the past, but between the present and the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It is not a return to the fifth century but an initiation of the centuries to come, not a reversion but a break forward away from a present artificial falsity to her own greater innate potentialities that is demanded by the soul, by the Shakti of India.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1842"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The argument against national education proceeds in the first place upon the lifeless academic notion that the subject, the acquiring of this or that kind of information is the whole or the central matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But the acquiring of various kinds of information is only one and not the chief of the means and necessities of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 421</p>
<p class="PE"> education: its central aim is the building of the powers of the human mind and spirit, it is the formation or, as I would prefer to view it, the evoking of knowledge and will and of the power to use knowledge, character, culture, — that at least if no more.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>And this distinction makes an enormous difference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is true enough that if all we ask for is the acquisition of the information put at our disposal by science, it may be enough to take over the science of the West whether in an undigested whole or in carefully packed morsels.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But the major question is not merely what science we learn, but what we shall do with our science and how too, acquiring the scientific mind and recovering the habit of scientific discovery — I leave aside the possibility of the Indian mentality working freely in its own nature discovering new methods or even giving a new turn to physical science — we shall relate it to other powers of the human mind and scientific knowledge, to other knowledge more intimate to other and not less light-giving and power-giving parts of our intelligence and nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>And there the peculiar cast of the Indian mind, its psychological tradition, its ancestral capacity, turn, knowledge bring in cultural elements of a supreme importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>A language, Sanskrit or another, should be acquired by whatever method is most natural, efficient and stimulating to the mind and we need not cling there to any past or present manner of teaching: but the vital question is how we are to learn and make use of Sanskrit and the indigenous languages so as to get to the heart and intimate sense of our own culture and establish a vivid continuity between the still living power of our past and the yet uncreated power of our future, and how we are to learn and use English or any other foreign tongue so as to know helpfully the life, ideas and culture of other countries and establish our right relations with the world around us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>This is the aim and principle of a true national education, not, certainly, to ignore modern truth and knowledge, but to take our foundation on our own being, our own mind, our own spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1843"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The second ground openly or tacitly taken by the hostile argument is that modern, that is to say, European civilisation is the thing that we have to acquire and fit ourselves for, so only </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 422</p>
<p class="PE"> can we live and prosper and it is this that our education must do for us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The idea of national education challenges the sufficiency of this assumption.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Europe built up her ancient culture on a foundation largely taken from the East, from Egypt, Chaldea, Phoenicia, India, but turned in a new direction and another life-idea by the native spirit and temperament, mind and social genius of Greece and Rome, lost and then recovered it, in part from the Arabs with fresh borrowings from the near East and from India and more widely by the Renaissance, but then too gave it a new turn and direction proper to the native spirit and temperament, mind and social genius of the Teutonic, and the Latin, the Celtic and Slav races.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>It is the civilisation so created that has long offered itself as the last and imperative word of the mind of humanity, but the nations of Asia are not bound so to accept it, and will do better, taking over in their turn whatever new knowledge or just ideas Europe has to offer, to assimilate them to their own knowledge and culture, their own native temperament and spirit, mind and social genius and out of that create the civilisation of the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The scientific, rationalistic, industrial, pseudo-democratic civilisation of the West is now in process of dissolution and it would be a lunatic absurdity for us at this moment to build blindly on that sinking foundation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>When the most advanced minds of the occident are beginning to turn in this red evening of the West for the hope of a new and more spiritual civilisation to the genius of Asia, it would be strange if we could think of nothing better than to cast away our own self and potentialities and put our trust in the dissolving and moribund past of Europe.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1844"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>And, finally, the objection grounds itself on the implicit idea that the mind of man is the same everywhere and can everywhere be passed through the same machine and uniformly constructed to order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>That is an old and effete superstition of the reason which it is time now to renounce.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1847"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>These preliminary objections made to the very idea of national education and, incidentally, the misconceptions they oppose once out of the way, we have still to formulate more positively what the idea means to us, the principle and the form that national education must take in India, the thing to be achieved and the method and turn to be given to the endeavour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is here that the real difficulty begins because we have for a long time, not only in education but in almost all things, in our whole cultural life, lost hold of the national spirit and idea and there has been as yet no effort of clear, sound and deep thinking or seeing which would enable us to recover it and therefore no clear agreement or even clear difference of opinion on essentials and accessories.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>At the most we have been satisfied with a strong sentiment and a general but shapeless idea and enthusiasm corresponding to the sentiment and have given to it in the form whatever haphazard application chanced to be agreeable to our intellectual associations, habits or caprices.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The result has been no tangible or enduring success, but rather a maximum of confusion and failure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The first thing needed is to make clear to our own minds what the national spirit, temperament, idea, need demands of us through education and apply it in its right harmony to all the different elements of the problem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Only after that is done can we really hope with some confidence and chance of utility and success to replace the present false, empty and mechanical education by something better than a poor and futile chaos or a new mechanical falsity, by a real, living and creative upbringing of the Indian manhood of the future.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1848"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But first it is necessary to disengage from all ambiguities what we understand by a true education, its essential sense, its fundamental aim and significance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>For we can then be sure of our </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 425</p>
<p class="PE"> beginnings and proceed securely to fix the just place and whole bearing of the epithet we seek to attach to the word.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>I must be sure what education itself is or should be before I can be sure what a national education is or should be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Let us begin then with our initial statement, as to which I think there can be no great dispute that there are three things which have to be taken into account in a true and living education, the man, the individual in his commonness and in his uniqueness, the nation or people and universal humanity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It follows that that alone will be a true and living education which helps to bring out to full advantage, makes ready for the full purpose and scope of human life all that is in the individual man, and which at the same time helps him to enter into his right relation with the life, mind and soul of the people to which he belongs and with that great total life, mind and soul of humanity of which he himself is a unit and his people or nation a living, a separate and yet inseparable member.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is by considering the whole question in the light of this large and entire principle that we can best arrive at a clear idea of what we would have our education to be and what we shall strive to accomplish by a national education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Most is this largeness of view and foundation needed here and now in India, the whole energy of whose life purpose must be at this critical turning of her destinies directed to her one great need, to find and rebuild her true self in individual and in people and to take again, thus repossessed of her inner greatness, her due and natural portion and station in the life of the human race.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1849"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>There are however very different conceptions possible of man and his life, of the nation and its life and of humanity and the life of the human race, and our idea and endeavour in education may well vary considerably according to that difference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>India has always had her own peculiar conception and vision of these things and we must see whether it is not really, as it is likely to be, that which will be or ought to be at the very root of our education and the one thing that will give it its truly national character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Man has not been seen by the thought of India as a living body developed by physical Nature which has evolved certain vital propensities, an ego, a mind and a reason, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 426</p>
<p class="PE"> an animal of the genus homo and in our case of the species <i>homo indicus</i>, whose whole life and education must be turned towards a satisfaction of these propensities under the government of a trained mind and reason and for the best advantage of the personal and the national ego.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It has not been either the turn of her mind to regard man preeminently as a reasoning animal, or let us say, widening the familiar definition, a thinking, feeling and willing natural existence, a mental son of physical Nature, and his education as a culture of the mental capacities, or to define him as a political, social and economic being and his education as a training that will fit him to be an efficient, productive and well disciplined member of the society and the State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>All these are no doubt aspects of the human being and she has given them a considerable prominence subject to her larger<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1208" href="#">1</a> vision, but they are outward things, parts of the instrumentation of his mind, life and action, not the whole or the real man.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1850"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>India has seen always in man the individual a soul, a portion of the Divinity enwrapped in mind and body, a conscious manifestation in Nature of the universal self and spirit.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1865"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We now come to the kernel of the subject, the place of art in the evolution of the race and its value in the education and actual life of a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The first question is whether the sense of the beautiful has any effect on the life of a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is obvious, from what we have already written, that the manners, the social culture and the restraint in action and expression which are so large a part of national prestige and dignity and make a nation admired like the French, loved like the Irish or respected like the higher-class English, are based essentially on the sense of form and beauty, of what is correct, symmetrical, well-adjusted, fair to the eye and pleasing to the imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The absence of these qualities is a source of national weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The rudeness, coarseness and vulgar violence of the less cultured Englishman, the overbearing brusqueness and selfishness of the Prussian have greatly hampered those powerful nations in their dealings with foreigners, dependencies and even their own friends, allies, colonies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We all know what a large share the manner and ordinary conduct of the average and of the vulgar Anglo-Indian has had in bringing about the revolt of the Indian, accustomed through ages<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1229" href="#">1</a> to courtesy, dignity and the amenities of an equal intercourse, against the mastery of an obviously coarse and selfish community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Now the sense of form and beauty, the correct, symmetrical, well-adjusted, fair and pleasing is an artistic sense and can best be fostered in a nation by artistic culture of the perceptions and sensibilities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is noteworthy that the two great nations who are most hampered by the defect of these qualities in action are also the least imaginative, poetic and artistic in Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is the South German who contributes the art, poetry and music of Germany, the Celt and Norman who produce great poets and a few great artists in England without altering the characteristics of the dominant </p>

<p class="PE"> Saxon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Music is even more powerful in this direction than Art and by the perfect expression of harmony insensibly<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1230" href="#">2</a> steeps the man in it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>And it is noticeable that England has hardly produced a single musician worth the name.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Plato in his Republic has dwelt with extraordinary emphasis on the importance of music in education; as is the music to which a people is accustomed, so, he says in effect, is the character of that people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The importance of painting and sculpture is hardly less.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The mind is profoundly influenced by what it sees and, if the eye is trained from the days of childhood to the contemplation and understanding of beauty, harmony and just arrangement in line and colour, the tastes, habits and character will be insensibly trained to follow a similar law of beauty, harmony and just arrangement in the life of the adult man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This was the great importance of the universal proficiency in the arts and crafts or the appreciation of them which was prevalent in ancient Greece, in certain European ages, in Japan and in the better days of our own history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Art galleries cannot be brought into every home, but, if all the appointments of our life and furniture of our homes are things of taste and beauty, it is inevitable that the habits, thoughts and feelings of the people should be raised, ennobled, harmonised<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1231" href="#">3</a>, made more sweet and dignified.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1866"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>A similar result is produced on the emotions by the study of beautiful or noble art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We have spoken of the purification of the heart, the <span class="devan">cittaśuddhi</span>, which Aristotle assigned as the essential office of poetry, and have pointed out that it is done in poetry by the detached and disinterested enjoyment of the eight <span class="devan">rasas</span> or forms of emotional aestheticism which make up life, unalloyed by the disturbance of the lower self-regarding passions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Painting and sculpture work in the same direction by different means.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Art sometimes uses the same means as poetry but cannot do it to the same extent because it has not the movement of poetry; it is fixed, still, it expresses only a given moment, a given point in space and cannot move freely through time and region.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But it is precisely this stillness, this calm, this fixity which gives its separate value to Art.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1868"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The value of art in the training of intellectual faculty is also an important part of its utility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We have already indicated the double character of intellectual activity, divided between the imaginative, creative and sympathetic or comprehensive intellectual centres on the one side and the critical, analytic and penetrative on the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The latter are best trained by science, criticism and observation, the former by art, poetry, music, literature and the sympathetic study of man and his creations.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Art assists in this training by raising images in the mind which it has to understand not by analysis, but by self-identification with other minds; it is a powerful stimulator of sympathetic insight.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Art is subtle and delicate, and it makes the mind also in its movements subtle and delicate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It is suggestive, and the intellect habituated to the appreciation of art is quick to catch suggestions, mastering not only, as the scientific mind does, that which is positive and on the surface, but that which leads to ever fresh widening and subtilising of knowledge and opens a door into the deeper secrets of inner nature where the positive instruments of science cannot take the depth or measure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>This supreme intellectual value of Art has never been sufficiently recognised<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1234" href="#">1</a>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The impulse, denied proper training and self-purification, has spent itself on the trivial, gaudy, sensuous, cheap or vulgar instead of helping man upward by its powerful aid<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1236" href="#">3</a> in the evocation of what is best and highest in intellect as well as in character, emotion and the aesthetic enjoyment and regulation of life and manners.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>European critics have dwelt on the close connection of the highest developments of art with religion, and it is undoubtedly true that in Greece, in Italy, in India, the greatest efflorescence of a national Art has been associated with the employment of the artistic genius to illustrate or adorn the thoughts and fancies or the temples and instruments of the national religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This was not because Art is necessarily associated with the outward forms of religion, but because it was in the religion that men’s spiritual aspirations centred<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1237" href="#">4</a> themselves.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Spirituality is a single word expressive of three lines of human aspiration towards divine knowledge, divine love and joy, divine strength, and that will be the highest and most perfect Art which, while satisfying the physical requirements of the aesthetic sense, the laws of formal beauty, the emotional demand of humanity, the portrayal of life and outward reality, as the best European Art satisfies these requirements, reaches beyond them and expresses inner spiritual truth, the deeper not obvious reality of things, the joy of God in the world and its beauty and desirableness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1238" href="#">5</a> and the manifestation of divine force and energy in phenomenal creation.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1878"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Modern Review</i> and <i>Prabasi</i> are doing monthly a service to the country the importance of which cannot be exaggerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The former review is at present the best conducted and the most full of valuable matter of any in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>But good as are the articles which fill the magazine from month to month, the whole sum of them is outweighed in value by the single page which gives us the reproduction of some work of art by a contemporary Indian painter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>To the lover of beauty and the lover of his country every one of these delicately executed blocks is an event of importance in his life within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The reviews by bringing these masterpieces to the thousands who have no opportunity of seeing the originals are restoring the sense of beauty and artistic emotion inborn in our race but almost blotted out by the long reign in our lives of the influence of Anglo-Saxon vulgarity and crude tasteless commercialism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The pictures belong usually to the new school of Bengali art, the only living and original school now developing among us and the last issues have each contained a picture — especially important not only by the intrinsic excellence of the work but by the perfect emergence of that soul of India which we attempted to characterise in an article in our second issue.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1246" href="#">1</a><!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1879"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The picture in the July number is by Mahomed Hakim Khan, a student of the Government School of Art, Calcutta, and represents Nadir Shah ordering a general massacre.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is not one of those pictures salient and imposing which leap at once at the eye and hold it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>A first glance only shows three figures almost conventionally Indian in poses which also seem conventional.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 456</p>
<p class="PE"> But as one looks again and again the soul of the picture begins suddenly to emerge, and one realises with a start of surprise that one is in the presence of a work of genius.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The reason for this lies in the extraordinary restraint and simplicity which conceals the artist’s strength and subtlety<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1247" href="#">2</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The whole spirit and conception is Indian and it would be difficult to detect in the composition a single trace of foreign influence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The grace and perfection of the design and the distinctness and vigour of form which support it are not European; it is the Saracenic sweetness and grace, the old Vedantic massiveness and power transformed by some new nameless element of harmony into something original and yet Indian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The careful and minute detail in the minutiae of the dresses, of the armour of the warrior seated on the right, of the flickering lines of the pillar on the left are inherited from an intellectual ancestry whose daily vision was accustomed to the rich decoration of Agra and Fatehpur Sikri or to the fullness and crowded detail which informed the massive work of the old Vedantic artists and builders, Hindu, Jain and Buddhist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Another peculiarity is the fixity and stillness which, in spite of the Titanic life and promise of motion in the figure of Nadir, pervade the picture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>A certain stiffness of design marks much of the old Hindu art, a stiffness courted by the artists perhaps in order that no insistence of material life in the figures might distract attention from the expression of the spirit within which was their main object.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>By some inspiration of genius the artist has transformed this conventional stiffness into a hint of rigidity which almost suggests the lines of stone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>This stillness adds immensely to the effect of the picture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The petrified inaction of the three human beings contrasted with the expression of the faces and the formidable suggestion in the pose of their sworded figures affects us like the silence of murder crouching for his leap.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1880"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The central figure of Nadir Shah dominates his surroundings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is from this centre that the suggestion of something terrible coming out of the silent group has started.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The strong, proud and regal figure is extraordinarily impressive, but it is the face and the arm that give the individuality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>That bare arm and hand grasping the rigid upright scimitar are inhuman in </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This arm and hand have action, murder, empire in them: the whole history of Nadir is there expressed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The grip and gesture have already commenced the coming massacre and the whole body behind consents.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The face corresponds in the hard firmness and strength of the nose, the brute cruelty of the mouth almost lost in the moustache and beard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But the eyes are the master-touch in this figure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>They overcome us with surprise when we look at them, for these are not the eyes of the assassin, even the assassin upon the throne.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The soul that looks out of these eyes is calm, aloof and thoughtful, yet terrible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Whatever order of massacre has issued from these lips, did not go forth from an ordinary energetic man of action moved by self-interest, rage or blood-thirst.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The eyes are the eyes of a Yogin but a terrible Yogin; such might be the look of some adept of the left-hand ways, some mighty Kapalik lifted above pity and shrinking as above violence and wrath.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Those eyes in that face, over that body, arm, hand seem to be those of one whose spirit is not affected by the actions of the body, whose natural part and organs are full of the destroying energy of Kali while the soul, the witness within, looks on at the sanguinary drama tranquil, darkly approving but hardly interested.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>And then it dawns on one that this is not so much the Nadir of history; unconsciously perhaps the artist has given a quiet but effective delineation of the Scourge of God, the man who is rather a force than a human being, the Asura with a mission who has come to do God’s work of destruction and help on the evolution by carnage and ruin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The soul within is not that of a human being.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Some powerful Yogin of a Lemurian race has incarnated in this body, one born when the simian might and strength of the <span class="devan">vānara</span> had evolved into the perfection of the human form and brain with the animal still uneliminated, who having by tapasya and knowledge separated his soul from his nature has elected this reward that after long beatitude, <span class="devan">prāpya puṇyakṛtāṃ lokān uṣitvā śāśvatīḥ samāḥ</span>, he should reincarnate as a force of nature informed by a human soul and work out in a single life the savage strength of the outward self, taking upon <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> himself the foreordained burden of empire and massacre.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1881"><!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>From Nadir the coming carnage has passed into the seated warrior and looks out from his eyes at the receiver of the order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The gaze is contemplative but not inward like Nadir’s, and it is human and indifferent envisaging massacre as part of the activities of the soldier with a matter-of-fact approval.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The figure is almost a piece of sculpture, so perfect is the rigidity of arrested and expectant action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The straight strong sword over the shoulder has the same rigid preparedness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>There is a certain defect in the unnatural pose and obese curve of the hand which is not justified by any similar detail or motive in the rest of the figure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We notice a similar motiveless strain in the position of Nadir’s left arm, though here something is perhaps added to the force of the attitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>A standing figure receives the sanguinary command.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The folded hands and the scimitar suspended in front are full of the spirit of ready obedience and there is an expression of pleasure, almost amusement which makes even this commonplace face terrible, for the decree dooming thousands is taken as lightly as if it were order for nautch or banquet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The three mighty swords, by a masterly effect of balanced design, fill with death and menace the terrace on which the men are seated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Behind these formidable figures is a part of the palace gracious with the simple and magical lines of Indo-Saracenic architecture and in the distance on the right from behind a mass of heavy impenetrable green a slender tapering tower rises into the peaceful quiet of Delhi.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE"> delicacy of the landscape behind and the tree under which the dreamer lies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>There is suggestion but it is the suggestion of more and more beauty, there is harmony and relation but it is the harmony and relation of loveliness of landscape as a background to the loveliness of the nobly-grouped figures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>There is an attempt to express spiritual meanings but it is by outward symbols only and not by making the outward expression a vehicle for something that comes from within and overpowers impalpably.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Ramananda Chatterji.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Ramananda Babu is well known to the Bengali public as a clear-minded, sober and fearless political speaker and writer; as editor of the <i>Modern Review</i> and the <i>Prabasi</i> he has raised the status and quality of Indian periodical literature to an extraordinary extent, and has recently been doing a yet more valuable and lasting service to his country by introducing the masterpieces of the new school of Art to his readers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>His present venture is not in itself an ambitious one, as it purports only to provide a well-printed and beautifully illustrated edition of Krittibas for family reading.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>With this object the editor has taken the Battala prints of the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1251" href="#">3</a> as his text and reproduced them with the necessary corrections and the omission of a few passages which offend modern ideas of decorum.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Besides, the book is liberally illustrated with reproductions of recent pictures by artists of Bombay and Calcutta on subjects chosen from the Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1252" href="#">4</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1886"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The place of Krittibas in our literature is well established.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>He is one of the most considerable of our old classics and one of the writers who most helped to create the Bengali language as a literary instrument.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The sweetness, simplicity, lucidity, melody of the old language is present in every line that Krittibas wrote, but, in this recension at least, we miss the racy vigour and nervous vernacular force which was a gift of the early writers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Our impression is that the modern editions do not faithfully reproduce the old classic and that copyists of more learning and puristic taste than critical imagination or poetical sympathy have polished away much that was best in the Bengali Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1253" href="#">5</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The old copies, we believe, reveal a style much more irregular </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 461</p>
<p class="PE"> in diction and metre, but more full of humanity, strength and the rough and natural touch of the soil.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In no case can our Ramayan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1254" href="#">6</a> compare with the great epic of Tulsidas, that mine of poetry, strong and beautiful thought and description and deep spiritual force and sweetness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But it must have been greater in its original form than in its modern dress.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1887"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The great value of the edition lies however in the illustrations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>All the pictures are not excellent; indeed we must say quite frankly that some of them are an offence to the artistic perceptions and an affliction to the eye and the soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Others are masterpieces of the first rank.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But in this collection of pictures, most of them now well-known, we have a sort of handy record of the progress of Art in India in recent times.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Turning over the pages we are struck first by the numerous reproductions of Ravivarma’s pictures which were only recently so prominent in Indian houses and, even now, are painfully common, and we recall with wonder the time when we could gaze upon these crude failures without an immediate revolt of all that was artistic within us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Could anything be more gross, earthy, un-Indian and addressed purely to the eye than his “Descent of Ganges”, or more vulgar and unbeautiful than the figure of Aja in the “Death of Indumati”, or more soulless and commonplace than the “Ahalya”, a picture on a level with the ruck of the most ordinary European paintings for the market by obscure hands?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Some of these efforts are absolutely laughable in the crudeness of their conception and the inefficiency of their execution; take for instance the fight between Ravan and Jatayu.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Raja Rukmangad’s “Ekadashi” is one of the few successes, but spirited as the work undoubtedly is, it is so wholly an imitation of European workmanship that it establishes no claim to real artistic faculty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>All that can be said for this painter is that he turned the Indian mind to our own mythology and history for the subject of art, and that he manifests a certain struggling towards outward beauty and charm which is occasionally successful in his women and children.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But he had neither the power to develop original conceptions, nor the skill to reproduce finely that which he tried to learn from Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>He represents in Art that dark period when, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 462</p>
<p class="PE"> in subjection to foreign teaching and ideals, we did everything badly because we did everything slavishly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>It is fortunate that the representative of this period was a man without genius: otherwise he might have done infinitely more permanent harm to our taste than he has done.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1888"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The art of Sj. M.V. Durandhar shows a great advance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The basis is European but we see something Indian and characteristic struggling to express itself in this foreign mould.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Unlike Ravivarma Sj. Durandhar has always a worthy and often poetic conception, even when he fails to express it in line and colour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>In the stillness and thoughtfulness of the figures in the second illustration of the book there is a hint of the divine presence which is suggested, and Indian richness, massiveness and dignity support this great suggestion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>There is augustness and beauty in the picture of Rama and Sita about to enter Guhyaka’s boat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Others of his pictures are less successful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Another intermediate worker in the field who is very largely represented, is Sj. Upendra Kishore Ray.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>This artist has an essentially imitative genius whose proper field lies in reproduction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>There are attempts here to succeed in the European style and others which seek to capture the secret of the new school, especially where it is original, strange and remote in its greatness; but these are secrets of original genius which do not yield themselves to imitation and the attempt, though it reproduces some of the mannerisms of the school, often ends merely in grotesqueness of line and conception.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1889"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We have not left ourselves the space to do justice to the really great art represented in the book, the wonderful suggestions of the landscape<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1255" href="#">7</a> in Sj. Abanindranath Tagore’s “Slaying of the Enchanted Deer”, the decorative beauty of the “Last Days of Dasarath”, and the epic grandeur and grace and strange romantic mystery of “Mahadev receiving the Descent of the Ganges”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>We would only suggest to the readers whose artistic perceptions are awakened but in need of training, to use the comparative method for which Sj. Ramananda Chatterji has supplied plentiful materials in this book; for instance, the three illustrations of the Kaikayi and Manthara incident which are given one after the other, — Sj. Nandalal Bose’s original and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 463</p>
<p class="PE"> suggestive though not entirely successful picture, Sj. Durandhar’s vigorous and character-revealing but too imitatively European work, and Sj. U. Ray’s attempt to master the new style with its striking evidence of a great reproductive faculty but small success where originality is the aim.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Finally, let him look at the few examples of old art in the book, then at the work of the new school, especially the two pictures against page 22, and last at Raja Ravivarma’s failures.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Revival of Indian Art</h1>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->The Main Difference</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1892"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The greatness of Indian art is the greatness of all Indian thought and achievement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It lies in the recognition of the persistent within the transient, of the domination of matter by spirit, the subordination of the insistent appearances of Prakriti to the inner reality which, in a thousand ways, the Mighty Mother veils even while she suggests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The European artist, cabined within the narrow confines of the external, is dominated in imagination by the body of things and the claims of the phenomenon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Western painting starts from the eye or the imagination; its master word is either beauty or reality, and, according as he is the slave of his eye or the playfellow of his imagination, the painter produces a photograph or a poem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But, in painting, the European imagination seldom travels beyond an imaginative interpretation or variation of what the physical eye has seen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Imitation is the key-word of creation, according to Aristotle; Shakespeare advises the artist to hold up the mirror to Nature; and the Greek scientist and the English poet reflect accurately the mind of Europe.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1893"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>But the Indian artist has been taught by his philosophy and the spiritual discipline of his forefathers that the imagination is only a channel and an instrument of some source of knowledge and inspiration that is greater and higher; by meditation or by Yoga he seeks within himself that ultimate centre of knowledge where there is direct and utter vision of the thing that lies hidden in the forms of man, animal, tree, river, mountain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is this <span class="devan">samyag jñāna</span>, this <span class="devan">sākṣād darśana</span>, the utter, revealing and apocalyptic vision, that he seeks, and when he has found it, whether by patient receptivity or sudden inspiration, his whole aim is </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 465</p>
<p class="PE"> to express it utterly and revealingly in line and colour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Form is only a means of expressing the spirit, and the one thought of the artist should be how best to render the spiritual vision.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>He is not bound by the forms that compose the world of gross matter, though he takes them as a starting-point for his formal expression of the vision within him; if by modifying them or departing from them he can reveal that vision more completely, his freedom and his duty as an artist emancipate him from the obligation of the mere recorder and copyist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The ancient Asiatic artists were not incapable of reproducing outward Nature with as perfect and vigorous an accuracy as the Europeans; but it was their ordinary method deliberately to suppress all that might hamper the expression of their spiritual vision.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1894"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Reality for its own sake, one of the most dominant notes of Art in Europe, Indian artistic theory would not have recognised; for we have always regarded the reality of the Europeans as an appearance; to us the true reality is that which is hidden; otherwise, there would be no need of the prophet, the philosopher, the poet and the artist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It is they who see with the <span class="devan">sūkṣma dṛṣṭi</span>, the inner vision, and not like the ordinary man with the eye only.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Beauty for beauty’s sake, the other great note of European Art is recognised by us, but not in the higher work of the artist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Just as in the first ideal, the tyranny of the eye is acknowledged, so in the second the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1256" href="#">1</a> tyranny of the aesthetic imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The Indian seeks freedom, and the condition of freedom is the search for ultimate Truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But in this search the imagination is an unsafe and capricious guide; it misinterprets as often as it interprets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The claim of the eye to separate satisfaction can only be answered by the response of decorative beauty; the claim of the imagination to separate satisfaction can only receive the response of fancy playing with scene and legend, form and colour, idea and dream, for pure aesthetic delight; but in the interpretation of things the eye and the imagination can assert no right to command, they are only subordinate instruments and must keep their place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Whenever, therefore, the Indian artist put away from him his high spiritual aim, it was to seek decorative beauty informed by the play of the imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Here he held decorative beauty to be </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 466</p>
<p class="PE"> his paramount aim and declined to be bound by the seen and the familiar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If by other lines than the natural, by subtler or richer methods than those of outward Nature, our old masters could gain in decorative suggestion and beauty, they held themselves free to follow their inspiration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Here, too, they often deliberately changed and suppressed in order to get their desired effect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If they had been asked to deny themselves this artistic gain for the sake of satisfying the memory in the physical eye, they would have held the objector to be the bondslave of an unmeaning superstition.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1895"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>We of today have been overpowered by the European tradition as interpreted by the English, the least artistic of civilised nations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We have therefore come to make on a picture the same demand as on a photograph, — the reproduction of the thing as the eye sees it, not even as the retrospective mind or the imagination sees it, exact resemblance to the beings or objects we know, or, if anything more, then a refinement on Nature in the direction of greater picturesqueness and prettiness and the satisfaction of the lower and more external sense of beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The conception that Art exists not to copy, but for the sake of a deeper truth and vision, and we must seek in it not the object but God in the object, not things but the soul of things, seems to have vanished for a while from the Indian consciousness.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1896"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Another obstacle to the appreciation of great art, to which even those Indians who are not dominated by European ideas are liable, is the exaggerated respect for the symbols and traditions which our art or literature has used at a certain stage of development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>I am accustomed for instance to a particular way of representing Shiva or Kali and I refuse to have any other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But the artist has nothing to do with my prejudices.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>He has to represent the essential truth of Shiva or Kali, that which makes their Shivahood or Kalihood, and he is under no obligation to copy the vision of others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>If he has seen another vision of Shiva or Kali, it is that vision to which he must be faithful.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The curious discussion which arose recently as to the propriety or otherwise of representing the gods without beard or moustache, is an instance of this literalism which is a survival of the enslavement </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 467</p>
<p class="PE"> to form and rule characteristic of the eighteenth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The literalist cannot see that it is not the moustache or beard or the symbol which makes the godhead, but the divine greatness, immortal strength, beauty, youth, purity or peace within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It is that godhead which the artist must draw and paint, and in the forms he chooses he is bound only by the vision in <span class="devan">dhyāna</span>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Whether his interpretation will gain an abiding place in the thought and imagination of the race, depends on its power to awake the deeper vision in the race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>All that we can demand is that it shall be a real God, a real Shiva, a real Kali, and not a freak of his imagination or an outcome of some passing <span class="devan">saṃskāra</span> of his education or artistic upbringing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>He must go to the fountainhead of knowledge within himself or his claim to freedom does not stand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It has already been said that the condition of freedom is the search for truth, and the artist must not allow his imagination to take the place of the higher quality.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 1897"><!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Indian Art demands of the artist the power of communion with the soul of things, the sense of spiritual taking precedence of the sense of material beauty, and fidelity to the deeper vision within; of the lover of art it demands the power to see the spirit in things, the openness of mind to follow a developing tradition, and the sattwic passivity, discharged of prejudgments, which opens luminously to the secret intention of the picture and is patient to wait until it attains a perfect and profound divination.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Unsupported by a single competent voice, universally condemned by critics of eminence Asiatic and European, replaced by a style of Art national, noble and suggestive, it is as hopeless to revive this grand debaser of Indian taste and artistic culture as to restore life to the slain.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The writer is not richly endowed either with artistic taste, logical faculty or correct English; but he possesses in compensation a trenchant though ill-inspired manner of writing, and excels in that Rooseveltian style of argument which by its very commonness and doubtful taste imposes on minds imperfectly instructed in the subject of dispute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It may be necessary, in the present state of Art appreciation in India, to counteract the possible evil that may be done by even so insufficient an apology for the Goliath of artistic Philistinism in India.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Against Sister Nivedita he does not vent his spleen unguardedly, though he cannot refrain from vindicating his superiority by patronisingly describing her as “the good Sister Nivedita”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But towards Dr. Coomaraswamy, possibly because he is an Indian like the writer himself, he seems to think himself entitled to be as offensive as he chooses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>He gets rid of the Doctor’s acknowledged authority by introducing him as “a Geologist”, and emphasizes the spirit of this introduction by sprinkling his pages with similar phrases, “the Geologist”, “the Doctor”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The intention seems to be to represent Dr. Coomaraswamy as an unknown man without credit in other countries who is trying to pass himself off as an authority in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It is possible the disciple of Ravi Varma holds this view; if so, one can only wonder what Himalayan cave of meditation has been his cloister in the last few years of his existence!<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In this matter we find them, — when they can be got to think clearly on the matter at all, which is itself unusual, — divided in opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Sometimes they use it as equivalent to a set of beliefs, sometimes as equivalent to morality, coupled with a belief in God, sometimes as equivalent to a set of pietistic actions and emotions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Faith, works and pious observances, these are the three recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1299" href="#">1</a> elements of European religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>From works, however, the ordinary work of the world is strictly excluded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Religion and daily life are, in the European opinion, two entirely different things which it is superstitious, barbarous, unenlightened and highly inconvenient to mix up together.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Altruistic works are sometimes brought under religion, sometimes excluded from it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The idea of knowledge being part of religion is a conception which the European cannot receive into his intellect; religion and knowledge are to him two things absolutely and eternally unconnected, if not opposed and mutually contradictory of each other.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The average Christian believes that the Bible is God’s book, but ordinarily he does not consider anything in God’s book binding on him in practice except to believe in God and go to Church once a week; the rest is only meant for the exceptionally pious.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>On the whole, therefore, to believe in God, to believe that He wrote a book, — only one book in all these ages, — and to go to Church on Sunday is the minimum of religion in Europe; on these essentials piety and morality may supervene and deepen the meaning.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2050"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Religion in India is a still more plastic term and may mean anything from the heights of Yoga to strangling your fellow man and relieving him of the worldly goods he may happen to be carrying with him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It would therefore take too long to enumerate everything that can be included in Indian religion.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>In practice this resolves itself into certain observances and social customs of which he understands neither the spiritual meaning nor the practical utility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>To venerate the Scriptures without knowing them and to obey custom in their place; to reverence all Brahmins whether they are venerable or despicable; to eat nothing cooked by a social inferior; to marry one’s daughter before puberty and one’s son as soon as possible after it; to keep women ignorant and domestically useful; to bathe scrupulously and go through certain fixed ablutions; to eat on the floor and not at a table; to do one’s devotions twice a day without understanding them; to observe a host of meaningless minutiae<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1301" href="#">2</a> in one’s daily conduct; to keep the Hindu holidays, when an image is set up, worshipped and thrown away, — this in India is the minimum of religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>This is glorified as Hinduism and the Sanatana Dharma.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>If, in addition, a man has emotional or ecstatic piety, he is a Bhakta; if he can talk fluently about the Veda, Upanishads, Darshanas and Puranas, he is a Jnani.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>When he rises above the body, he abandons Hathayoga as a troublesome and inferior process and rises to the Rajayoga, the discipline peculiar to the aeon in which man now evolves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The first condition of success in Rajayoga is to rise superior to the dehatmak bodh<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1446" href="#">1</a>, the state of perception in which the body is identified with the self.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>A time comes to the Rajayogin when his body seems not to belong to him or he to have any concern with<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1447" href="#">2</a> it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>He is not troubled by its troubles or gladdened by its pleasures<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1448" href="#">3</a>; it has them to itself<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1449" href="#">4</a> and very soon, because he does not give his sanction to them, they fall away from it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>His own troubles and pleasures are in the heart and mind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1450" href="#">5</a>, for he is the rajasic and psychical man, not the tamasic material.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It is these that he has to conquer in order that he may realise God in his heart or in his buddhi or in both.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>God seen in the heart, that is the quest of the Rajayogin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>He may recover the perception and enjoyment of the body afterwards, but it is only to help the enjoyment of God<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1451" href="#">6</a> as Love and God as Knowledge.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2082"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The processes of the Rajayoga are mental and emotional.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Patanjali’s science is not the pure Rajayoga; it is mixed and allows an element<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1452" href="#">7</a> of the Hatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1453" href="#">8</a> in its initial processes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It admits the Asana, it admits the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1454" href="#">9</a> Pranayam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It is true it reduces each to one of its kind, but the method of conquest is physical and therefore not Rajayogic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It may be said that the stillness of the body is essential to concentration or to samadhi; but this is a convention of the Hathayoga.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Rajayogin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1455" href="#">10</a> concedes no such importance to the body; he knows by experience that concentration can be secured in any easy and unconstrained posture which allows one to forget the body; it is often as much helped by rhythmic motion as by stillness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Samadhi, when it comes, itself secures stillness of the body.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The pure Rajayogin dispenses </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 508</p>
<p class="PE"> therefore with the physical practice of Asana.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2083"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The real reason why Patanjali laid so much stress<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1456" href="#">11</a> on Asana was that he thought Pranayam essential to samadhi and Asana essential to Pranayam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It is difficult, though not impossible, to do the practice of Pranayam according to Patanjali’s system without perfect bodily stillness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It can be done and has been done even while walking about, but this is not so easy or usual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Now Pranayam in its proper sense, the mastery of the vital force in oneself and Nature, is essential to every Rajayogin, but it can be brought about by much simpler methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The only physical process<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1457" href="#">12</a> that the Rajayogin finds helpful enough to be worth doing, is <i>nadishuddhi</i> 
[<span class="unicod_norm">नाडीशुद्धि</span>] or purification<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1458" href="#">13</a> of the nerve system by regular breathing and this can be done while lying, sitting, reading, writing, walking<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1459" href="#">14</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This process has great virtues.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>It has a wonderfully<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1460" href="#">15</a> calming effect on the whole mind and body, drives out every lurking disease in the system, awakens the yogic force accumulated in former lives and, even where no such latent force exists, removes the physical obstacles to the wakening<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1461" href="#">16</a> of the Kundalini shakti.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2084"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But even this process is not essential.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The Rajayogin knows that by tranquillising the mind he can tranquillise the body, by mastering the mind he can master both the body and the prana.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This is the great secret of the Rajayoga that mind is the master of the body, creates it and conditions it, body is not the master, creator or lawgiver of the mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It may be said that the body at least affects the mind, but this is the other discovery of the Rajayogin that the body need not in the least affect the mind <i>unless by our consent we allow it to do so</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The kumbhak or natural cessation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1462" href="#">17</a> of the breathing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1463" href="#">18</a> is essential to the deeper kinds of Samadhi, not to all; but even so he finds that by the cessation of the lawless restlessness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1464" href="#">19</a> of the mind, which we mistakenly call thought, we can easily, naturally and spontaneously bring about the cessation of the breathing, a calm, effortless and perfect kumbhak.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>He therefore dispenses with physical processes, easy or laborious, and goes straight to the root of the problem, the mind.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2085"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Rajayoga 
is of three kinds, sachesta, salpachesta and nischesta, with effort, with little effort, and 
without effort<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1465" href="#">20</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 509</p>
<p class="PE"> Patanjali’s, the only systematised 
kind, though<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1466" href="#">21</a> each is quite methodical, is sachesta, involving great strain and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1467" href="#">22</a> effort throughout.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We may best compare the systems by taking each of Patanjali’s steps separately and seeing how the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1468" href="#">23</a> three kinds of Rajayogins<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1469" href="#">24</a> will deal with them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In the present article we shall deal with Patanjali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The first step is the preparation of the moral nature, the discipline<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1470" href="#">25</a> of the heart, its perfection in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1471" href="#">26</a> the four great qualities of love, purity, courage and calm, without which siddhi in the Rajayoga is impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Patanjali prescribes the practice of the five yamas or regulating moral exercises, truth, justice and honesty, harmlessness, chastity and refusal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1472" href="#">27</a> of ownership, and the five niyamas or regulating moral habits, cleanliness and purity, contentment, austerity, meditation on Scripture<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1473" href="#">28</a>, worship and devotion to God.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>In order to establish these habits and exercises and remove the impurities of the heart it is evident that Patanjali intends us to use the method of abhyasa or constant practice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Anyone<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1474" href="#">29</a> who has made the attempt will realise how difficult it is to compass all these qualities and how long and tedious a discipline is required to establish them even imperfectly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Patanjali seeks to purify and quiet the life while the mind and heart<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1475" href="#">30</a> are yet impure and restless, a system possible only to hermits in an asrama.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>For this reason the Rajayoga has fled from the homes of men<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1476" href="#">31</a> and taken refuge in the forest and the cavern<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1477" href="#">32</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2086"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Afterwards Patanjali recommends the quieting of the body and the mastering<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1478" href="#">33</a> of the Prana by Asana and Pranayam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The reason of this is clear enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The Pranayam of the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1479" href="#">34</a> Hathayoga does not lead to purity, but to force and intensity; every quality that it finds potent in the system it raises to tenfold activity and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Unless therefore the life and character be previously made<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1480" href="#">35</a> quiet and pure, Pranayam done in one’s own strength may do immense moral<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1481" href="#">36</a>, physical and mental<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1482" href="#">37</a> mischief.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Allowing for the overcoming<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1483" href="#">38</a> of his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1484" href="#">39</a> initial difficulty and for the admission of Hatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1485" href="#">40</a> into Rajayoga, it must be admitted that Patanjali’s system is admirably logical and reasonable in its arrangement.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2087"><!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Next comes the mastery<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1486" href="#">41</a> of the mind, that restless, self-willed and shifting force which is so difficult<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1487" href="#">42</a> to control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Again, as in </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 510</p>
<p class="PE"> his previous steps, Patanjali relies wholly on abhyasa or practice<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1488" href="#">43</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>He arranges concentration in four stages of development, Pratyahara or the drawing inward of the senses from their objects; Dharana, or the success in this process resulting in the fixing of the mind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1489" href="#">44</a> for a moment on a single thought, feeling or object, — such as a single part of the body, the tip of the nose or the centre of the brows for 
preference<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1490" href="#">45</a>; Dhyana or the continuation of this state for a fixed period; Samadhi or the entire withdrawing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1491" href="#">46</a> into oneself for an indefinite time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The preliminary process<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1492" href="#">47</a> once successful, the rest follows with comparative ease, but the preliminary process is itself so<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1493" href="#">48</a> enormously difficult that one would<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1494" href="#">49</a> be amazed at Patanjali’s putting it first, if one did not perceive that he is relying on the rigorous and thorough mastery of each step before the next is attempted; he trusts to the Hathayogic kumbhak to bring about Pratyahara with comparative ease.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>Even as it is, most Yogins prefer to take the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1495" href="#">50</a> Dharana or concentration on a single object first<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1496" href="#">51</a>, trusting to the practice of Dharana to bring about Pratyahara by a natural process.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>This is undoubtedly the more easy and straightforward process, though Patanjali’s is the more logical and scientific, and, if mastered, may lead to greater results.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2088"><!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Concentration once attained, we proceed to what Patanjali evidently considers the essence of Yoga, the coercion of all vrittis or functionings of the mental and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1497" href="#">52</a> moral qualities so as to arrive at <i>sanyama</i> or turning of<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1498" href="#">53</a> the whole passionless intelligent Will in the spirit on whatsoever the Yogin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1499" href="#">54</a> wishes to possess, from the realisation of God to the enjoyment of mundane objects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>But how is this silencing of the vrittis to be effected? for the yamas and niyamas only establish certain good habits of life, they do not thoroughly purify mind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1500" href="#">55</a> and heart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>We have to do it by a process of removal by replacement, always depending on abhyasa, replacing bad vrittis by good, the many good by the few better, the few better by the one<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1501" href="#">56</a> best, until we arrive at absolute sanyama.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>This can be done, not easily but without<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1502" href="#">57</a> insuperable difficulty if the power of concentration<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1503" href="#">58</a> is thoroughly attained<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1504" href="#">59</a> by Patanjali’s method.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2092"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The greatness of the French Revolution lies not in what it effected, but in what it thought and was.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Its action was chiefly destructive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It prepared many things, it founded nothing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Even the constructive activity of Napoleon only built a halfway house in which the ideas of 1789 might rest until the world was fit to understand them better and really fulfil them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The ideas themselves were not new; they existed in Christianity and before Christianity they existed in Buddhism; but in 1789 they came out for the first time from the Church and the Book and sought to remodel government and society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It was an unsuccessful attempt, but even the failure changed the face of Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>And this effect was chiefly due to the force, the enthusiasm, the sincerity with which the idea was seized upon and the thoroughness with which it was sought to be applied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The cause of the failure was the defect of knowledge, the excess of imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The basal ideas, the types, the things to be established were known; but there had been no experience of the ideas in practice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>European society, till then, had been permeated, not with liberty, but with bondage and repression; not with equality, but with inequality and injustice; not<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1507" href="#">1</a> with brotherhood, but with selfish force and violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The world was not ready, nor is it even now ready for the fullness of the practice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is the goal of humanity, and we are yet far off from the goal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But the time has come for an approximation being attempted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>And the first necessity is the discipline of brotherhood, the organisation of brotherhood, — for without the spirit and habit of fraternity neither liberty nor equality can be maintained for more than a short season.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The French were ignorant of this practical principle; they made liberty the basis, brotherhood the superstructure, founding the triangle upon its apex.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>For owing to the dominance of Greece and Rome in their imagination they were saturated with the idea of liberty and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 513</p>
<p class="PE"> only formally admitted the Christian and Asiatic principle of brotherhood.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>They built according to their knowledge, but the triangle has to be reversed before it can stand permanently.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>She called the Yatudhani in her to her aid and summoned up the Rakshasi.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The Yatudhani is the delight of destruction, the fury of slaughter, Rudra in the Universal Being, Rudra, the bhuta<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1508" href="#">2</a>, the criminal, the lord of the animal in man, the lord of the demoniac, Pashupati, Pramathanatha.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The Rakshasi is the unbridled, licentious self-assertion of the ego which insists on the gratification of all its instincts good and bad and furiously shatters all opposition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It was the Yatudhani and the Rakshasi who sent their hoarse cry over France, adding to the luminous mantra, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, the stern and terrible addition “or Death.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Death to the Asura, death to all who oppose God’s evolution, that was the meaning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>With these two terrible Shaktis Kali did Her work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>She veiled Her divine knowledge with the darkness of wrath and passion, She drank blood as wine, naked of tradition and convention She danced over all Europe and the whole continent was filled with the warcry and the carnage and rang<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1509" href="#">3</a> with the hunkara and the attahasyam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It was only when She found that She was trampling on Mahadeva, God expressed in the principle of Nationalism, that She remembered Herself, flung aside Napoleon, the mighty Rakshasa, and settled down quietly to her work of perfecting nationality as the outer shell within which brotherhood may be securely and largely organised.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Aristocratic tribune of the people, unprincipled champion of principles, lordly democrat, — a man in whom reflection was turbulent, prudence itself bold, unflinching and reckless, the man was the meeting-place of two ages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>He had the passions of the past, not its courtly restraint; the turbulence, genius, impetuosity of the future, not its steadying attachment to ideas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>There is an honour of the aristocrat which has its root in manners and respects the sanctity of its own traditions; that is the honour of the Conservative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>There is an honour of the democrat which has its root in ideas and respects the sanctity of its own principles; that is the honour of the Liberal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Mirabeau had neither.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>He was the pure egoist, the eternal Rakshasa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Not for the sake of justice and liberty did he love justice and liberty but for the sake of Mirabeau.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Had his career been fortunate, the forms of the old regime wide enough to satisfy his ambitions and passions, the upheaval of 1789 might have found him on the other side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>But because the heart and senses of Mirabeau were unsatisfied, the French Revolution triumphed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>So it is that God prepares the man and the moment, using good and evil with a divine impartiality for His mighty ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Without the man the moment is a lost opportunity; without the moment the man is a force inoperative.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>It would be difficult to lay down the precise services which made the existence of Danton necessary for the success of the Revolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>There are certain things he did, and no man else could have done, which compelled destiny; there are certain things he said which made France mad with resolution and courage.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The power from which they sprang, expressed itself rarely in deeds and only at supreme moments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>The energy of Danton lay dormant, indolent, scattering itself in stupendous oratory, satisfied with feelings and phrases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>But each time it stirred, it convulsed events and sent a shock of primal elemental force rushing through the consciousness of the French nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>While he lived, moved, spoke, felt, acted, the energy he did not himself use, communicated itself to the millions; the thoughts he did not utter, seized on minds which took them for their own; the actions he might have done better himself, were done worse by others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Danton was contented.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Magnificent and ostentatious, he was singularly void of personal ambition.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2252">You, my alter ego, my second existence, now sitting comfortably at home and, doubtless, reading the romantic fictions of the <i>Empire</i> by the light of heavily-priced kerosine; I, who roam uncomfortably in foreign climes, sighing for the joys of the Press Act and the house-search; these faces, white and unfamiliar, that surround me; these miles of soulless brick and faultless macadam, the fitting body for a point-device and dapper civilisation which has lost sight of grandeur, beauty and nobility in life, — are we, I wonder, flitting visions of a nightmare that passes or real men and women made in God’s image?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Was life always so trivial, always so vulgar, always so loveless, pale and awkward as the Europeans have made it?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>This well-appointed comfort oppresses me; this perfection of machinery will not allow the soul to remember that it is not itself a machine.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2253"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Is this then the end of the long march of human civilisation, this spiritual suicide, this quiet petrifaction of the soul into matter?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Was the successful business-man that grand culmination of manhood toward which evolution was striving?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>After all, if the scientific view is correct, why not?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>An evolution that started with the protoplasm and flowered in the ourang-outang and the chimpanzee, may well rest satisfied with having created hat, coat and trousers, the British Aristocrat, the American capitalist and the Parisian Apache.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>For these, I believe, are the chief triumphs of the European enlightenment to which we bow our heads.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>For these Augustus created Europe, Charlemagne refounded civilisation, Louis XIV regulated society, Napoleon systematised the French Revolution.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2254"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Europe boasts of her science and its marvels.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But an Indian cannot content himself with asking like Voltaire, as the supreme question, “What have you invented?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>His glance is at the soul; it is that into which he is accustomed to inquire<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1535" href="#">1</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>To the braggart intellect of Europe he is bound to reply, “I am not interested in what you know, I am interested in what you are.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>With all your discoveries and inventions, what have you become?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Your enlightenment is great, — but what are these strange creatures that move about in the electric light you have installed and imagine that they are human?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Is it a great gain for the human intellect to have grown more acute and discerning, if the human soul dwindles?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2255"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But Science does not admit the existence of soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The soul, it says, is only an organised republic of animalcules, and it is in the mould of that idea Europe has recast herself; — that is what the European nations are becoming, organised republics of animalcules, — very intelligent, very methodical, very wonderful talking and reasoning animalcules, but still animalcules.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Not what the race set out to be, creatures made in the image of the Almighty, gods that having fallen from heaven remember and strive to recover their heritage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Man in Europe is descending steadily from the human level and approximating to the ant and the hornet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The process is not complete but it is progressing apace, and if nothing stops the debacle, we may hope to see its culmination in this twentieth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>After all our superstitions were better than this enlightenment, our social abuses less murderous to the hopes of the race than this social perfection.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2256"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It is a very pleasant inferno they have created in Europe, a hell not of torments but of pleasures, of lights and carriages, of balls and dances and suppers, of theatres and cafés and music halls, of libraries and clubs and Academies, of National Galleries and Exhibitions, of factories, shops, banks and Stock Exchanges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But it is hell all the same, not the heaven of which the saints and the poets dreamed, the new Jerusalem, the golden city.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>For what we believe, that we become.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The animal lives by a routine arranged for him by Nature; his life is devoted to the satisfaction of his instincts bodily, vital and emotional, and he satisfies himself mechanically by a regular response to the working of those instincts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Nature has regularised everything for him and provided the machinery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Man in Europe arranges his own routine, invents his own machinery, and adds to the needs of which he is a slave, the intellectual.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2258"><!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>System, organisation, machinery have attained their perfection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Bondage has been carried to its highest expression, and from a passion for organising external liberty Europe is slaying her spiritual freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>When the inner freedom is gone, the external liberty will follow it, and a social tyranny more terrible, inquisitorial and relentless than any that caste ever organised in India, will take its place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The process has already begun.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The shell of external liberty remains, the core is already being eaten away.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Because he is still free to gratify his senses and enjoy himself, the European thinks himself free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>He does not know what teeth are gnawing into the heart of his liberty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2259"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Still in his inmost self he has an uneasy consciousness of something terribly, vitally wrong, and therefore he is turning more and more to Socialism among the thinking or cultured, among the unthinking to Anarchism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The Socialist hopes, by accepting, swiftly fulfilling and thoroughly organising the inevitable tyranny of society, at least to recover leisure and create a breathing space in which to realise the dignity, beauty and repose of the god in man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>The Anarchist sees in Government and Society the enemy of the race and gropes for the bomb and the revolver to recover individual liberty and destroy the tyranny of the majority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Both are guilty of the same fallacy, the mechanical fallacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>One hopes to liberate man by perfecting machinery, the other by destroying it.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2264">I am as yet among the unregenerate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Instead of my eccentric notions of life changing under the pressure of victorious European enlightenment, they seem to harden and fix their hold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Here I am in Paris, the centre of civilisation, and I am still the same darkskinned barbarian you knew.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Neither the complexion of my face nor the complexion of my thoughts has improved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I still believe in God and Vedanta, in India and impossibilities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Man is still to my eyes divine and not an animal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>I believe in the soul and am afflicted with the imagination that it has a past and a future, that it neither came ready made into the world out of the mother’s womb nor will disintegrate at the end whether on the pyre or in the coffin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>That our first stage is an embryo and our last worms or ashes, is a creed I hold to be still unproved and unprovable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>I believe that nothing in this world is made, but everything grows; that body cannot create soul and that a mass of cells is not Buddha or Napoleon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>And if you ask for my ground of belief, I shall still refuse to base it on the logical reason, which can only argue and cannot see, and I shall give the answer of the visionary, the victim of hallucinations, that I have seen my soul and talked face to face with my Creator.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2265"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>There are excellent logicians in Paris.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>One of them spoke </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 549</p>
<p class="PE"> the other day of the power of telepathy and, while admitting it to be a fact, argued that to develop the power would be to go back to the savage; it would be a denial of Science and civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The civilised man sees with his eyes, talks with his tongue; to see with the soul, mind to talk with mind is a thing weird and barbarous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>That is what the logical reason is.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It can support the grossest absurdity under the sun and yet satisfy its user.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The savage had the power, the civilised man has renounced it as an encumbrance or a superstition; to develop the power is to go back from civilisation to the savage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The argument is undeniable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Whether it is not worth while, in this respect, to go back to the savage, is a question my logical friend refuses to discuss.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>To entertain it would be an insult to civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Another gentleman of equal clarity poohpoohed the idea of considering the existence of God and immortality on the ground that the very motion would be retrograde.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>“It would be going back,” he cried, “it would be going back.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>We have got rid of God; we have finished with the superstition of immortality.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Nature replaces God, Progress dethrones Immortality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Yet, in fact, these are merely different names for one thing in its varying aspects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Nature is God manifest in Matter; Progress is possible because the soul of man is immortal.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>The body is bound to its surroundings, but the heart exceeds them, and I carry the love of India with me even to the coldest climes.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>It will be well when every Indian, instead of taking a waxlike stamp from his foreign surroundings, is able to carry India with him wherever he goes.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2271">Your list of questions is rather a long one.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>I will answer you in the mass rather than in detail; and chiefly I will attack two fallacies with which your letter teems, if I may use such an </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 551</p>
<p class="PE"> expression, and which lie at the root of your very disfavourable attitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>There are two Hinduisms; one which takes its stand on the kitchen and seeks its Paradise by cleaning the body; another which seeks God, not through the cooking pot and the social convention, but in the soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The latter is also Hinduism and it is a good deal older and more enduring than the other; it is the Hinduism of Bhishma and Srikrishna, of Shankara and Chaitanya, the Hinduism which exceeds Hindusthan, was from of old and will be for ever, because it grows eternally through the aeons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Its watchword is not <i>kriya</i>, but <i>karma</i>; not <i>shastra</i>, but <i>jnanam</i>; not <i>achar</i>, but <i>bhakti</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Yet it accepts <i>kriya</i>, <i>shastra</i> and <i>achar</i>, not as ends to be followed for their own sake, but as means to perfect <i>karma</i>, <i>jnanam</i> and <i>bhakti</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a><i>Kriya</i> in the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1536" href="#">1</a> dictionary means every practice which helps the gaining of higher knowledge such as the mastering of the breath, the repetition of the mantra, the habitual use of the Name, the daily meditation on the idea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>By <i>shastra</i> it means the knowledge which regulates <i>karma</i>, which fixes the <i>kartavyam</i> and the <i>akartavyam</i>, that which should be done and that which should not, and it recognises<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1537" href="#">2</a> two sources of that knowledge, — the eternal wisdom, as distinct from the temporary injunctions, in our ancient books and the book that is written by God in the human heart, the eternal and <i>apaurusheya</i> Veda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>By <i>achar</i> it understands all moral discipline by which the heart is purified and made a fit vessel for divine love.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>There are certain <i>kriyas</i>, certain rules of <i>shastra</i>, certain details of <i>achar</i>, which are for all time and of perpetual application; there are others which are temporary, changing with the variation of <i>desh</i>, <i>kal</i> and <i>patra</i>, time, place and the needs<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1538" href="#">3</a> of humanity.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It was in a time of calamity, of contraction under external pressure that Hinduism fled from the inner temple and hid itself in the kitchen.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2272"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The higher and truer Hinduism is also of two kinds, sectarian and unsectarian, disruptive and synthetic, that which binds itself up in the aspect and that which seeks the All.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The first is born of <i>rajasic</i> or <i>tamasic</i> attachment to an idea, an experience, an opinion or set of opinions, a temperament, an attitude, a </p>

<p class="PE"> particular guru, a chosen Avatar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This attachment is intolerant, arrogant, proud of a little knowledge, scornful of knowledge that is not its own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is always talking of the <i>kusanskars</i>, superstitions, of others and is blind to its own; or it says, “My guru is the only guru and all others are either charlatans or inferior,” or, “My temperament is the right temperament and those who do not follow my path are fools or pedants or insincere”; or “My Avatar is the real God Himself and all the others are only lesser revelations”; or “My ishta devata is God, the others are only His partial manifestations.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>When the soul rises higher, it follows by preference its own ideas, experiences, opinions, temperament, guru, ishta, but it does not turn an ignorant and exclusive eye upon others.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>But when the full knowledge dawns, I embrace all experiences in myself, I know all ideas to be true, all opinions useful, all experiences and attitudes means and stages in the acquisition of universal experience and completeness, all gurus imperfect channels or incarnations of the one and only Teacher, all ishtas and Avatars to be God Himself.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2273"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>That is what Ramakrishna taught by His life and sadhana and therefore is He the Avatar of the age, the One who prepares the future of humanity.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">“Suprabhat”</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2307"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The paper <i>Suprabhat</i>, a Bengali monthly edited by Kumari Kumudini Mitra, daughter of Sj. Krishna Kumar Mitra, enters this month on its third year.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The first issue of the new year is before us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We notice a great advance in the interest and variety of the articles, the calibre of the writers and the quality of the writing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>From the literary point of view the chief ornament of the number is the brief poem <i>Duhkhabhisar</i>, by Sj. Rabindranath Tagore.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is one of those poems in which the peculiar inimitable quality of our greatest lyric poet comes out with supreme force, beauty and sweetness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Rabindra Babu has a legion of imitators and many have been very successful in catching up his less valuable mannerisms of style and verse, as is the manner of imitators all the world over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But the poignant sweetness, passion and spiritual depth and mystery of a poem like this, the haunting cadences subtle with a subtlety which is not of technique but of the soul, and the honeyladen felicity of the expression, these are the essential Rabindranath and cannot be imitated, because they are things of the spirit and one must have the same sweetness and depth of soul before one can hope to catch any of these desirable qualities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We emphasise this inimitableness because the legion of imitators we mention are doing harm to the progress of our poetry as well as to the reputation of their model and we would suggest to them to study this poem and realise the folly of their persistent attempt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>One of the most remarkable peculiarities of Rabindra Babu’s genius is the happiness and originality with which he has absorbed the whole spirit of Vaishnav poetry and turned it into something essentially the same and yet new and modern.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>He has given the old sweet spirit of emotional and passionate religion an expression of more delicate and complex richness voiceful of subtler and more penetratingly spiritual shades of feeling than </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 566</p>
<p class="PE"> the deep-hearted but simple early age of Bengal could know.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The old Vaishnav <span class="devan">bhāva</span> — there is no English word for it, — was easily seizable, broad and strong.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The <span class="devan">bhāva</span> of these poems is not translatable in any other language than that the poet has used, — a striking proof is the unsatisfactory attempt of the poet himself, recorded in another article in this issue, to explain in prose his own poem, <i>Sonar Tari</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But while the intellect tries in vain to find other intellectual symbols for the poet’s meaning, the poetry seizes on the heart and convinces the imagination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>These poems are of the essence of poetry and refuse to be rendered in any prose equivalent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Poetry is created not from the intellect or the outer imagination but comes from a deeper source within to which men have no means of access except when the divine part within seizes on the brain and makes it a passive instrument for utterance the full meaning of which the brain is unable at the moment to grasp.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This is the divine mania and enthusiasm which the subtle spiritual discernment of Plato discovered to be the real meaning of what we call inspiration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And of this unattainable force the best lyrics of Rabindranath are full to overflowing.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2308"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The article <i>Shantiniketane Rabindranath</i> by Sj. Jitendranath Banerji is another feature of great interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The writer has a good descriptive gift and the passages which describe the Shantiniketan are admirable; but the chief interest naturally centres in the conversation with the poet which is recorded with great fullness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The private talk of a rich and gifted nature with a power of conversational expression is always suggestive and we await with interest the future issue of this article.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We hope Jitendra Babu will give us a fuller view of the remarkable educational experiment which this original mind is developing in the quiet shades of Bolpur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The brief hints given of the moral training and the method of education followed point to a system far in advance of the National Council of Education which is still tyrannised over by a tradition and method not only European but unprogressively European.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>A brief instalment of Sj. Aurobindo Ghose’s <i>Karakahini</i> is also given which describes the identification parades of the Bomb Case, gives some glimpses </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 567</p>
<p class="PE"> of the approver Noren Gossain and deals with the personal character of some of the jail officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a><i>Nanak Charit</i> by Sj. Krishna<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1563" href="#">1</a> Kumar Mitra, the first instalment of which is given in this issue, commands interest both by its subject and the name of its writer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The two chapters given are full of interesting details of Nanak’s birth and childhood and promise an attractive biography of one of the greatest names in religious history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>An article of minor importance is the continuation of Sj. Jadunath Chakrabarti’s <i>Ekannabarti Paribar o Strishiksha</i>, which is of considerable merit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The author has seized on two of the great advantages of the joint family system, its ideal of a wider brotherhood and unity and its ample training in morale and capacity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a><i>Dainik Bal</i> and the poem <i>Bodhan</i> seem to us to be failures, but there is no other feature of this number which is without merit or interest.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2309"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We have left to the last Dr. P. C. Ray’s long article on “The Bengali Brain and its Misuse”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It is a long indictment of past and present Bengal, covering sixteen pages of the magazine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Dr. P. C. Ray is a name which is already a pride to the nation to which he belongs and his deep scientific knowledge, original research and creativeness are one of the most conspicuous instances of that strong, acute and capable Bengali intellect which he admits to be inferior to none.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Any article from his pen must be of great interest and cannot be without value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But it is one of the unfortunate results of the denationalising influence of our past education that a mind like Dr. Ray’s should be without intellectual sympathy for the old national culture<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1564" href="#">2</a> whose inherited tendencies his own character, life and achievements illustrate in so distinguished a manner.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>If it had not been for the past which Dr. P. C. Ray condemns, such noble types as the last fifty years of Bengal teems with, would not have been possible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>As to the necessity of far-reaching changes in the future we do not greatly differ with the writer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The immediate past has been a period of contraction and the reservation of strength, the future will be a period of expansion and the liberation and expenditure of strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The structure of the new age must necessarily differ from that of the old.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>But the spirit of the article is narrow and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 568</p>
<p class="PE"> intolerant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It is couched in that general spirit of self-depreciation and indiscriminate fault-finding which was a characteristic of our people when national hope and energy were at their nadir.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>There are all the stock denunciations with which we were familiar before the recent resurgence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Such writings void of the note of hope, encouragement and energy, will not help a nation to rise but rather depress it and push it back into the past.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Moreover, Dr. Ray makes the same mistake which European writers made when they condemned the Middle Ages wholesale because they were a period of contraction and not of expansion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>That mistake has now been recognised in Europe and justice has been done to that which was praiseworthy as well as to that which was bad in the “Dark Ages”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We in India are recovering from a similar error and if there are those who go to the opposite extreme and see nothing good outside the mediaeval Hindu culture and forms, the same thing happened in Europe and for the same reason, as a reaction from that very intolerance and sweeping denunciation which are the spirit of Dr. Ray’s article.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It cannot last any more than it lasted in Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Some of the strictures we hold to be too much at secondhand; especially in his criticisms of religion the writer seems to us to be wandering outside the province in which he can speak with authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>After all one must enter into the spirit of an age and civilisation before one can profitably criticise it, otherwise we miss the meaning of history and falsify its values.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless the article is ably written and should be studied as a complete expression of the Europeanised standpoint in looking at Indian problems.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>As to the present, Dr. Ray lays too much stress on the survivals of the end of the nineteenth century when the national consciousness touched bottom and ignores the youthful strength and energy which is preparing the twentieth.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2312"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>This is one of a series of publications by Mr. Arthur Avalon consisting of texts and translations of the Tantras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The hymns collected and translated in this volume are, however, taken from other sources besides the Tantras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Many of them are from the considerable body of devotional hymns attributed by tradition to the philosopher Shankaracharya, a few from the Mahabharata and the Puranas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Most are well-known <span class="devan">stotras</span> addressed to the various forms and names of the female Energy, Mother of the worlds, whose worship is an important part of that many-sided and synthetic whole which we call Hinduism.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2313"><!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The work of translation has been admirably done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The one slight defect is the preservation untranslated of Sanskrit words other than names which might well have been rendered into English.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The translation is at once faithful, simple and graceful in style and rhythm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>No English version can reproduce the majesty of the Sanskrit rhythms and the colour and power of the original, but within the limits of the possible the work could hardly have been better executed.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2314"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The translation is accompanied by brief but numerous notes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Avalon has made a principle of submission to the authority of the Hindu<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1565" href="#">2</a> commentators and learned men whom he has consulted or taken as his guides in the study of the Tantra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>He writes, “It is necessary to study the Hindu commentators and to seek the oral aid of those who possess the traditional interpretation of the Shastra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Without this and an understanding of what Hindu worship is and means, absurd mistakes are likely to be made.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>I have thus, in addition to such oral aid, availed myself of the Commentaries of Nilakantha on the Mahabharata, of Gopala </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 570</p>
<p class="PE"> Chakravarti and Nagoji Bhatta on Chandi, and of Nilakantha on the Devibhagavata.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>As regards the Tantra, the great Sadhana Shastra, nothing which is both of an understanding and accurate character can be achieved without a study of the original texts undertaken with the assistance of the Tantric gurus and pundits who are the authorised custodians of its traditions.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This careful scrupulousness is undoubtedly the right attitude for the work which Mr. Avalon has set himself, — to present to the English-reading public the philosophy and worship of the Tantra and the way of the Shaktas as they have been traditionally practised and understood in mediaeval and modern India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The method followed assures a sound basis free from the vagaries of learned ignorance and unfettered ingenuity which render so much of the work of European scholarship on Indian subjects fantastic, unsound and ephemeral.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It cannot, we think, be the final attitude; an independent scrutiny of the ancient scriptures and forms of philosophy and religion is needed through the whole range of Indian thought and devotion both to recover their more ancient and original forms and principles often concealed by later accretions and crystallisings and to separate from them whatever is of imperishable worth and utility for the spiritual future of mankind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But meanwhile, and especially when a great and difficult subject is being for the first time brought forward in an adequate manner to general notice, the conservative method is undoubtedly the most desirable.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2315"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Commentators, however, even the most learned, are subject to error, as Mr. Avalon has had to recognise in his translation of the verse which declares that all women without exception are forms of the Great Mother.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The commentator would have us believe that the phrase <span class="devan">striyaḥ samastāḥ sakalā jagatsu</span> means all women who possess the sixty-four arts and are devoted to their husbands, are modest, etc.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The translator rightly rejects this conventional distortion of a great and profound philosophical truth; he translates “all women without exception throughout the world”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>We wonder whether the phrase does not admit of a different shade cutting deeper into the heart of things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The lines are,</p>

<p class="PE"> <span class="devan">Vidyāḥ samastās tava devi bhedāḥ</span></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2316"><span class="devan">Striyaḥ samastāḥ sakalā jagatsu</span>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2317"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Is there not a hint of a distinction between the simple <span class="devan">bhedāḥ</span> and <span class="devan">sakalāḥ</span>?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>“All sciences, O Goddess, are different parts of thee, all women entirely in the worlds.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The sense would then be that wherever the feminine principle is found in the living personality, we have the entire presence of the world-supporting maternal soul of the Divinity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Devi with all her aspects, <span class="devan">kalās</span>, is there in the Woman; in the Woman we have to see Durga, Annapurna, Tara, the Mahavidyas, and therefore it is said in the Tantra, in the line quoted by Mr. Avalon in his preface, “Wherever one sees the feet of Woman, one should give worship in one’s soul even as to one’s guru.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Thus this thought of the Shakta side of Hinduism becomes an uncompromising declaration of the divinity of woman completing the Vedantic declaration of the concealed divinity in man which we are too apt to treat in practice as if it applied only in the masculine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We put away in silence, even when we do not actually deny it, the perfect equality in difference of the double manifestation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2318"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>There are other instances in which the translators seem to us not to have escaped the misleading wiles of the commentator.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We may instance the passage in the Hymn to Mahadevi in which the Goddess is described as being “both black and grey”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>“Smoke-coloured” would be a closer rendering of the epithet <span class="devan">dhūmra</span>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We are told in the note that it means “that which is with smoke, the sacrificial rite, here the knowledge of the rites”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>This is a scholastic interpretation which we cannot accept.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The different hues of the Goddess are always psychologically symbolic and Mr. Avalon has himself an excellent passage to that effect in his Introduction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>But, although occasionally provoking dissent, the notes are throughout interesting and instructive and often throw a new light on the implications of the text.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2319"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Mr. Avalon in his publications insists upon the greatness of the Tantra and seeks to clear away by a dispassionate statement of the real facts the cloud of misconceptions which have obscured our view of this profound and powerful system.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We shall </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 572</p>
<p class="PE"> have occasion to deal with this aspect of his work when we come to speak of the Mahanirvana Tantra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>In this volume he justifies against European prejudice the attribution of the feminine form and quality to God and against modern ignorance generally the image-worship which the Tantra in common with other Hindu systems makes part of the first stage in religious progress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>On both points we are in general agreement with his standpoint, though we do not hold that religious evolution must necessarily follow the line laid down by the Tantra.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2320"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Human conceptions of the Divine divide themselves first into the worship of the formed and the aspiration towards the formless, secondly, into the adoration of the Qualified and the urge of the rarest spirits towards the Unqualified, the Absolute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>For all these stages the Tantric worship and discipline provides.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>How can the Formless invest Himself with form, asks the religious rationalist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The universe is there to reply.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>These are the mental images in which we worship God.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The Hindu believes that to whatever form he brings his devotion, the love of God is bound to assume and vivify it, and we cannot say that the belief is irrational.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>For if there is a Consciousness in the universe and transcending it which answers to the yearning of all these creatures and perhaps Itself yearns towards them with the love of the Father, the Mother, the Friend, the Lover, and a love surpassing all these, then it is idle to suppose that It would assume or create for its own pleasure and glory the forms of the universe, but would disdain as an offence to Its dignity or purity those which the love of the worshipper offers to It and which after all Itself has formed in his heart or his imagination.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2358"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The discovery of Oriental Art by the aesthetic mind of Europe is one of the most significant intellectual phenomena of the times.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is one element of a general change which has been coming more and more rapidly over the mentality of the human race and promises to culminate in the century to which we belong.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>This change began with the discovery of Eastern thought and the revolt of Europe against the limitations of the Graeco-Roman and the Christian ideals which had for some centuries united in an uneasy combination to give a new form to her mentality and type of life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The change, whose real nature could not be distinguished so long as the field was occupied by the battle between Science and Religion, now more and more reveals itself as an attempt of humanity to recover its lost soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Long overlaid by the life of the intellect and the vital desires, distorted and blinded by a devout religious obscurantism the soul in humanity seems at last to be resurgent and insurgent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1569" href="#">2</a> desire to live, think, act, create from a greater depth in oneself, to know the Unknown, to express with sincerity all that is expressible of the Infinite, this is the trend of humanity’s future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>A philosophy, a literature, an Art, a society which shall correspond to that which is deepest and highest in man and realise something more than the satisfaction of the senses, the desire of the vital parts and the expediencies and efficiencies recognised by the intellect without excluding these necessary elements, these are the things humanity is turning to seek, though in the midst of a chaotic groping, uncertainty and confusion.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2359"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>At such a juncture the value of Eastern Thought and Eastern Art to the world is altogether incalculable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>For their greatness </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 577</p>
<p class="PE"> is that they have never yet fallen away from the ancient truth, the truth of the Soul; they have not gone out of the Father’s house to live on the husks of the sense and the life and the body; they have always seen in the mind and body only instruments for the expression of that which is deeper and greater than its instruments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Even intellect and emotion had for them only a secondary value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Not to imitate Nature but to reveal that which she has hidden, to find significative forms which shall embody for us what her too obvious and familiar symbols conceal, has been the aim of the greatest Art, the Art of prehistoric antiquity and of those countries and ages whose culture has been faithful to the original truth of the Spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Greek culture, on the other hand, deviated on a path which led away from this truth to the obvious and external reality of the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The Greeks sought to use the forms of Nature as they saw and observed them, slightly idealised, a little uplifted, with a reproduction of her best achievement and not, like modern realism, of her deformities and failures; and though they at first used this form to express an ideal, it was bound in the end to turn to the simple service of the intellect and the senses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Mediaeval Art attempted to return to a deeper motive; but great as were its achievements, they dwelt in a certain dim obscurity, an unillumined mystery which contrasts strongly with the light of deeper knowledge that informs the artistic work of the East.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We have now throughout the world a search, an attempt on various lines to discover some principle of significant form in Art which shall escape from the obvious and external and combine delight with profundity, the power of a more searching knowledge with the depth of suggestion, emotion and ecstasy which are the very breath of aesthetic creation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The search has led to many extravagances and cannot be said to have been as yet successful, but it may be regarded as a sure sign and precursor of a new and greater age of human achievement.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2360"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The Oriental Art recognised in Europe has been principally that of China and Japan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It is only recently that the aesthetic mind of the West has begun to open to the greatness of Indian creation in this field or at least to those elements of it which are most characteristic and bear the stamp of the ancient spiritual </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 578</p>
<p class="PE"> greatness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Indian Architecture has indeed been always admired, but chiefly in the productions of the Indo-Saracenic school which in spite of their extraordinary delicacy and beauty have not the old-world greatness and power of the best Hindu, Jain and Buddhistic work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>But Indian sculpture and painting have till recently been scouted as barbarous and inartistic, and for this reason, that they have, more than any other Oriental work, deliberately remained in the extreme of the ancient symbolic conception of the plastic Arts and therefore most entirely offended the rational and imitative eye which is Europe’s inheritance from the Hellene.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is a curious sign of the gulf between the two conceptions that an<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1570" href="#">3</a> European writer will almost always fix for praise precisely on those Indian sculptures which are farthest away from the Indian tradition, — as for instance the somewhat vulgar productions of the Gandhara or bastard Graeco-Indian school or certain statues which come nearest to a faithful imitation of natural forms but are void of inspiration and profound suggestion.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2361"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Recently, however, the efforts of Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Havell and the work of the new school of Indian artists have brought about or at least commenced something like a revolution in the aesthetic standpoint of Western critics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Competent minds have turned their attention to Indian work and assigned it a high place in the artistic creation of the East and even the average European writer has been partly compelled to understand that Indian statuary and Indian painting have canons of their own and cannot be judged either by a Hellenistic or a realistic standard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>More salutary still, the mind of the educated Indian has received a useful shock and may perhaps now be lifted out of the hideous banality of unaesthetic taste into which it had fallen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Whatever benefits the laudable and well-meaning efforts of English educationists may have bestowed on this country, it is certain that, aided by the inrush of the vulgar, the mechanical and the commonplace from the commercial West, they had<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1571" href="#">4</a> succeeded in entirely vulgarising the aesthetic mind and soul of the Indian people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Its innate and instinctive artistic taste has disappeared; the eye and the aesthetic sense have not been so much corrupted as killed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>What more flagrant sign of this debacle could there be </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 579</p>
<p class="PE"> than the fact that all educated India hailed the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma, an incompetent imitation of the worst European styles, as the glory of a new dawn and that hideous and glaring reproductions of them still adorning<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1572" href="#">5</a> its dwellings?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>A rebirth of Indian taste supporting a new Indian Art which shall inspire itself with the old spirit while seeking for fresh forms is now, however, possible and it is certainly a great desideratum for the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>For nothing can be more helpful towards the discovery of that which we are now vaguely seeking, a new Art which shall no longer labour to imitate Nature but strive rather to find fresh significant forms for the expression of the Self.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2362"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It is necessary to this end that the wealth of their ancient Art should be brought before the eyes of the people, and it is gratifying to find that an increasing amount of pioneer work is being done in this respect, although still all too scanty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The book before us, Mr. O. C. Gangoly’s <i>South Indian Bronzes</i>, must rank as one of the best of them all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Southern India, less ravaged than the North by the invader and the vandal and profiting by the historic displacement of the centre of Indian culture southward, teems with artistic treasures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gangoly’s book gives us, in an opulent collection of nearly a hundred fine plates preceded by five chapters of letterpress, one side of the artistic work of the South, — its bronzes, chiefly representing the gods and devotees of the Shaiva religion, — for the Shaiva religion has been as productive of sublime and suggestive work in the plastic arts as has been the Vaishnava all over India of great, profound and passionate poetry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>This book is a sumptuous production and almost as perfect as any work of the kind can be in the present state of our knowledge.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2363"><!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>There are certain minor defects which we feel bound to point out to the author.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The work abounds with useful quotations from unprinted Sanskrit works on the rules and conventions of the sculptural Art, works attributed to Agastya and others; but their value is somewhat lessened by the chaotic system of transliteration which Mr. Gangoly has adopted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>He is writing for all India and Europe as well; why then adopt the Bengali solecism which neglects the distinction between the <i>b</i> and the <i>v</i> of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 580</p>
<p class="PE"> the Sanskrit alphabet or that still more ugly and irrational freak by which some in Bengal insist on substituting for the aspirate <i>bh</i> the English <i>v</i>?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Even in these errors the writer is not consistent; he represents the Sanskrit <i>v</i> sometimes by <i>b</i> and sometimes by <i>v</i>, and <i>bh</i> indifferently by <i>v</i>, <i>vh</i> or <i>bh</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Such vagaries are disconcerting and offend against the sense of order and accuracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is always difficult to read Sanskrit in the Roman alphabet which is entirely unsuited to that language, but this kind of system or want of system turns the difficulty almost into an impossibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>We hope that in the important works which he promises us on Pallava Sculpture and South Indian Sculptures Mr. Gangoly will remedy this imperfection of detail.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2364"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The first chapter of the letterpress deals with the legendary origins of South Indian art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>It is interesting and valuable, but there are some startlingly confident statements against which our critical sense protests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>For instance, “it is <i>beyond doubt</i> that the two divisions of the country indicated by the Vindhya ranges were occupied by people essentially different in blood and temperament.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Surely the important theories which hold the whole Indian race to be Dravidian in blood or, without assigning either an “Aryan” or “non-Aryan” origin, believe it to be homogeneous — omitting some islander types on the southern coast and the Mongoloid races of the Himalaya, — cannot be so lightly dismissed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The question is full of doubt and obscurity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The one thing that seems fairly established is that there were at least two types of culture in ancient India, the “Aryan” occupying the Punjab and Northern and Central India, Afghanistan and perhaps Persia and distinguished in its cult by the symbols of the Sun, the Fire and the Soma sacrifice, and the un-Aryan occupying the East, South and West, the nature of which it is quite impossible to restore from the scattered hints which are all we possess.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2365"><!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Again we are astonished to observe that Mr. Gangoly seems to accept the traditional attribution of the so-called Agastya Shastras to the Vedic Rishi of that name.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The quotations from these books are in classical Sanskrit of a fairly modern type, certainly later than the pre-Christian era though Mr. Gangoly </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 581</p>
<p class="PE"> on quite insufficient grounds puts them before Buddha.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>It is impossible to believe that they are the work of the Rishi, husband of Lopamudra, who composed the great body of hymns in an archaic tongue that close the first Mandala of the Rig Veda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Nor can we accept the astonishing identification of the Puranic Prajapati, Kashyapa, progenitor of creatures, with the father of the Kanada who founded the Vaisheshika philosophy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>It distresses us to see Indian inquirers with their great opportunities simply following in the path of certain European scholars, accepting and adding to their unstable fantasies, their huge superstructures founded on weak and scattered evidence and their imaginative “history” of our prehistoric ages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>There is better and sounder work to be done and Indians can do it admirably as Mr. Gangoly himself has shown in this book; for the rest of the work, where he has not to indulge in these <i>obiter dicta</i>, is admirable and flawless.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>There is a sobriety and reserve, a solidity of statement and a sort of sparing exhaustiveness which make it quite the best work of the kind we have yet come across.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>The chapters on the Shilpashastra and the review of the distribution of Shaivite and other work in Southern India are extremely interesting and well-written and the last brief chapter of criticism is perfect both in what it says and what it refrains from saying.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2366"><!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gangoly’s collection of plates, 94 in number, illustrates Southern work in bronze in all its range.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>It opens with a fine Kalasamhara and a number of Dancing Shivas, the characteristic image of the Shaivite art, and contains a great variety of figures; there are among them some beautiful images of famous Shaivite bhaktas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>A few examples of Vaishnava art are also given.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>In a collection so ample and so representative it is obvious that there must be a good deal of work which falls considerably below the best, but the general impression is that of a mass of powerful, striking and inspired creations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>And throughout there is that dominant note which distinguishes Indian art from any other whether of the Occident or of the Orient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>All characteristic Oriental art indeed seeks to go beyond the emotions and the senses; a Japanese landscape of snow and hill is as much an image of the soul as a Buddha or a flame-haired spirit of the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 582</p>
<p class="PE"> thunderbolt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Nature will not see herself there as in a mirror, but rather herself transformed into something wonderfully not herself which is yet her own deeper reality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>But still there is a difference, and it seems to lie in this that other Oriental art, even though it goes beyond the external, usually remains in the cosmic, in the limits of Prakriti, but here there is a perpetual reaching beyond into something absolute, infinite, supernatural, the very ecstasy of the Divine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Even in work not of the best finish or most living inspiration there is this touch which gives it a greatness beyond its actual achievement; rarely indeed does the statuary fall into mere technique or descend entirely into the physical and external.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2367"><!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>It is this tendency, as the author well explains, which causes and in a sense justifies the recoil and incomprehension of the average Occidental mind; for it comes to Art with a demand for the satisfaction of the senses, the human emotions, the imagination moving among familiar things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>It does not ask for a god or for a symbol of the beyond, but for a figure admirably done with scrupulous fidelity to Nature and the suggestion of some vision, imagination, feeling or idea well within the normal range of human experience<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1573" href="#">6</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>The Indian artist deliberately ignores all these demands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>His technique is perfect enough; he uses sculptural line with a consummate mastery, often with an incomparable charm, grace and tenderness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>The rhythm and movement of his figures have a life and power and perfection which conveys a deeper reality than the more intellectualised and less purely intuitive symmetries and groupings of the European styles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>But these bodies are not, when we look close at them, bronze representations of human flesh and human life, but forms of divine life, embodiments of the gods.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE">What these artists strive always to express is the soul and those pure and absolute states of the mind and heart in which the soul manifests its essential being void of all that is petty, transient, disturbed and restless.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>In their human figures it is almost always devotion that is manifested; for this in the Shaiva and Vaishnava religions is the pure state of the soul turned towards God.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>Not only the face, the eyes, the pose but the whole body and every curve and every detail aid in the effect and seem to be concentrated into the essence of absolute adoration, submission, ecstasy, love, tenderness which is the Indian idea of <span class="devan">bhakti</span>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_81"><!-- --></a>The form is, as it were, a wave in which the whole ocean of being expresses itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_82"><!-- --></a>The significance varies; sometimes it is unfathomable thought, sometimes the self-restraint of infinite power, sometimes the self-contained oceanic surge of divine life and energy, sometimes the absolute immortal ecstasy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>But always one has to look not at the form, but through and into it to see that which has seized and informed it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_88"><!-- --></a>It is the note of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 584</p>
<p class="PE"> lyrism in the form, the motive of life, grace, rhythm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_89"><!-- --></a>To use the terms of Indian philosophy, most art expresses the play of Prakriti; Buddhistic art in its most characteristic creations expresses the absolute repose of the Purusha; Hindu art tends to combine the Purusha and Prakriti in one image.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_90"><!-- --></a>But in the earlier stone sculptures it is the sublime repose, tranquil power, majestic concentration of the Deity which the whole image principally represents even in poses expressive of violent movement; the movement is self-contained, subordinated to the repose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_91"><!-- --></a>We find the same motive in some of these bronzes, notably in the wonderful majestically self-possessed thought and power of the Kalasamhara image of Shiva (Plate I);<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1574" href="#">7</a> but for the most part it is life and rhythm that predominate in the form even when there is no actual suggestion of movement.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_93"><!-- --></a>But even other figures that stand or sit seem often to represent only pauses of the dance; often the thought and repose are concentrated in the head and face, the body is quick with potential movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_94"><!-- --></a>This art seems to us to reflect in bronze the lyrical outburst of the Shaivite and Vaishnava devotional literature while the older sculpture had the inspiration of the spiritual epos of the Buddha or else reflects in stone the sublimity of the Upanishads.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">“God, the Invisible King”</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2373"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>A remarkable book with this title by the well-known writer and thinker, Mr. H. G. Wells, has recently appeared, of which only a few extracts are before us, but these are sufficient to reveal its character and thought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is on the part of the writer, speaking not for himself personally alone but as scribe to the spirit of his generation, a definite renunciation of the gospel of an all-sufficient rationalism, a discovery of God, a profession of faith in spirituality as the one lever by which mankind can rise out of the darkness and confusion of its present state into a more perfect living.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>He professes his faith in the God within, the invisible King, who is the immortal part of us, in a coming kingdom of God upon earth which shall not only be a spiritual state in the individual, but the open brotherhood of a divine rule among men, and in self-identification with God, service of him, absolute surrender to him as the whole rule of life for the enlightened modern man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>This is, indeed, a remarkable change of spirit and change of mental outlook and, if Mr. Wells’ claim is just that he is writing as a scribe to the spirit of his generation, it means a revolution in Europe far more important than the Russian with all its idealism and its hopes for a new and beneficent change in politics and society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It means the union of Eastern spiritual knowledge and religious faith with Western pragmatic idealism and their fusion into the basis of a new culture and, we will not say a new universal religion, — for religion must vary with the variations of human nature, — but a new practical spirituality in which all mankind can become one.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2374"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>There is much in Mr. Wells’ statement of his new-born belief that is imperfect, limited and a little crude, much that is grasped with an over-hasty zeal, as was inevitable in the first light of an unripe awakening.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Some of the old limitations of the rationalistic Western mind with its too external outlook upon things still cling </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 586</p>
<p class="PE"> about his new spiritual discovery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>He tells us that the kingdom of God on earth is “not a metaphor, not a mere spiritual state, not a dream, not an uncertain project, . . . it is the close and inevitable destiny of mankind.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This classing of the inner spiritual state, the kingdom of God within us, with a metaphor, a dream, an uncertain project reveals the lingering taint of an excessive pragmatism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The spiritual state is the one thing indispensable; until the mass of mankind can awaken into it, the dream of a perfect society, an open brotherhood of God’s rule, must end in failure and disappointment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The kingdom of God within is the sole possible foundation for the kingdom of God without; for it is the spirit by which man lives that conditions the outer forms of his life.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2375"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Misled by this external view of things Mr. Wells, evidently, still believes that a political and social action is sufficient to bring about the millennium.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>He has discovered that this action must be driven by a spiritual motive, pursued in the passion of a true religious fervour, consecrated to the indwelling God, effective only by an absolute self-surrender to the Divine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But he has a limited vision of his God and brings to it all the aggressiveness and something of the fanaticism of all such limited religious conceptions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>“The new conceptions,” he writes, “do not tolerate either kings or aristocracies or democracies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Its implicit command to all its adherents is to make plain the way to the world theocracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Its rule of life is the discovery and service of the will of God which dwells in the hearts of men and the performance of that will” in the life of the believer, the individual, and of the nation of which he is a part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>“I give myself to God not only because I am so and so, but because I am mankind. . . .<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>I become a knight in God’s service. . . .<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>I become a responsible minister of my king.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>I take sides against injustice, disorder, and against all those temporal kings, emperors, princes, landlords and owners who set themselves against God’s rule and worship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Kings, owners and all who claim rule and decision in the world’s affairs, must either show themselves clearly the fellow-servants of the believer or become the object of his steadfast antagonism.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2376"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>All this is very forcibly said, but it shows that the writer </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 587</p>
<p class="PE"> has not grasped the whole spiritual truth; he has not gone deep enough inward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>As once he dreamed of a class of scientific and rational supermen<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1576" href="#">1</a> establishing a perfect social rule upon earth, so now he thinks that by the action of his banded servants of the invisible King declaring political and social war upon godless Czars, Kaisers, rulers and capitalists the same end can be achieved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>With them is God; in them God dwells, in the others, presumably, he does not dwell; those who have surrendered absolutely to him are the citizens of the kingdom and on them shall be peace; those who do not surrender or even fall short in their surrender, are interlopers, against them the sword.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>A very old kind of militant religionism in a very modern form.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It ignores two ancient, two eternal spiritual truths; first, that God dwells in all and, secondly, that only by becoming conscious of the God within from within can humanity be saved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>God dwells in all and not only in the believer who is conscious of him, — dwells disguised and veiled, and it is by helping others to awaken to the veiled Divine within them that we go the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1577" href="#">2</a> straight way to the founding of his kingdom on earth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>True, an outward battle also has to be fought, but against forces, against institutions<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1578" href="#">3</a> which stand in the way of the spreading of the light and the reign of brotherhood, not against men as unbelievers, — in a spirit of understanding, of knowledge, of firm will, but also of charity for ignorance and of love for the misled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>God, says Mr. Wells, is boundless love, but this boundless love, it seems, is not infinite enough to embrace those who do not believe with you; it rejects them with a steadfast antagonism, it banishes them as “interlopers”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>God’s work least of all should be pursued in a spirit of partisan and sectarian antagonism, but rather with a remembrance that the battle is only a way to peace and the peace must come by the inner submission of the opponent through his recognition of the Divine, through his awakening.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>It is not enough that the believer should perform God’s will and fight for the performance of that will “in the acts and order of the state and nation of which he is a part.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The nation also must be brought not only to believe, but to know, to see, to live in God, otherwise the national performance of God’s will, even <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> if momentarily secured, will soon degenerate into a form.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is possible that what the old religions called “the rule of the saints” may be a preliminary step to the establishment of the full kingdom of God, but that rule can only become secure by the light and fire which is in them kindling itself in the hearts of all mankind.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2377"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>These defects of outlook come from a defect in the conception of the Divine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It consists of “complete Agnosticism in the matter of God the Creator and entire faith in the matter of God the Redeemer”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>A distinction is made between the Veiled Being behind the universe and the living reality in our lives; the latter alone is the true God.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>He is a personal and intimate God.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>He is finite.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>He is a spirit, a single spirit and a single person.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>He has begun and will never end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>And yet he is the immortal part and leader of mankind, our friend and brother and light of the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>And from these first principles is drawn a description of God as certain qualities, boundless love, boundless courage, boundless generosity, thought and steadfast will, and as having motives, characteristics, an aim.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>“This is the belief of the modern mind”, read, the modern Western mind, “with regard to God.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2378"><!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>We can see whence the crudities of this belief arise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The Western mind is still burdened with its scientific vision of the universe as a play of brute force, of life as a struggle, the world a material entity, and therefore of the Spirit of the world, if any there be, conceived agnostically or with a sort of materialistic Pantheism as standing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1579" href="#">4</a> for these things only, the Breath of a physical universe, a sort of mechanical, inconscient Soul of things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Out of this pure materiality mind and soul inexplicably evolve.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>God appears only in man and his aspiration, his longings for a higher order of things, for love, universal sympathy, immortality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>This God and the mechanical inconscient Spirit of the world the Western mind finds it difficult — and no wonder — to bring under the same term.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The simple harmonious truth that God is veiled in the material universe which is only the lowest term, the first appearance of the cosmic Reality, that he unveils himself partially and progressively in man and to man, and that man by </p>

<p class="PE"> growth into self-knowledge and God-knowledge can grow into the whole truth of God and existence, which is one truth, — this seems still to be hidden from these wise men of the West.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>His partial unveiling in man seems to them a birth of the once nonexistent Divine, a coming of God into the world, one knows not whence; and because man appears to be finite, God whom they conceive of as the sum of human aspiration to good, truth, beauty, immortality, is also conceived of as finite.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>But how is that which has begun in Time secure against ending in Time? and how can a finite God be infinite love, courage, strength?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Only that which was from ever, can be for ever, and only that which is infinite in being, can be infinite in force and quality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>We have here an echo of the inconsequent Christian paradox of a soul born by the birth of the body, yet immortal to all eternity, combined with the metaphysical dogma of a God existent, not in being, but in becoming.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>There is an element of truth and value in this belief, but it brings disabling limitations into our inner realisation of God and the practice of a divine life to which it gives a foundation.<!--/SENT--></p>

C. Gangoly, the one man most especially fitted by his knowledge and capacity for this work, is of itself a sufficient guarantee of excellence, — is a significant indication of the progress that is being made in the revival of the aesthetic mind of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Assailed and corrupted in a time of cultural decline and arrest of its creative and artistic faculty by an alien aesthesis and ideals antithetic to its own spirit, it is returning to a right view and understanding of its past greatness, and though much way has still to be made before there can be any universal recovery of the artistic eye and taste, the first steps have been taken with some rapidity and firmness and are all in the right direction.
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>This new and fine effort of the Indian Society of Oriental Arts is likely to be of invaluable aid towards this reawakening; its magnificent illustrations are in themselves a revelation of the old beauty and greatness and, admirably selected and supported by illuminating articles, ought to be sufficient to open even the most blinded vision to the meaning and value of our ancient painting and sculpture.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2382"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The subjects of the four articles in this number are all of a considerable interest and touch points or raise and answer questions which have either a central importance or a vital though second-plane prominence in Indian art, and each article is a remarkably just, full, efficient and understanding interpretation of its subject.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The frontispiece is a panel from a Pallava temple at </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 591</p>
<p class="PE"> Mahabalipuram intended to convey at once the essential character and appeal of Indian sculpture by an example which offers no difficulty of understanding or appreciation even to a non-Indian mind or to an uninstructed knowledge, and it is accompanied by a brief but clear and sufficient article.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This example from one of the great styles and periods shows, as is justly said, and shows very perfectly, the Indian principle in the treatment of the human figure, the suppression of small particulars and trivial details in order to secure an extreme simplicity of form and contour, — the best condition for accomplishing the principal object of the Indian sculptor which was to fill the form with the utmost power of spiritual force and significance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The figure of this princely doorkeeper of the temple in its union of calm, grave, sweet and restful serenity with a latent and restrained heroic energy in its stillness, noted by the writer as the distinctive power of this creation, is indeed equal, as he suggests, in its dignity and repose to any Greek statue, but it carries in it a more profound and potent meaning; it is a perfect interpretation of the still and intense Godward feeling, seized in one deep mood, in one fixed moment of it, which was the soul of the great ages of Indian religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There is here a perfection of form with a perfection of significance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This restraint in power, this contained fullness opening an amplitude of infinite suggestion, is not rare or exceptional, it is a frequent greatness in the art of India<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1581" href="#">2</a>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2383"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The second article on Garuda in Bengal and Java by Akshaya Kumar Maitreya, besides its interesting and discerning treatment of its subject, the inception and humanising of the Garuda figure and the artistic use of the mythus, touches an issue which has not yet, I think, received sufficient consideration, the place of the art of Gauda in the development of the spirit of Indian sculpture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The putting side by side of the two sculptures from Java and Varendra, on one side the heroic force, majesty, dignity and beauty of the ancient art in one of its finest developments, on the other the moved nobility, grace and loveliness and the fervour of spiritual emotion and tenderness of a time when the antique Aryan spirit was softening into the sweetness of the religions of bhakti, makes of itself an illuminating suggestion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 592</p>
<p class="PE"> This sculpture is eloquent of that transition and the art of Gauda with its lyrical sweetness of emotion and, at its best, suggestive depths, begins the curve of the stream of spiritual feeling which came down through the Vaishnava art and poetry, found its most gracious and lucid embodiment in the poets of Bengal, has now taken, enriched by new elements, a large and living development in the lyrics of Tagore and the paintings of the Calcutta school and has yet a vital part to play in the spiritual future of India.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2384"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Another article contains a full and discriminating account, copiously illustrated by numerous figures, of the history of the Kirtimukha, a standing feature in Indian architecture, and the development of its use as a constant decorative element and in Java a prominent structural motive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The right understanding of these details is a necessary equipment for the complete comprehension of the art of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The writer handles his subject with a consummate mastery and includes in a small compass all that is needed to give us a full idea about this “glory face”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The one thing not included in his intention is its psychological significance, a question of great interest, for it is an evolution as the writer indicates from an element common to the ancient art of Asia and there were kindred things in Greece and mediaeval Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is the result, I would suggest, of an imagination or an experience that has entered into the subtle worlds and found there a side of things dangerous and distorted and terrible that have yet to be compelled by the adventure of the self-conquering spirit into an element of divine harmony and significance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2385"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The remaining article by Mr. E. Vredenburg on the continuity of pictorial tradition in the art of India treats a question of the most central importance and brings to it a fine aesthetic instinct even more necessary than historic and archaeological accuracy of information in such a discussion, for one may have the latter and yet miss the truth for lack of a more essential equipment of the art critic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Mr. Vredenburg enters a still much-needed protest against the constant tendency to attribute a foreign origin to whatever survives of Indian creation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The instances he gives are indeed evidences of an extraordinary perversity of judgment, such as the well-known refusal to leave the credit of the Tajmahal </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 593</p>
<p class="PE"> to India, “the numerous attempts that have been made to ascribe the Ajanta paintings to the Greeks, Persians or Chinese”, and last but not least colossally absurd, “the truly astounding statement that the Kangra paintings are of European inspiration and that they were painted for the English market”!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Only yesterday while reading Mr. Jouveau-Dubreuil’s able historical monograph I found myself brought up short by the sweepingly positive but hardly judicial and certainly not judicious statement that “the Deccan like the North was inspired by the Greek and Roman arts and the marbles of Amaravati can be compared to the sculptures of Gandhara”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The plain fact is that whatever outside influences there may or may not have been in India as elsewhere, even the earliest work shows a characteristic Indian mentality and touch; and, as for Gandharan art, it has the air of an inefficient attempt of the Hellenistic mind to absorb this spirit rather than an effort of India to imitate Greece.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>And in any case the great characteristic work could no more have been the creation of a foreign mind or of its influence than the sculptures of Phidias can be attributed to an Assyrian, Egyptian or Chinese origin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>A psychological insensibility to the spiritual significance of Indian work is probably at the root of these errors and, so long as that subsists, the most erudite knowledge will be no protection against gross misunderstandings.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1582" href="#">3</a><!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2390"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The subject of this book is one which stands nowadays put away under a sort of intellectual ban, placed on it some centuries ago by the scientific and rationalistic European mind and not yet lifted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Mr. N. P. Subramania Iyer has undertaken an astrological series which will deal with the various parts of astrology, and the present volume contains the text and translation of the <i>Kalaprakasika</i>, a treatise on the selection of the right times by astrological rule for undertaking any and every action of human life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The book is well printed and got up, the translation admirably done in a style free enough to avoid all awkwardness, — the author has a thorough control of the English tongue and an excellent style of his own, — but perfectly faithful to the matter of the text.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But the most interesting part of the work for the ordinary reader is the introduction, in which he gives amidst other matter the psychological explanation of the influence of the planets and states for what they stand in relation to the Indian Vedantic philosophy of existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I have not seen elsewhere any exposition of the subject equally original and illuminative.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2391"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Astrology is in the general mind associated with that class of subjects which goes under the name of the occult, and along with others of its class it has long been discredited by modern “enlightenment”, one does not quite know on what grounds or with what rational justification.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It has its psychic and mystical side, but that is not its ordinary presentation; there it claims to be a science like any other with fixed processes and an exact and definite system of rules which ought to be perfectly capable of verification or of disproof by experiment and induction like </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 596</p>
<p class="PE"> any other science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Its basis is astronomical and mathematical, its data perfectly open and positive and in no way hidden or occult, nor does it at all shrink back from the test or hide itself in secrecy and mystery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It does not indeed give ordinarily the why, but only the how of the causes and effects it professes to establish, but so it is with all other sciences; they do not give the reason of things, but only their processes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Yet astrology is supposed at some indefinite time in the march of human mind to have been exploded, — along with such things as witchcraft and demonology, not to speak of the existence of spirits and the immortality of the soul, — and there is a sort of idea that it has been disproved and therefore put aside as a superstition which no reasonable man can even look at except with a lofty disdain, much less stoop to investigate with an open mind its truth or falsity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Still the anathema of Science has not been able to destroy it; in Europe it has revived, even though its practice as a profession is punishable by the law, and in India it has always survived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is not indeed the habit of educated Indians to profess explicitly their belief in it, they fight shy of that as a rule, but it is largely consulted by numbers of them, as also by many Europeans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This is an anomalous position which ought to be corrected.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Either astrology is a true science and should be investigated, proved, improved where defective and generally rehabilitated in opinion, or else it is a pseudo-science and should be investigated and disproved so as to cut the ground away finally from all secret belief or open credulity.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2392"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>As a matter of fact astrology has never been scientifically disproved, nor has any rational ground ever been advanced for treating it as a pseudo-science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It simply came to be assumed at a certain period and under certain intellectual influences that it was a childish superstition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Or if there were any grounds, then it was left aside because astrologers were charlatans, because many, perhaps most predictions went wrong, but most of all because it was thought that in the nature of things, in any rational theory of the universe the planets simply could not have any influence on our characters, lives and actions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>None of these<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1583" href="#">2</a> grounds are sufficient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>If many astrologers are charlatans, so also </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 597</p>
<p class="PE"> have there been many quacks in the field of medicine; at one time indeed not only did they pullulate, but the system of medicine itself seemed so defective that there were plenty of clear and enlightened minds who were inclined with Molière to denounce the whole thing as a gross pseudo-science, an elaborate and solemn system of ignorance, humbug and quackery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Supposing that view had prevailed, — it could not, merely because men are too vitally interested in healing their ailments and preserving their bodies and know no other way of doing it, — that would not have done away with the truth underlying the science.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2393"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>That many predictions go wrong, proves nothing, essentially, against astrology any more than the constant failure of doctors to heal diseases proves anything essential against their science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The first reason of this failure may be that a great number of practising astrologers are either charlatans who seek to please their clients rather than predict by scientific rule, — of that kind there are perhaps many, — or else inefficient and ignorant men who practise only by rule of thumb, perfunctorily and with a main eye upon their fees.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But if even capable astrologers fail often, that also only proves that either the science or their way of treating it is largely empirical or that some of its rules and theories may be errors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>But every science has to pass through its empirical stage and some — as, again, the science of medicine, — have hardly emerged from it, and every science too burdens itself in its progress with false generalisations, incorrect theories and imperfect rules which have afterwards to be discarded or amended.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>As the main point in medicine is whether herbs and metals and other remedies have or have not certain effects on the body and whether their workings can be substantiated by experience in a sufficient number of cases to establish a regular relation of cause and effect, so it is in astrology with the fundamental question of planetary influences upon earth and its creatures.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2394"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The <i>a priori</i> argument from the rational theory of the universe cannot stand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>There is nothing essentially irrational in the idea that in this solar system, so closely linked together, there may be mutual influences of all the planets upon each other or </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 598</p>
<p class="PE"> that the beings of a particular planet are powerfully influenced or even dominated by influences from the others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The question remains, the <i>a priori</i> rationality being admitted or at least not summarily dismissed, first, whether it is so in fact and, secondly, how far those influences go and of what nature they are.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Astrology affirms that they not only affect our bodies, but also our psychical being.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>If matter and mind were entirely independent entities having no influence or determining effect upon each other, then such a result could not be; but that is not the case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>According to the materialistic view of the universe which claims to be the sole rationalistic view, mind is itself an effect of matter and all its states and movements are determined by matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>There is nothing then impossible, planetary influence being once admitted, in the action of material bodies producing psychical conditions on the earth and thereby determining our psychical states and movements.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>In a more truly rationalistic view mind and matter are always influencing and determining each other; here too, given a universal mind and matter so acting upon individual matter and mind, the movements of the planetary system may be one or even the first nodus of their activities, and the assertions of astrology become at least primarily credible.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2395"><!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Farther, astrology affirms that these influences determine the whole course of our lives and that the all-important element is time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>That raises the major question of the influence of Time upon human beings and events; does Time determine the course of our lives and the states of our being and, if so, how far and in what way?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Or to put the question more precisely, as it is raised by astrology, do or can the conditions reigning at a given critical time, in this case the moment of birth, determine our physical and psychological conditions and the whole course of our future lives, or determine them to any considerable extent? and are the relative movements and therefore the mutual positions of the sun<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1584" href="#">3</a> and planets with regard to the earth and each other either the nodus or in some way the effective signs of these determinations?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>And, secondly, do the developing time conditions which come afterwards, by themselves or viewed in reference to the original conditions, determine from moment to moment, from time to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 599</p>
<p class="PE"> time the subsequent evolution of our primary physical and psychological conditions and the course of linked and successive circumstances which make up the history of our lives? and if so, again, are the relative movements and mutual positions of the sun and planets at any given time the nodus or the effective signs of this later determination also? can they therefore be taken for all practical purposes as determinants, or at any rate as sure signs by which the determinations of our life and being can be discovered?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>That is the question which astrology raises, and it is evidently a perfectly legitimate and rational question; nor can we on <i>a priori</i> grounds condemn and put away an affirmative answer, which is based upon past experience systematised into rules and theories, as a superstition or a childish folly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Granted that in things here there is a chain of cause and effect — or at least, if causality is disputed, of antecedent condition leading up to subsequent condition — and that if and so far as we know that chain, scientific prediction becomes in that proportion possible, — two propositions which, unless we deny determination altogether, it would be difficult to dispute, — there is no inherent improbability in the clue to happenings human and other on the planets being found in the motions of those planets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Astronomy is in a sense the primary physical science, for the first facts which give all the others their field are astronomical facts; it may well be that in the psycho-physical field the same rule holds and that there the first facts may be astrological.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2396"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>The <i>a priori</i> objections disappearing, the next step is to ask ourselves whether there is a sufficient <i>prima facie</i> empirical case for enquiring<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1585" href="#">4</a> into the actual truth of astrology.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>This at present depends upon the experience of isolated individuals, a very unsatisfactory basis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>But if this experience could be collected, sifted and published, I believe it would be found that a formidable <i>prima facie</i> case exists in favour of astrology, much stronger than that which encouraged the Society for Psychical Research to carry on its work in another psycho-physical field to such important conclusions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>I may state my own experience in the matter in the belief, justified by many instances, that it is only typical of the experience of hundreds of others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>My first accidental contact </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 600</p>
<p class="PE"> with an Indian astrologer was not encouraging.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>This gentleman was the most accomplished thought-reader I have ever seen; for he asked me to think my question without speaking it and not only successfully named the unspoken question I had fixed on, but three others which had crossed my mind, one of them only in the merest flash and without leaving any impression behind: this he pretended to do by mathematical calculation, an operation which I took leave to regard as humbug or professional parade.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>For when it came to his answers, I found that he was still doing thought-reading and not astrology; he simply echoed the hopes or thoughts in my mind and his predictions did not come within one hundred miles of the truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Other practitioners I have found to belong, a few plainly to the class of mere flattering charlatans, but most to the inefficient who read by rule of thumb and have made no profound study of their science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>On the other hand, with capable astrologers the results have been often of such a remarkable accuracy as to put quite aside any possibility of chance hit, mere coincidence, intelligent prevision or any of the current explanations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>I may instance the father of a friend of mine, a deep student of the science but not a professional, who predicted accurately the exact year, month, day, hour and even minute of his own death.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>In my own case accuracy was hampered by the inability to fix the precise moment of my birth; still some of the results were extraordinary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Two may be mentioned, from one and the same astrologer, which related to my public career.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>One, given when I had not yet plunged into the political vortex and my then obscure personality was quite unknown to the astrologer, predicted as an inevitable certitude of the future a political struggle with powerful non-Indian adversaries during which for a time even my life would fall under the shadow of danger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>The other, given at the time of my first prosecution in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case, predicted three successive criminal trials in each of which the prosecution would fail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>I may instance also two predictions by the book in which slokas from Sanskrit astrological writings indicating the results<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1586" href="#">5</a> of certain conjunctions or planetary positions were shown to be applicable to my horoscope.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>One foretold specific chronic illnesses for the body <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> of which there was no sign at the time, but long afterwards they put in their unexpected appearance and persisted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Another indicated very precisely that one of my future activities would be to found a new spiritual philosophy and its discipline; at that time I had no knowledge of philosophy or Yoga and no turn or inclination in my mind which could make the realisation of this prediction at all probable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>These are only the most precise examples out of a number.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Supposing all well-authenticated evidence of the kind to be collected, I am convinced there would be an overwhelmingly strong <i>prima facie</i> case and even a body of sufficiently strong empirical proof to establish at least a nucleus of truth in astrology.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2397"><!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>That would be the first step.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>For if astrology is a science and is to take its proper place, the first necessity is to dissipate by an appeal to the empirical mind of the general public as well as of the sceptical thinker the great mass of unenquiring prejudice which now exists against it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>To publish the text and translation of the best authorities, as Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Iyer is now doing, with illuminating introductions is a preliminary need in this case so that we may know what we have to go upon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>The second is to mass evidence of the empirical truth of the science, giving in each case the prediction in all its details, the more detailed the better, the astrological rules on which it was based and the event, each detail of the event being compared with the corresponding detail of the prediction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Only then would there be a clear field for the consideration of the scientific and philosophical doubts, questions and problems which would still arise; but this, though the most important aspect of the matter, I must leave for future handling.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2398"><!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>An acceptance of the truth of astrology would not necessarily carry with it a complete determinism of Fate or mechanical law of Karma.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2401"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The appearance of this Anglo-Sanskrit Quarterly “devoted to research work in all fields of Indian Antiquity” is a welcome sign of the recent development towards a wider culture, a more flexible and strenuous scholarship and a more original thinking which promises to lift the Indian mind out of the rut of secondhand provincialism and sterile repetition of commonplaces into which the vices of its school and university education had betrayed it and to equip it for the important contribution we may expect it to make to the world’s increasing stock of knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>There has been a considerable expansion in this country, both in English and the vernaculars, of that ordinary periodical literature which caters for the popular mind and supplies it with snippets of knowledge, facile information and ready but not always very valuable opinions on all sorts of subjects.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE">The second (October) number of the Quarterly is before me and its sound editing and the value and interest of its contents promise well for its future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>There are especially two very solid articles, one by Mr. Tilak on “A Missing Verse in the Sankhya Karikas”, and another by Professor R. D. Ranade of the Ferguson College headed “Greek and Sanskrit: a Comparative Study”, but there is no article without its interest and value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>I note that in this number all the contributors, with one exception, are either from Maharashtra or the Madras Presidency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is to be hoped that the editor will be able to secure the cooperation of Sanskrit scholars in the north so that this Review may become an All-India organ of Indian research.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2403"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak’s article shows all the thoroughness and acuteness which that great scholar brings to his work great or small whether he is seeking for the original home of the Aryans in the cryptic mass of the Rig Veda or restoring with his rare powers of deduction a lost verse in the Karikas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The point he seeks to establish, though apparently a small one, has really a considerable importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>He points out that there is a consensus of authority for the existence of 70 verses in Ishwarakrishna’s Sankhya-Karikas, but, if we exclude the last three which do not belong to the doctrinal part of the text, we have both in the Indian text and in the Chinese version only 69; at the same time he shows that both Gaudapada’s Bhashya and the commentary in the Chinese version contain a passage developing a refutation of four possible subtler causes of the world, Ishwara, Purusha, Kala and Swabhava (God, the Soul, Time and Nature) rejected by the Sankhyas, a refutation which logically ought to be but is not found in the text itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>From the passage in the Bhashya he seeks to reestablish the sense and even the language of the missing verse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It seems to me that he has established both the fact of the missing verse and its substance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But the interesting point is the reason assigned by him for the loss of the verse; it was, he thinks, no accident, but a deliberate suppression made at a time when the Sankhya philosophy was being re-explained by thinkers like Vijnanabhikshu in a Vedantic sense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If so, the point made sheds a very </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 605</p>
<p class="PE"> interesting light on the historic course of philosophical thought in India.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2404"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The general line which that development followed arises more indirectly from an interesting and carefully reasoned article by Mr. Y. Subbarao on the question of the originality of Shankara’s philosophy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Mr. Subbarao seeks to establish his point that it was no new system of thought which Shankara created, but only the re-statement perhaps in a more developed form of a very ancient school of Vedantic interpretation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Certainly, it cannot be supposed that Shankara invented a new philosophy out of his own brain; he believed himself to be establishing against attack the real sense of the Vedantic philosophy founded on the original texts of its canon and supported by the best tradition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Nor does any greater thinker really invent a system new-born from his own intellect; what he does is to take up the material available to him in the past history of thought, to choose, select, reject, to present new lights<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1587" href="#">2</a> on old ideas, to develop latent suggestions, to bring into prominence what was before less prominent or not so trenchant and definite, to give a fresh, striking and illuminating sense to old terms, to combine what was before not at all or else ill-combined; in doing so he creates; his philosophy, though not new in its materials, is new in the whole effect it produces and the more powerful light that in certain directions it conveys to the thinking mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The question is whether Shankara’s system was not new in this sense and, though the previous material still subsisting is insufficient to decide the question, it must, I think, be answered provisionally in the affirmative.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>In such synthetic and intuitive philosophies truths are arranged according to the place of each in the actual fact of things, as different laws and generalisations are arranged in Science, each positive in its own field and each having its proper relation to the others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The perfection of this method is to be found in the Upanishads and the Gita; and that is the reason why all attempts to interpret these great works by the methods of logical debate and the rigorous exclusions dear to the analytic metaphysician always fail even in the strongest hands; they raise questions about the sense of these works which cannot be conclusively solved, but must necessarily lead to eternal debate, because the method is wrong and the original work itself never intended to cause or countenance such discussions.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>He has had to allow himself only a very small space for so large and important a subject, but within these narrow limits he has done his work with great thoroughness and, subject to a few minor reservations, with a minute accuracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is to be regretted that by printing the Greek words in their proper character instead of in Roman type Mr. Ranade has made this interesting essay unintelligible to all but a very few Indian readers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>He lays down the principle that the words of each language should be printed in its own type and that anyone who wishes to study Comparative Philology must take the trouble to familiarise himself with the original alphabets.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 608</p>
<p class="PE"> array of grammatical and syntactical identities between the two languages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>I do not understand in the first place what is meant by the statement that “in Greek no difference is made between the dentals and the linguals and they are <i>fused</i> together.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>If it is meant that the Greek language possessed both dental and lingual sounds but expressed them by the same characters, I do not think this can be correct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The distribution of dentals and linguals in the various languages is one of the most curious phenomena in the history of linguistic phonetics and deserves a closer inquiry than has been accorded to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The Latin and Celtic languages reject the lingual and use only the dental; English on the other hand prefers the linguals, though it uses occasionally the dental <i>t</i>, <i>th</i> and <i>d</i>, all of which it represents by <i>th</i>, as in <i>with</i>, <i>thin</i>, <i>though</i>, — a desperately clumsy device thoroughly in keeping with the chaotic wildness of English orthography.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Everyone in India knows the difficulty an Englishman finds in pronouncing the Indian dentals; he turns them resolutely into linguals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>On the contrary a Frenchman who has not educated himself into the right English pronunciation, will turn the English lingual into a dental; he will say <i>feasth</i> instead of <i>feast</i>, <i>noth</i> instead of <i>not</i>, and pronounce <i>do</i> as if it were the English <i>though</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>A similar peculiarity is one of the chief features of the brogue, the Irish mispronunciation of English speech; for the natural Irish tongue cannot manage the hard lingual sound in such words as <i>Peter</i> and <i>shoulder</i>, it mollifies them into true dentals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>I have noticed the same peculiarity in the pronunciation of a Spanish actress playing in English on a London stage; otherwise perfect, it produced a strange impression by its invariable transformation of the harder English into the softer Latin sound.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>Now Greek must certainly have belonged to the Latin-Celtic group in this phonetic peculiarity; otherwise the difference would have been too striking to escape the sensitive ear of the ancient poets and scholars.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It seems to me therefore that in the comparative scheme of the two alphabets the Sanskrit linguals should be marked as absent in the Greek and, not as Mr. Ranade represents them, correspondent equally with the dentals to the Greek <i>tau</i>, <i>theta</i>, and <i>delta</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE">In the comparison of the declensions Mr. Ranade asserts that Greek feminine nouns in long <i>a</i> like <i>chōrā</i> correspond in their endings to Sanskrit nouns of the type of <span class="devan">bhāryā</span> and Greek nouns in long <i>e</i> like <i>tīmē</i> to Sanskrit nouns of the type of <span class="devan">dāsī</span>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Surely this is an error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The writer has fallen into it because he was looking only at the Attic dialect, but the Attic is only one variation of the Greek language and it is misleading to study it by itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>As a matter of fact, this <i>ā</i> and this <i>ē</i> both represent the same original sound which must have been the feminine termination in <i>ā</i>; only the Doric dialect prefers always the original <i>ā</i>, the Ionic modifies it into <i>ē</i>, and the Attic standing between the Doric and the Ionic belts makes a compromise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>In the Attic when this feminine <i>ā</i> is preceded by a vowel it remains unmodified, as also usually when it is preceded by <i>r</i>, but if it is preceded by a consonant it becomes <i>ē</i>; thus <i>philiā</i>, <i>chōrā</i>, but

<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>The power of the Greek language to make compounds is one of its most notable characteristics and its rich though never intemperate use is one of the great beauties of the Greek poetical style.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>When the Romans came into contact with Greek literature, their earlier poets tried to introduce this faculty into Latin and even Virgil describes the sea as <i>velivolum</i>, sail-flying, i.e. with sails flying over it like the wings of birds through the air, but the usage was too contrary to the Latin genius to succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>Not only did the Greek compound prepositions with its verbs, but it compounded nouns and verbs together.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>Thus from <i>nau-archos</i>, ship-ruler, i.e. admiral, they made <i>nau-archein</i>, to be an admiral; nor did they hesitate before such forms as <i>paido-poiein</i>, to beget children, <i>paido-tribein</i>, to train boys, <i>mnēsikakein</i>, to remember wrongs, <i>neotto-tropheisthai</i>, to be brought up like the young of a bird.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>One is a little dazzled at first and has to accustom the eyes to the glitter, before one can turn to the heart of the meaning: excess, profusion, an unwearied lavishing of treasures creates the charm of the manner as well as its limitations, but this is often an excellent sign in a young poet, for it promises much richness in the hour of maturity; and here it is almost always, — not quite always, for there are lapses, — a fine, though not yet a sovereign excess, which continually attracts and stimulates the imagination, if it does not always quite take it captive.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The image-maker’s faculty is used with a radiant splendour and lavishness, but without discrimination; what begins as imaginative vision frequently thins away into a bright play of fancy, and there are lines which come dangerously near to prettiness and conceit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Especially there is not yet that sufficient incubation of the inspiration and the artistic sense which turns a poem into a perfectly satisfying artistic whole; even in the Sonnets, beautiful enough in themselves, there is an insufficient force of structure.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">“Shama’a”</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2492"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>I was unable to greet duly the first appearance of this new magazine of art, literature and philosophy edited by Miss Mrinalini Chattopadhyay; I take the opportunity of the second number to repair the omission I had then unwillingly to make.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The appearance of this quarterly is one of the signs as yet too few, but still carrying a sure promise, of a progressive reawakening of the higher thinking and aesthetic mentality in India after a temporary effacement in which the Eastern mind was attempting to assimilate in the wrong way elementary or second-rate occidental ideas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>In that misguided endeavour it became on the intellectual and practical side ineffectively utilitarian and on the aesthetic content with the cheap, ugly and vulgar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The things of the West it assimilated were just the things the West had either left behind it or was already finishing and preparing to cast away.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>“Shama’a”, like “Rupam”, though less sumptuously apparelled, is distinguished by its admirable get-up and printing and is an evidence of the recovery of a conscience in the matter of form, a thing once universal in India but dead or dormant since the Western invasion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The plan of the review is designed to meet a very real need of the moment and the future: for its purpose is to bring together in its pages the mind of the Indian renaissance and the most recent developments of European culture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>In India we as yet know next to nothing of what the most advanced minds of Europe are thinking and creating in the literary, artistic and philosophic field, — for that matter most of us, preoccupied with politics and domestic life, have a very inadequate information of what we ourselves are doing in these matters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is to be hoped that this magazine will be an effective agent in curing these deficiencies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It has begun well: the editor, Miss Chattopadhyay, has the needed gift of attracting contributions of the right kind and there is in “Shama’a” as a </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 624</p>
<p class="PE"> result of her skill a pervading and harmonising atmosphere of great distinction and fineness.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2493"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The frontispiece of this number is a portrait by a modern English artist, J. D. Fergusson<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1595" href="#">2</a>, and an article on his work by Charles Marriot is the most interesting of the contributions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It sets out to discover on the basis of the real as opposed to the accidental differences between the Western and the Eastern methods of painting the inner meaning of their divergence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The attempt to create an illusion of reality to the eye, to copy Nature, which was so long a considerable part of the occidental theory is regarded as a passing phase for which the introduction of oil paint gave the occasion, an accidental and not at all an essential difference: European art at the beginning was free from it and is now rejecting this defect or this limitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Nor are other details of method, such as the use of cast shadows as opposed to a reliance on outline, the real difference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>None of these things involve necessarily an illusion of reality, and even where that inartistic fiction does not intervene, as in the Italian fresco and tempera painting and in oil painting that reduces shadow to a minimum and relies on outline, the fundamental difference between the East and the West remains constant and unalterable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The fundamental difference is that the Eastern artist paints in two and the European in three dimensions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Eastern painting suggests depth only by successive planes of distance; the Western artist uses perspective, and while the use of perspective to create an optical illusion is an error, its emphasis on depth as a mental conception extends the opportunities of expressing truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is in any case in the use of the third dimension that there comes in the true and essential difference.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2494"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The writer then attempts to link up this divergence with the concepts of the two continents with regard to life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>He hazards the suggestion that the separate planes of a Chinese landscape correspond to “the doctrine of successive incarnations, of separate planes of existence, each the opportunity for<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1596" href="#">3</a> its own virtues”, and the occidental artist’s “active exploration and exploitation of the ground between the planes of distance” corresponds to the West’s view of this life as a continual discipline, the sole opportunity </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 625</p>
<p class="PE"> for salvation, a battle to be won now and here, and of “material facts . . . not as evils in themselves and . . . opportunities for asceticism and renunciation, but as tests of the spirit, good or bad according as they are used rightly or wrongly”, — an active exploration as opposed to a passive acceptance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>I find it impossible to accept this ingenious idea: it strikes me as a little fanciful in itself, but in any case it is based on a misunderstanding of the Eastern mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The usual Western error is made of confusing one strong tendency of Eastern philosophy for the whole of its thinking and a view of reincarnation is attributed to the East that is not its real view.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The successive rebirths are not to the Eastern mind separate planes of existence, each independently the opportunity of its own virtues, but a closely connected sequence and the action of each life determines the frame and basic opportunities of the following birth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It is a rhythm of progression in which the present is not cut out from but one with the past and future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Life and action are here too and not only in the West tests of the spirit, good or bad according as they are used rightly or wrongly, and it is and must be always this present life that is of immediate and immense importance, though it is not and cannot in reason be final or irreparable: for salvation may be won now, but if there is failure, the soul has still its future chances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>As a matter of historical fact the great periods of Eastern art were not periods of a passive acceptance of life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>In India, the cradle of these philosophies, they coincided with an active exploration of the material universe through physical science and a strong insistence on life, on its government, on the exploration of its every detail, on the call of even its most sensuous and physical attractions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The literature and art of India are not at all a dream of renunciation and the passive acceptance of things, but actively concerned with life, though not as exteriorly as the art of the West or with the same terrestrial limitation of the view.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It is there that we have to seek for the root of the divergence, not so much in the intellectual idea as in a much subtler spiritual difference.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2495"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The difference is that the Western artist, — the Western mind generally, — is led to insist on the physical as the first fact and the determinant, as it is indeed in vital truth and practice, and </p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2496"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Another article of some interest on “Art and History” by John M. Thorburn gives us much writing in an attractive style </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 627</p>
<p class="PE"> and some suggestive ideas, but there is a soft mistiness about both as yet too common in attempts at intuitive thinking and writing which makes it a little difficult to disentangle the ideas and get at their relation and sequence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>The thought turns around rather than deals with national temperament and its shaping influence in art and there is a comparison in this respect between the French and the English<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1599" href="#">6</a> temperament on one side and the German or the Russian on the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>But the attempt does not get deep.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The line taken is that the distinguishing characteristic of the French and English mind are the critical faculty, humour, a sense for character and for the common as well as the uncommon, for detail as well as principle, a power of social adaptation or readaptation, the instinct in the English to carry on, in the French to change and reconstruct, and all these are connected together and are the fruit of Graeco-Roman civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The writer thinks that the Graeco-Roman tradition and its true development in the modern world is the only saving ethical and political ideal, at least for Europe, — a salutary saving clause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>At the same time he has found his highest artistic satisfaction in German music and rates the relative power of Russian literature and possibly the music above the recent artistic work of Europe, and he is perplexed by the coexistence of this superiority with Russia’s social instability and with Germany’s lack of literary humour and of the sense for character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>And, though this reserve is not expressly made, Germany cannot be taxed with lack of the social constructive faculty, seeing that it was the German who in far back times developed the feudal system and has more recently perfected the modern industrial order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>And yet Germany is distinctly outside the Graeco-Roman tradition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>He discovers that Germany lacks the reflective critical faculty, that there is “something in the German artistic and philosophical temperament that is at variance<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1600" href="#">7</a> with social good”, “strangely hostile to the ethical and artistic ideal of Greece or the administrative and harmonising genius of Rome”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Germany is entirely instinctive, at the mercy of her temperament, unable to liberate herself from it, instinctive in her music, her philosophy too an instinctive movement, reflection never able to get outside itself or even to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> feel the need to do so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>As for Russia, hers is the kind of art that is an expression of the division and breaches of human society rather than of its wholeness or its peace, an art born of Nature’s error and not like the French and English of her truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>It seems however that the art born of Nature’s error, of her suffering and ill health is more wonderful and alluring than the art born of her ordered ways.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>After all is said, the truth of Nature is only a partial and defective truth and her error only a partial error: there is no necessary harmony at least in the finite between what we value as goodness and what we value as beauty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>And the solution of all the contradiction is to be sought in the experience of the “effort of the finite spirit to come to a fuller consciousness of itself or . . . of a universe that only uses that spirit as an instrument towards its own self-knowledge, self-perfection or self-interpretation”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>The conclusion is unexceptionable, but the line of thought leading to it stumbles needlessly in pursuit of a false clue.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2497"><!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>The article is interesting chiefly as an indication of the perplexity of a certain type of European mind hesitating and held back in the grasp of the old that is dying and yet feeling the call of things that draw towards the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>The superstition of the perfect excellence of the Graeco-Roman tradition as rendered by England and France — more strictly the Latinised or semi-Latinised mind and the Renaissance tradition — survives: but as a matter of fact that tradition or what remains of it is a dead shell.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The Time-Spirit has left it, retaining no doubt what it needs for its ulterior aims, and is passing on to far other things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>In that evolution Germany and Russia among European nations have taken a leading place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Germany has failed to go the whole way, because to a strong but coarse and heavy vital force and a strict systematising scientific intellect she could not successfully bring in the saving power of intuition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Her music indeed was very great and revolutionised the artistic mind of Europe, not because it was instinctive, but because it was intuitive, — because it brought in a profound intuitive feeling and vision to uplift through the conquered difficulties of a complex harmony a large and powerful intelligence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>Her philosophy was at first a very </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 629</p>
<p class="PE"> great but too drily intellectual statement of truths that get their living meaning only in the intuitive experience, but afterwards in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche as in Wagner it developed the intuitive vision and led to a deep change in European thinking.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>But the life of Germany remained still unaffected by her higher mind, well-organised, systematic but vitally and aesthetically crude, and she has failed to respond to the deepest forces of the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>The stream has turned aside to Russia, Russia deeply intuitive in her emotional and psychic being, moved through her sensibilities and aiding by a sensitive fineness there a yet imperfect but rapidly evolving intuitivity of the intelligence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>It is clear enough that the labour of the soul and mind of Russia has not arrived at victory and harmony, but her malady is the malady and suffering of a great gestation, and her social instability the condition of an effort towards the principle of a greater order than the self-satisfied imperfection of the Graeco-Roman tradition or of the modern social principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>The martyrdom of Russia might from this point of view be regarded as a vicarious sacrifice for the sin of obstinacy in imperfection, the sin of self-retardation of the entire race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>It is at any rate by some large and harmonising view of this kind and not by any paradox of superior values of good and truth resulting in inferior values of beauty and negative values of no good and no truth flowering in superior values of beauty that we are likely best to understand both the effort of the finite spirit and the effort of the universe through it towards its own self-perception and self-interpretation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>Several closely printed pages are given to a critical review of Professor S. Radhakrishnan’s work on the Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore by Mr. J. B. Raju.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>The criticism gives unhappily, in spite of its interest, an impression of ability very badly used, for it is throughout what a criticism of this kind should not be, censorious, hostile, bitterly incisive and sometimes almost brutal in the inimical tone of its phrases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>A philosophic discussion should surely be conducted in a graver and more impersonal tone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_77"><!-- --></a>In addition there is a criticism by dissection so discursively and incoherently minute that it is impossible to form a coherent idea of the thought the work animadverted upon actually does develop.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_78"><!-- --></a>I have not read the book in question, but Professor Radhakrishnan is well known as a perfectly competent philosophic critic and thinker and it is impossible to believe that anything he has written is, as this criticism constantly suggests, a mere mass of imbecile inconsequence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_79"><!-- --></a>I gather that his offence is to have done exactly what he should have done, that is, to represent the thought of Tagore, — who is a poet and not a metaphysical dialectician but an intuitive seer, — as an intuitive whole: the dry-as-dust intellectual formalism of analysis demanded of him by his critic would have been in such a subject grotesquely out of place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_80"><!-- --></a>A still greater offence is that he has endorsed the poet’s exaltation of the claims of intuition as superior, at least in a certain field, to those of the intellect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_81"><!-- --></a>Mr. Raju seems to think that this claim consecrates “a mistaken and obsolete psychology”, the infatuation of “a </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_83"><!-- --></a>What then are we to make of Bergson’s intuition, James’ cosmic consciousness, Eucken’s superconscient, the remarkable trend towards mysticism of recent scientists, mathematicians, thinkers, the still more remarkable speculations of contemporary Russian philosophers?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_84"><!-- --></a>These men at least are not irresponsible poets or incompetent dupes of the imagination, but psychologists of the first rank and the most original contemporary thinkers in the philosophic field.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_85"><!-- --></a>Mr. Raju’s defence of the claims of the reason is well enough written, but it is founded on contentions that once were commonplaces but are now very disputable assertions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_86"><!-- --></a>Indeed, if the most recent thought has any value, he is himself open to the retort of his own remark that he is the victim of a mistaken and obsolete psychology.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_87"><!-- --></a>Mr. Raju may be right, the modern psychologists and philosophers may be wrong, but the time has passed when the claims of intuition could be dismissed with this high, disdainful lightness.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2500"><!--SENT--><a name="s_89"><!-- --></a>The review contains some poetry but, Mr. R. C. Bonnerji’s gracious and cultured verses apart, all is of the aggressively modern type.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_90"><!-- --></a>There are a number of poems taken or quoted from the American journal <i>Poetry</i> that are one and all of the same stereotyped kind of free verse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_91"><!-- --></a>Eleanor Hammond’s “Transition” turns upon a pretty emotion and Evelyn Scott’s “Fear” on an idea with fine possibilities, but as usual in this kind the style has no trace of any poetic turn or power but only a tamely excited and childlikely direct primitive sincerity and the rhythm is more aggressively prosaic than any honest prose rhythm could manage to be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_92"><!-- --></a>C. L.’s “All was His!” is good in thought and conscientious in style but the rhythm is hopelessly stumbling and lame: but then perhaps it is written on some new metrical principle, — one never knows in these days.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>His first great step associated him in a pioneer work whose motive was to educate the people for a new life under the new conditions, — on the one side a purely educational movement of which the fruit was the Ferguson College, fitly founding the reawakening of the country by an effort of which co-operation in self-sacrifice was the moving spirit, on the other the initiation of the <i>Kesari</i> newspaper, which since then has figured increasingly as the characteristic and powerful expression of the political mind of Maharashtra.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>His separation from the social reform leader, Agarkar, had opened the way for the peculiar role which he has played as a trusted and accredited leader of conservative and religious India in the paths of democratic politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It was this position which enabled him to effect the union of the new political spirit with the tradition and sentiment of the historic past and of both with the ineradicable religious temperament of the people, of which these festivals were the symbol.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The Congress movement was for a long time purely occidental in its mind, character and methods, confined to the English-educated few, founded on the political rights and interests of the people read in the light of English history and European ideals, but with no roots either in the past of the country or in the inner spirit of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak was the first political leader to break through the routine of its somewhat academical methods, to bridge the gulf between the present and the past and to restore continuity to the political life of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>He developed a language and a spirit and he used methods which Indianised the movement and brought into it the masses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>To his work of this period we owe that really living, strong and spontaneously organised movement in Maharashtra, which has shown its energy and sincerity in more than one crisis and struggle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>This divination of the mind and spirit of his people and its needs and this power to seize on the right way to call it forth prove strikingly the political genius of Mr. Tilak; they made him the one man predestined to lead them in this trying and difficult period when all has to be discovered and all has to be reconstructed.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The second found him already the inspiring power of a great reawakening of the Maratha spirit; it left him an uncrowned king in the Deccan and gave him that high reputation throughout India which was the foundation-stone of his present commanding influence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The last found him the leader of an All-India party, the foremost exponent and head of a thoroughgoing Nationalism; it sent him back to be one of the two or three foremost men of India adored and followed by the whole nation.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 652</p>
<p class="PE">Moreover in India, owing to the divorce of political activity from the actual government and administration of the affairs of the country, an academical turn of thought is too common in our dealings with politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_111"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Tilak has never been an academical politician, a “student of politics” meddling with action; his turn has always been to see actualities and move forward in their light.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_112"><!-- --></a>It was impossible for him to view the facts and needs of current Indian politics of the nineteenth century in the pure serene or the dim religious light of the Witenagemot and the Magna Charta and the constitutional history of England during the past seven centuries, or to accept the academic sophism of a gradual preparation for liberty, or merely to discuss isolated or omnibus grievances and strive to enlighten the darkness of the official mind by luminous speeches and resolutions, as was the general practice of Congress politics till 1905.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_113"><!-- --></a>A national agitation in the country which would make the Congress movement a living and acting force was always his ideal, and what the Congress would not do, he, when still an isolated leader of a handful of enthusiasts in a corner of the country, set out to do in his own strength and for his own hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_114"><!-- --></a>He saw from the first that for a people circumstanced like ours there could be only one political question and one aim, not the gradual improvement of the present administration into something in the end fundamentally the opposite of itself, but the early substitution of Indian and national for English and bureaucratic control in the affairs of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_115"><!-- --></a>A subject nation does not prepare itself by gradual progress for liberty; it opens by liberty its way to rapid progress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_116"><!-- --></a>The only progress that has to be made in the preparation for liberty, is progress in the awakening of the national spirit and in the creation of the will to be free and the will to adopt the necessary means and bear the necessary sacrifices for liberty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_117"><!-- --></a>It is these clear perceptions that have regulated his political career.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2537"><!--SENT--><a name="s_118"><!-- --></a>Therefore the whole of the first part of his political life was devoted to a vigorous and living propaganda for the reawakening and solidifying of the national life of Maharashtra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_119"><!-- --></a>Therefore, too, when the Swadeshi agitation gave the first opportunity of a large movement in the same sense throughout India, he </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 653</p>
<p class="PE"> seized on it with avidity, while his past work in Maharashtra, his position as the leader of a small advanced section in the old Congress politics and his character, sacrifices and sufferings at once fixed the choice of the New Party on him as their predestined leader.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_120"><!-- --></a>The same master-idea made him seize on the four main points which the Bengal agitation had thrown into some beginning of practical form, Swaraj, Swadeshi, National Education and Boycott, and formulate them into a definite programme, which he succeeded in introducing among the resolutions of the Congress at the Calcutta session, — much to the detriment of the uniformity of sage and dignified impotence which had characterised the august, useful and calmly leisurely proceedings of that temperate national body.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_121"><!-- --></a>We all know the convulsion that followed the injection of this foreign matter; but we must see why Mr. Tilak insisted on administering annually so potent a remedy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_122"><!-- --></a>The four resolutions were for him the first step towards shaking the Congress out of its torpid tortoise-like gait and turning it into a living and acting body.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2538"><!--SENT--><a name="s_123"><!-- --></a>Swaraj, complete and early self-government in whatever form, had the merit in his eyes of making definite and near to the national vision the one thing needful, the one aim that mattered, the one essential change that includes all the others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_124"><!-- --></a>No nation can develop a living enthusiasm or accept great action and great sacrifices for a goal that is lost to its eye in the mist of far-off centuries; it must see it near and distinct before it, magnified by a present hope, looming largely and actualised as a living aim whose early realisation only depends on a great, sustained and sincere effort.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_125"><!-- --></a>National education meant for him the training of the young generation in the new national spirit to be the architects of liberty, if that was delayed, the citizens of a free India which had rediscovered itself, if the preliminary conditions were rapidly fulfilled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_126"><!-- --></a>Swadeshi meant an actualising of the national self-consciousness and the national will and the readiness to sacrifice which would fix them in the daily mind and daily life of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_127"><!-- --></a>In Boycott, which was only a popular name for passive resistance, he saw the means to give to the struggle between the two ideas in conflict, bureaucratic control </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 654</p>
<p class="PE"> and national control, a vigorous shape and body and to the popular side a weapon and an effective form of action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_128"><!-- --></a>Himself a man of organisation and action, he knew well that by action most, and not by thought and speech alone, can the will of a people be vivified, trained and made solid and enduring.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_129"><!-- --></a>To get a sustained authority from the Congress for a sustained effort in these four directions seemed to him of capital importance; this was the reason for his inflexible insistence on their unchanged inclusion when the programme seemed to him to be in danger.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2539"><!--SENT--><a name="s_130"><!-- --></a>Yet also, because he is a practical politician and a man of action, he has always, so long as the essentials were safe, been ready to admit any change in name or form or any modification of programme or action dictated by the necessities of the time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_131"><!-- --></a>Thus during the movement of 1905 – 1910 the Swadeshi leader and the Swadeshi party insisted on agitation in India and discouraged reliance on agitation in England, because the awaking and fixing of a self-reliant<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1611" href="#">5</a> national spirit and will in India was the one work for the hour and in England no party or body of opinion existed which would listen to the national claim, nor could exist, — as anybody with the least knowledge of English politics could have told, — until that claim had been unmistakably and insistently made and was clearly supported by the fixed will of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_132"><!-- --></a>The Home Rule leader and the Home Rule party of today, which is only the “New Party” reborn with a new name, form and following, insist on the contrary on vigorous and speedy agitation in England, because the claim and the will have both been partially, but not sufficiently recognised, and because a great and growing British party now exists which is ready to make the Indian ideal part of its own programme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_133"><!-- --></a>So, too, they insisted then on Swaraj and rejected with contempt all petty botching with the administration, because so alone could the real issue be made a living thing to the nation; now they accept readily enough a fairly advanced but still half-and-half scheme, but always with the proviso that the popular principle receives substantial embodiment and the full ideal is included as an early goal and not put off to a far-distant future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_134"><!-- --></a>The leader of men in war or politics will always distrust petty and episodical </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 655</p>
<p class="PE"> gains which, while giving false hopes, are merely nominal and put off or even endanger the real issue, but will always seize on any advantage which brings decisive victory definitely nearer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_135"><!-- --></a>It is only the pure idealist, — but let us remember that he too has his great and indispensable uses, — who insists always on either all or nothing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_136"><!-- --></a>Not revolutionary methods or revolutionary idealism, but the clear sight and the direct propaganda and action of the patriotic political leader insisting on the one thing needful and the straight way to drive at it, have been the sense of Mr. Tilak’s political career.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2540"><!--SENT--><a name="s_137"><!-- --></a>The speeches in this book belong both to the Swadeshi and the Home Rule periods, but mostly to the latter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_138"><!-- --></a>They show Mr. Tilak’s mind and policy and voice with great force that will and political thought now dominant in the country which he has so prominently helped to create.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_139"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak has none of the gifts of the orator which many lesser men have possessed, but his force of thought and personality make him in his own way a powerful speaker.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_140"><!-- --></a>He is at his best in his own Marathi tongue rather than in English; for there he finds always the apt and telling phrase, the striking application, the vigorous figure which go straight home to the popular mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_141"><!-- --></a>But there is essentially the same power in both.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_142"><!-- --></a>His words have the directness and force — no force can be greater — of a sincere and powerful mind always going immediately to the aim in view, the point before it, expressing it with a bare, concentrated economy of phrase and the insistence of the hammer full on the head of the nail which drives it in with a few blows.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_143"><!-- --></a>But the speeches have to be read with his life, his character, his life-long aims as their surrounding atmosphere.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_144"><!-- --></a>That is why I have dwelt on their main points; — not that all I have said is not well known, but the repetition of known facts has its use when they are important and highly significant.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2541"><!--SENT--><a name="s_145"><!-- --></a>Two facts of his life and character have to be insisted on as of special importance to the country because they give a great example of two things in which its political life was long deficient and is even now not sufficient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_146"><!-- --></a>First, the inflexible will of the patriot and man of sincere heart and thorough action </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 656</p>
<p class="PE"> which has been the very grain of his character: for aspirations, emotion, enthusiasm are nothing without this; will alone creates and prevails.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_147"><!-- --></a>And wish and will are not the same thing, but divided by a great gulf: the one, which is all most of us get to, is a puny, tepid and inefficient thing and, even when most enthusiastic, easily discouraged and turned from its object; the other can be a giant to accomplish and endure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_148"><!-- --></a>Secondly, the readiness to sacrifice and face suffering, not needlessly or with a useless bravado, but with a firm courage when it comes, to bear it and to outlive, returning to work with one’s scars as if nothing had happened.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_149"><!-- --></a>No prominent man in India has suffered more for his country; none has taken his sacrifices and sufferings more quietly and as a matter of course.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2542"><!--SENT--><a name="s_150"><!-- --></a>The first part of Mr. Tilak’s life-work is accomplished.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_151"><!-- --></a>Two great opportunities have hastened its success, of which he has taken full advantage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_152"><!-- --></a>The lavalike flood of the Swadeshi movement fertilised the soil and did for the country in six years the work of six ordinary decades; it fixed the goal of freedom in the mind of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_153"><!-- --></a>The sudden irruption of Mrs. Besant into the field with her unequalled gift, — born of her untiring energy, her flaming enthusiasm, her magnificent and magnetic personality, her spiritual force, — for bringing an ideal into the stage of actuality with one rapid whirl and rush, has been the second factor.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_154"><!-- --></a>Indeed the presence of three such personalities as Mr. Tilak, Mrs. Besant and Mr. Gandhi at the head and in the heart of the present movement, should itself be a sure guarantee of success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_155"><!-- --></a>The nation has accepted the near fulfilment of his great aim as its own political aim, the one object of its endeavour, its immediate ideal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_156"><!-- --></a>The Government of India and the British nation have accepted complete self-government as their final goal in Indian administration; a powerful party in England, the party which seems to command the future, has pronounced for its more speedy and total accomplishment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_157"><!-- --></a>A handful of dissentients there may be in the country who still see only petty gains in the present and the rest in the dim vista of the centuries, but with this insignificant exception, all the Indian provinces and communities have spoken with one voice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_158"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak’s principles </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 657</p>
<p class="PE"> of work have been accepted; the ideas which he had so much trouble to enforce have become the commonplaces and truisms of our political thought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_159"><!-- --></a>The only question that remains is the rapidity of a now inevitable evolution.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2552"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Among the great company of remarkable figures that will appear to the eye of posterity at the head of the Indian Renascence, one stands out by himself with peculiar and solitary distinctness, one unique in his type as he is unique in his work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is as if one were to walk for a long time amid a range of hills rising to a greater or lesser altitude, but all with sweeping contours, green-clad, flattering the eye even in their most bold and striking elevation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But amidst them all, one hill stands apart, piled up in sheer strength, a mass of bare and puissant granite, with verdure on its summit, a solitary pine jutting out into the blue, a great cascade of pure, vigorous and fertilising water gushing out from its strength as a very fountain of life and health to the valley.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Such is the impression created on my mind by Dayananda.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>And something of the very soul and temperament of that peculiar land entered into his spirit, something of Girnar and the rocks and hills, something of the voice and puissance of the sea that flings itself upon those coasts, something of that humanity which seems to be made of the virgin and unspoilt stuff of Nature, fair and robust in body, instinct with a fresh and primal vigour, crude in the crude<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1618" href="#">1</a>, but in a developed nature capable of becoming a great force of genial creation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2554"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>When I seek to give an account to myself of my sentiment and put into precise form the impression I have received, I find myself starting from two great salient characteristics of this man’s life and work which mark him off from his contemporaries and compeers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Other great Indians have helped to make India of today by a self-pouring into the psychological material </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 662</p>
<p class="PE"> of the race, a spiritual infusion of themselves into the fluent and indeterminate mass which will one day settle into consistency and appear as a great formal birth of Nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>They have entered in as a sort of leaven, a power of unformed stir and ferment out of which forms must result.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>One remembers them as great souls and great influences who live on in the soul of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>They are in us and we would not be what we are without them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But of no precise form can we say that this was what the man meant, still less that this form was the very body of that spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2555"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The example of Mahadev Govind Ranade presents itself to my mind as the very type of this peculiar action so necessary to a period of large and complex formation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>If a foreigner were to ask us what this Mahratta economist, reformer, patriot precisely did that we give him so high a place in our memory, we should find it a little difficult to answer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>We should have to point to those activities of a mass of men in which his soul and thought were present as a formless former of things, to the great figures of present-day Indian life who received the breath of his spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And in the end we should have to reply by a counter question, “What would Maharashtra of today have been without Mahadev Govind Ranade and what would India of today be without Maharashtra?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But even with those who were less amorphous and diffusive in their pressure on men and things, even with workers of a more distinct energy and action, I arrive fundamentally at the same impression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Vivekananda was a soul of puissance if ever there was one, a very lion among men, but the definite work he has left behind is quite incommensurate with our impression of his creative might and energy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>We perceive his influence still working gigantically, we know not well how, we know not well where, in something that is not yet formed, something leonine, grand, intuitive, upheaving that has entered the soul of India and we say, “Behold, Vivekananda still lives in the soul of his Mother and in the souls of her children.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>So it is with all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Not only are the men greater than their definite works, but their influence is so wide and formless that it has little relation to any formal work that they have left behind them.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2556"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Very different was the manner of working of Dayananda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 663</p>
<p class="PE"> Here was one who did not infuse himself informally into the indeterminate soul of things, but stamped his figure indelibly as in bronze on men and things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Here was one whose formal works are the very children of his spiritual body, children fair and robust and full of vitality, the image of their creator.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Here was one who knew definitely and clearly the work he was sent to do, chose his materials, determined his conditions with a sovereign clairvoyance of the spirit and executed his conception with the puissant mastery of the born worker.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>As I regard the figure of this formidable artisan in God’s workshop, images crowd on me which are all of battle and work and conquest and triumphant labour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Here, I say to myself, was a very soldier of Light, a warrior in God’s world, a sculptor of men and institutions, a bold and rugged victor of the difficulties which matter presents to spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And the whole sums itself up to me in a powerful impression of spiritual practicality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The combination of these two words, usually so divorced from each other in our conceptions, seems to me the very definition of Dayananda.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2557"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Even if we leave out of account the actual nature of the work he did, the mere fact that he did it in this spirit and to this effect would give him a unique place among our great founders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>He brings back an old Aryan element into the national character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>This element gives us the second of the differentiae I observe and it is the secret of the first.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>We others live in a stream of influences; we allow them to pour through us and mould us; there is something shaped and out of it a modicum of work results; the rest is spilt out again in a stream of influence.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Even when we would fain be militant and intransigent, we are really fluid and opportunist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Dayananda seized on all that entered into him, held it in himself, masterfully shaped it there into the form that he saw to be right and threw it out again into the forms that he saw to be right.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>That which strikes us in him as militant and aggressive, was a part of his strength of self-definition.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>And what an act of grandiose intellectual courage to lay hold upon this scripture defaced by ignorant comment and oblivion of its spirit, degraded by misunderstanding to the level of an ancient document of barbarism, and to perceive in it its real worth as a scripture which conceals in itself the deep and energetic spirit of the forefathers who made this country and nation, — a scripture of divine knowledge, divine worship, divine action.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The essential is that he seized justly on the Veda as India’s Rock of Ages and had the daring conception to build on what his penetrating glance perceived in it a whole education of youth, a whole manhood and a whole nation-hood.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2565"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Dayananda accepted the Veda as his rock of firm foundation, he took it for his guiding view of life, his rule of inner existence and his inspiration for external work, but he regarded it as even more, the word of eternal Truth on which man’s knowledge of God and his relations with the Divine Being and with his fellows can be rightly and securely founded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>This everlasting rock of the Veda, many assert, has no existence, there is nothing there but the commonest mud and sand; it is only a hymnal of primitive barbarians, only a rude worship of personified natural phenomena, or even less than that, a liturgy of ceremonial sacrifice, half religion, half magic, by which superstitious animal men of yore hoped to get themselves gold and food and cattle, slaughter pitilessly their enemies, protect themselves from disease, calamity and demoniac influences and enjoy the coarse pleasures of a material Paradise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>To that we must add a third view, the orthodox, or at least that which arises from Sayana’s commentary; this view admits, practically, the ignobler interpretation of the substance of Veda and yet — or is it therefore? — exalts this primitive farrago as a holy Scripture and a Book of Sacred Works.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2566"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Now this matter is no mere scholastic question, but has a living importance, not only for a just estimate of Dayananda’s work but for our consciousness of our past and for the determination of the influences that shall mould our future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>A nation grows into what it shall be by the force of that which it was in the past and is in the present, and in this growth there come periods of conscious and subconscious stock-taking when the national soul selects, modifies, rejects, keeps out of all that it had or is acquiring whatever it needs as substance and capital for its growth and action in the future: in such a period of stocktaking we are still and Dayananda was one of its great and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 668</p>
<p class="PE"> formative spirits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But among all the materials of our past the Veda is the most venerable and has been directly and indirectly the most potent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Even when its sense was no longer understood, even when its traditions were lost behind Pauranic forms, it was still held in honour, though without knowledge, as authoritative revelation and inspired Book of Knowledge, the source of all sanctions and standard of all truth.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2567"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>But there has always been this double and incompatible tradition about the Veda that it is a book of ritual and mythology and that it is a book of divine knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Brahmanas seized on the one tradition, the Upanishads on the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Later, the learned took the hymns for a book essentially of ritual and works, they went elsewhere for pure knowledge; but the instinct of the race bowed down before it with an obstinate inarticulate memory of a loftier tradition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>And when in our age the Veda was brought out of its obscure security behind the purdah of a reverential neglect, the same phenomenon reappears.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>While Western scholarship extending the hints of Sayana seemed to have classed it for ever as a ritual liturgy to Nature-Gods, the genius of the race looking through the eyes of Dayananda pierced behind the error of many centuries and received again the intuition of a timeless revelation and a divine truth given to humanity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>In any case, we have to make one choice or another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We can no longer securely enshrine the Veda wrapped up in the folds of an ignorant reverence or guarded by a pious self-deceit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Either the Veda is what Sayana says it is, and then we have to leave it behind for ever as the document of a mythology and ritual which have no longer any living truth or force for thinking minds, or it is what the European scholars say it is, and then we have to put it away among the relics of the past as an antique record of semi-barbarous worship; or else it is indeed Veda, a book of divine knowledge, and then it becomes of supreme importance to us to know and to hear its message.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2568"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is objected to the sense Dayananda gave to the Veda that it is no true sense but an arbitrary fabrication of imaginative learning and ingenuity, to his method that it is fantastic and unacceptable to the critical reason, to his teaching of a revealed </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 669</p>
<p class="PE"> Scripture that the very idea is a rejected superstition impossible for any enlightened mind to admit or to announce sincerely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>I will not now examine the solidity of Dayananda’s interpretation of Vedic texts, nor anticipate the verdict of the future on his commentary, nor discuss his theory of revelation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>I shall only state the broad principles underlying his thought about the Veda as they present themselves to me.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>For in the action and thought of a great soul or a great personality the vital thing to my mind is not the form he gave to it, but in his action the helpful power he put forth and in his thought the helpful truth he has added or, it may be, restored to the yet all too scanty stock of our human acquisition and divine potentiality.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2569"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>To start with the negation of his work by his critics, in whose mouth does it lie to accuse Dayananda’s dealings with the Veda of a fantastic or arbitrary ingenuity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Not in the mouth of those who accept Sayana’s traditional interpretation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>For if ever there was a monument of arbitrarily erudite ingenuity, of great learning divorced, as great learning too often is, from sound judgment and sure taste and a faithful critical and comparative observation, from direct seeing and often even from plainest common sense or of a constant fitting of the text into the Procrustean bed of preconceived theory, it is surely this commentary, otherwise so imposing, so useful as first crude material, so erudite and laborious, left to us by the Acharya Sayana.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Nor does the reproach lie in the mouth of those who take as final the recent labours of European scholarship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>For if ever there was a toil of interpretation in which the loosest rein has been given to an ingenious speculation, in which doubtful indications have been snatched at as certain proofs, in which the boldest conclusions have been insisted upon with the scantiest justification, the most enormous difficulties ignored and preconceived prejudice maintained in face of the clear and often admitted suggestions of the text, it is surely this labour, so eminently respectable otherwise for its industry, good will and power of research, performed through a long century by European Vedic scholarship.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE"> of the Vedic religion and the amount of support given to it by the intrinsic evidence of the Veda itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Here Dayananda’s view is quite clear, its foundation inexpugnable.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Immediately the whole character of the Veda is fixed in the sense Dayananda gave to it; the merely ritual, mythological, polytheistic interpretation of Sayana collapses, the merely meteorological and naturalistic European interpretation collapses.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>If the names of the godheads express qualities of the one Godhead and it is these which the Rishis adored and towards which they directed their aspiration, then there must inevitably be in the Veda a large part of psychology of the Divine Nature, psychology of the relations of man with God and a constant indication of the law governing man’s Godward conduct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Dayananda asserts the presence of such an ethical element, he finds in the Veda the law of life given by God to the human being.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> minimise it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>Western scholars minimise because they feel uneasy whenever ideas that are not primitive seem to insist on their presence in these primeval utterances; they do not hesitate openly to abandon in certain passages interpretations which they adopt in others and which are admittedly necessitated by their own philological and critical reasoning because, if admitted always, they would often involve deep and subtle psychological conceptions which <i>cannot</i> have occurred to primitive minds!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Sayana minimises because his theory of Vedic discipline was not ethical righteousness with a moral and spiritual result but mechanical performance of ritual with a material reward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>But, in spite of these efforts of suppression, the lofty ideas of the Veda<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1621" href="#">3</a> still reveal themselves in strange contrast to its alleged burden of fantastic naturalism or dull ritualism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The Vedic godheads are constantly hymned as Masters of Wisdom, Power, Purity, purifiers, healers of grief and evil, destroyers of sin and falsehood, warriors for the truth; constantly the Rishis pray to them for healing and purification, to be made seers of knowledge, possessors of the truth, to be upheld in the divine law, to be assisted and armed with strength, manhood and energy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Dayananda has brought this idea of the divine right and truth into the Veda; the Veda is as much and more a book of divine Law as Hebrew Bible or Zoroastrian Avesta.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2575"><!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The cosmic element is not less conspicuous in the Veda; the Rishis speak always of the worlds, the firm laws that govern them, the divine workings in the cosmos.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>But Dayananda goes farther; he affirms that the truths of modern physical science are discoverable in the hymns.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The ancient civilisations did possess secrets of science some of which modern knowledge has recovered, extended and made more rich and precise but others are even now not recovered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>There is then nothing fantastic in Dayananda’s idea that Veda contains truth of science as well as </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 673</p>
<p class="PE"> truth of religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>I will even add my own conviction that Veda contains other truths of a science the modern world does not at all possess, and in that case Dayananda has rather understated than overstated the depth and range of the Vedic wisdom.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2576"><!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Objection has also been made to the philological and etymological method by which he arrived at his results, especially in his dealings with the names of the godheads.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>But this objection, I feel certain, is an error due to our introduction of modern ideas about language into our study of this ancient tongue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>We moderns use words as counters without any memory or appreciation of their original sense; when we speak we think of the object spoken of, not at all of the expressive word which is to us a dead and brute thing, mere coin of verbal currency with no value of its own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>In early language the word was on the contrary a living thing with essential powers of signification; its root meanings were remembered because they were still in use, its wealth of force was vividly present to the mind of the speaker.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>We say “wolf” and think only of the animal, any other sound would have served our purpose as well, given the convention of its usage; the ancients said “tearer” and had that significance present to them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_68"><!-- --></a>We say “agni” and think of fire, the word is of no other use to us; to the ancients “agni” means other things besides and only because of one or more of its root meanings was applied to the physical object fire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_69"><!-- --></a>Our words are carefully limited to one or two senses, theirs were capable of a great number and it was quite easy for them, if they so chose, to use a word like Agni, Varuna or Vayu as a sound-index of a great number of connected and complex ideas, a key-word.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_70"><!-- --></a>It cannot be doubted that the Vedic Rishis did take advantage of this greater potentiality of their language, — note their dealings with such words as <span class="devan">gau</span> and <span class="devan">candra</span>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_71"><!-- --></a>The Nirukta bears evidence to this capacity and in the Brahmanas and Upanishads we find the memory of this free and symbolic use of words still subsisting.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2577"><!--SENT--><a name="s_72"><!-- --></a>Certainly, Dayananda had not the advantage that a comparative study of languages gives to the European scholar.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> have to use both sources of light for the elucidation of Veda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_74"><!-- --></a>Still this only affects matters of detail and does not touch the fundamental principles of Dayananda’s interpretation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_75"><!-- --></a>Interpretation in detail is a work of intelligence and scholarship and in matters of intelligent opinion and scholarship men seem likely to differ to the end of the chapter, but in all the basic principles, in those great and fundamental decisions where the eye of intuition has to aid the workings of the intellect, Dayananda stands justified by the substance of Veda itself, by logic and reason and by our growing knowledge of the past of mankind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_76"><!-- --></a>The Veda does hymn the one Deity of many names and powers; it does celebrate the divine Law and man’s aspiration to fulfil it; it does purport to give us the law of the cosmos.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>There was in this country an ancient and indigenous system of medicine, which had shared the fate of the other Hindu arts and sciences both in the comparatively high degree of scientific knowledge and intelligent practice it had reached in astonishingly early times and in the premature blight which had subsequently come over it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>In surgery, in pharmacy and in sanitation its knowledge was sound and masterly; it conducted successfully surgical operations which would have been far beyond contemporary science in Europe; it had amassed a pharmacopoeia from indigenous drugs, which, however imperfect, was possessed of considerable merit and efficacy; and its rules of sanitation were exhaustive, sound and in consonance with the scientific opinion of today.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Its theory of the human body was, it is true, rather in agreement with ancient opinion than the more enlightened modern ideas, but its practical science was superior to its theory.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Its practice became mechanical; its science fell into desuetude; the old authorities couched in the learned tongue came to be repeated by rote; its pharmacopoeia was administered<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1626" href="#">6</a> without intelligence or original research and analysis and therefore with only a fitful </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 688</p>
<p class="PE"> efficacy; surgical knowledge ceased to exist except in a rudimentary form, and sanitary rules once invested with a religious sanction came to be flagrantly violated in the daily practice of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Mahomedan medicine, a mediaeval science based on the Greek, did not tend to correct this state of things; it only added another imperfect system to the existing one.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>To a country thus circumstanced Western civilisation came with a medical science which, recovered from its old stagnation, was making immense strides, with a vastly superior pharmacy, an ever bolder and more subtle surgery and organised and living grasp of sanitation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But there is another and a larger aspect of the matter and that is that this economic problem is our last ordeal as a people.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2603"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Two years ago I stood looking at the wonders of that great Exhibition at Paris which summed up in so striking a manner the progress of a century in civilisation, industry and commerce.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>If I were asked what struck me most in that noble and artistic effort of a great nation, I should answer: the magnificent proportions and excellent management of the undertaking, so vast in conception and admirable in execution; the efficiency of the orderly and illuminating arrangement and careful accuracy of detail; and after that, the extraordinary ingenuity displayed in the educational section in methods and appliances; and not only the ingenuity but the thoroughness of these methods, especially </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 695</p>
<p class="PE"> in the exhibits of Germany and America.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But besides these two special exhibits, that which struck me most profoundly was the enormous difference between India and Europe to-day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Those vast halls crowded with shining steel work, the fruits of the combined industry and genius of a dozen nations; the amazing richness of texture and delicacy of design in the products of those machines; the vigorous life and aspiration which glowed in the Art, as well as the clear precision of the knowledge reflected in the Science; all this impressed me more than I can say.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2604"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But beyond all this triumph of Man over Nature and her powers, one fact struck me with a curious emphasis — the enormous gulf which separates the European and the native of India in their ideas of comfort.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>There rose up before me the interior of a typical Indian home, and as I contrasted it with the truly surprising inventions around me, all devoted to that one object, refinement, our much-boasted simplicity seemed bare and meagre beyond description.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>I contrasted those empty rooms — without even a chair or a table — with the luxury, the conveniences, which are the necessaries of a European cottage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>My mind went back to the bazaar in my own city of Baroda, the craftsmen working at their old isolated trades with the methods which have sufficed them for centuries without a change, the low irregular houses, the dreamy life drifting between them, and then contrasted it all with this keen and merciless tide which was sweeping and eddying around me, drawing its needs from a thousand machines like these and gathering its comforts from the four quarters of the globe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>And with the contrast I had a vivid sense of the enormous gulf which we have to bridge over before India can be said to be on the same plane as the European nations.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2605"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>And yet, I thought, there is a change coming over India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The appearance of our houses is being altered by the revolution which is being made in their furniture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is slow, for there are many who deplore it and speak of it in tones of regret as a process of denationalisation and a fall from simplicity to a burdensome and costly luxury.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But the change is rather in the direction in which the money is spent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Our fathers made up by opulence </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 696</p>
<p class="PE"> of material for the poverty of convenience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The futility of such regrets is shown by the fact that most of these eulogists of the past show in their own houses, even if only in a slight degree, the effects of the tendency which they deplore.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>I do not mean that we should dispense with simplicity; but let it be a wise moderation in the midst of plenty, not the fatalistic acceptance of poverty as a virtue in itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>And there can be no doubt that this tendency, which is now in its initial stage, will grow in strength with the course of years, until with the necessary differences due to climate and other environments it brings us approximately near to the Western mode of living.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2606"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But this mode is a rich and costly mode; to maintain it requires easy circumstances and a large diffusion of wealth.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The future, therefore, imperatively claims this from us, that we shall cease to be a purely agricultural country and vindicate for ourselves some place at least among commercial and manufacturing nations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Otherwise we shall only establish for ourselves the unhappiness of unsatisfied cravings and the benumbing effects of an ideal to which we can make no approach.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>To attempt to discourage them for political reasons or from social or religious conservatism is unjust and unwise and must eventually prove futile.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_288"><!-- --></a>And that is especially true of some Indian States which invest their surplus capital in Government securities, instead of using it in the development of the resources of their own territories.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2660"><!--SENT--><a name="s_289"><!-- --></a>This is not, however, our only fault.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_290"><!-- --></a>There is another fault which is nearly as fatal to any system of industry, and that is our lack of confidence in ourselves and in one another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_291"><!-- --></a>Without self-confidence you can never do anything; you will never found an industry or build up a trade, for you have nothing to carry you through the first anxious years when the only dividend is hope, and the best assets are unfaltering courage and faith in oneself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_292"><!-- --></a>And without confidence in one another you will never have a credit system, and without a credit system no modern commerce can exist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_293"><!-- --></a>It is this want of co-operation, this mutual distrust which paralyses Indian industry, ruins the statesman, and discredits the individual even in his own household.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_294"><!-- --></a>I believe that this trait of our character, though in some cases arising from our obvious defects and instances of actual misconduct among ourselves, is mainly due to the fact that the nation has long been split up into incoherent units, but also to the ignorance and restricted vision which result from our own exclusiveness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_295"><!-- --></a>We have denied ourselves the illuminating experience of foreign travel and are too prone to imagine that weaknesses are confined to India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_296"><!-- --></a>Failures and defalcations are as common in Europe as among ourselves; and yet we allow ourselves to be too easily discouraged by such incidents.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_297"><!-- --></a>Hence arises the habit of censorious judgment, a disposition to put the worst construction on the conduct of our friends and relatives, without trying to find the truth, which destroys all trust and tolerance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_298"><!-- --></a>Our view of the conduct of friends, of the policies of administrations, of the success and integrity of commercial undertakings, are all vitiated by a readiness to believe the worst.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 717</p>
<p class="PE"> suspend judgment and know the man and the motive before we criticise, that we shall be able to repose trust where trust is due.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_302"><!-- --></a>Let us remember that we must expect failures at first; but that it is those who learn from failure that succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_303"><!-- --></a>Moreover, as any one may learn from a survey of the present state of industry, there is evidence that some do succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_304"><!-- --></a>We have not, of course, made the most of our opportunities, but it is worth while remembering that something has been done because it shows us what it is possible to do, and encourages us to do it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_305"><!-- --></a>If any one wishes to know, in more detail, what has been done and what might be done, he could not do better than consult Mr Ranade’s excellent book on the subject.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2662"><!--SENT--><a name="s_306"><!-- --></a>And now let me say a word about this Exhibition and its aims.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_307"><!-- --></a>I take it that an Exhibition is intended to draw together the scattered threads of industrial activity, so that the members of any trade may learn not only what is the latest development in their own trade, but also what other trades are doing, and what in the other trades is likely to help them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_308"><!-- --></a>Then it is hoped that the spectacle of advance and improvement will arouse emulation and suggest new ideas and also draw industries together.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_309"><!-- --></a>But are the conditions in India such that we may hope for this?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_310"><!-- --></a>I fear not; I fear that the <i>ryot</i> will not yet come to learn from us and that there will be few craftsmen who will go away with new ideas and the memory of new processes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_311"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, we should not despair.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2663"><!--SENT--><a name="s_312"><!-- --></a>It should be remembered that a similar difficulty was experienced in England in connection with the Workmen’s Institutes which sprang up all over the country in response to Dr George Birkbeck’s suggestions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_313"><!-- --></a>The object was to provide the mechanic with lectures on his own trade; but the attempt at first largely failed from the incapacity of the working man to learn anything from the lectures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_314"><!-- --></a>Lectures and exhibitions bear fruit only when the people have received sufficient general education to make them mentally receptive and deft in adaptation and invention.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_315"><!-- --></a>When that goal is reached, such exhibitions may most usefully </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 718</p>
<p class="PE"> be turned into local museums, and if possible a syllabus of instruction attached to the exhibits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_316"><!-- --></a>On the other hand, there is yet another function which exhibitions perform and which is equally useful, and that is their influence as general education among the classes whose intelligence is already aroused, and who go away with a new sense of what there is to learn.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_317"><!-- --></a>Life is not yet all machinery which it takes an expert to understand, and there are many new ideas which the collection of the most recent efforts in Art and Science in one place can inspire, and especially is this true if there is the comparison of the old with the new.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2664"><!--SENT--><a name="s_318"><!-- --></a>But before any of these undertakings and enterprises, which I have mentioned, can succeed, India must be thoroughly awakened.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_320"><!-- --></a>It means action.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_326"><!-- --></a>The masses of India are lost in a hopeless ignorance, and that is why they are so intensely conservative and lacking in confidence and initiative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_327"><!-- --></a>We cling to old customs because we do not know that they are not essential to our religion, and we dare not adopt new ideas or establish new industries because we do not know how to set about it.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Causes of decline</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2679"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>1. Trade throughout the Raj is in a state of depression and decline.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The great industries that once flourished, such as weaving, dyeing, sharafi etc. are entirely broken and though a number of small retail trades have sprung up, the balance is greatly on the side of decline.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The main causes of this condition of things are<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2680"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>I European competition and that of such towns as Ahmedabad, Poona etc.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2683"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>IV The continual drain of money from the State effected by<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2684"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>(1) Immense purchases from Europe, Bombay etc,<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2687">and other similar causes.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Necessary measures</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2688"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>2. To combat these evils there are certain general measures which are essential, as without them local industry must continue to be handicapped and consequently continue to decline.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->State custom for local work</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2689"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>3. Wherever such goods are produced locally as for their combined excellence and cheapness may properly be used by the Government, these should be preferred in State purchases to all others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The transference of Government custom from good local manufactures where such exist is especially undesirable and ought to be avoided.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Where better work begins to be </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 726</p>
<p class="PE"> produced outside, the local artisans ought with proper encouragement from the Revenue authorities to be able to make up the deficiency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But such improvement is impossible if Government instantly withdraws its custom.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Improvement of local production</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2690"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>4. The State should make inquiries on a large scale for<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2691"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>(<i>a</i>) means of improving local production to the European standard;<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2692"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>(<i>b</i>) means of improving country hand-machines.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2693"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Weaving, for instance, was once a great and famous industry in every division of the Raj.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>A Committee should be appointed to find out in each place where the most excellent hand-woven cloths used to be made, the real causes of decline and to discover and apply measures by which they may compete successfully with European cloths.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This would not be so difficult a matter as it appears at least with regard to several woven and dyed cloths.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>These are inferior to European in appearance and fineness but superior in strength and durability.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It ought not to be impossible to supply the missing qualities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Much may be done by experiments under sub-head (<i>b</i>), and such are very necessary as European machinery is too costly to be introduced on the scale required.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Similarly with regard to dyeing attempts should be made to discover pucca country dyes and improve such as are already in use.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Means of encouraging industrial expansion</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2694"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>5. Besides this the State should push forward the same object by<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2695"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>(<i>a</i>) help and inducements.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Tasalmat<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2698"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>6. The help may come in the shape of tasalmat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>This should especially be given where enterprising traders have started work of an European quality and need help to bring the enterprise to perfection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But for the objects of the Government to succeed, it is necessary that tasalmat should not be given in the present haphazard fashion, but after careful inquiry and stringent tests and with due and constant supervision.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Machinery</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2699"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>7. Help may also be given in the shape of machinery, which should be given at cost price to workers in articles which can be produced more cheaply here than abroad.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>These workers should receive grants on condition of using the machinery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>There are instances in which deshi artisans have succeeded in reproducing English machinery, after one or two mistakes, at a much cheaper rate than the English.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Implements and patterns</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2700"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>8. Often only polish is required, or better implements, to bring country goods up to the proper standard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>In these cases Government might give the workers specimens and patterns of English work as there are in many places artisans skilful enough to reproduce work they have once examined, and should help them in procuring the necessary tools.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Inducements</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2701"><!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>9. Those who first manufacture locally from material which is at present exported raw should have their work made easy for them in the matter of taxes etc., and clever artisans settling from outside should have building timber etc., cheap or gratis.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2702"><!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>10. Inducement should be held out to<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2703"><!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>(<i>a</i>) those who bring up country goods to the European Standard;<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 728</p>
<p class="PE">This inducement should take the shape of grants (bucksheesh, inams) or of a poshak given in durbar.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->State Patronage</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2706"><!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>11. The State should patronize all country commodities thus improved to an European standard in preference to European commodities, as also new industries, that is to say, manufactures made from material now exported in a raw state.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2707"><!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Lists should be prepared from each khata of the articles in use there and over against each item, details should be entered as to whether, how far, and where they are prepared in the State, along with the price, quality and other necessary particulars.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>With these lists as a basis, there should be a stringent rule enforced on all departments that wherever country goods equal or even a little inferior to European can be had, European goods should be eschewed in their favour.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2708"><!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Artisans who can work up to the European level, besides receiving costly Inams, should be favoured with the State custom, half the price being advanced as tasalmat.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Means of spreading knowledge</h1>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Resolving a Problem of Seniority in the High School</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2830"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>College Office<br/> Baroda 3rd. May 05.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2831"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Mr. Nag was appointed in the Baroda High School by His Highness the Maharaja Sahib but being on leave has not yet joined his appointment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>I believe that His Highness the Maharaja Sahib while reserving to himself the full right to make appointments on other weighty grounds, is always willing to give the utmost consideration to the claims of seniority of old and deserving servants.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Moreover the position and prospects of Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Nag if he is to enter the Educational Service permanently need clearer definition.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2832"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>In forwarding this application,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1646" href="#">1</a> therefore, I take the opportunity to state fully my opinion on the matter.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2833"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The course suggested by the teachers to meet the difficulties of the case is of course quite impracticable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Mr. Nag is a graduate of the Cambridge University and has spent many years in Europe at great expense in order to acquire higher qualifications and a wider culture and experience, and to expect that he would be willing or ought to be asked to serve on Rs 65 in the last place of a Bombay graduate in this Department and with the prospects of a teacher of the second grade in the High School is to lose all sense of proportion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The precedent of Mr. Manishanker Bhat does not apply to such a case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Nag has accepted Rs 150 the lowest pay at present possible to a man of his qualifications with corresponding prospects and it is not possible to cut him down now from Rs 150 to Rs 65 with practically no prospects at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 746</p>
<p class="PE"> Even apart from this the expedient of turning part of the regular salary into personal pay is one which in my opinion ought not to be too freely used, as it tends to turn transference from one Department to another into an unmerited punishment.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2834"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>On the other hand there are strong grounds for the rest of the representation; the work of the High School staff has been admirable and judged by examination results compares well with any other school in the Bombay Presidency, while the prospects are very poor and limited, and the introduction of a well paid outsider stops promotion far more effectually than can be the case in larger and more highly paid Departments.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2835"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Under these circumstances I suggest as the course which will as far as possible meet both sides of the question that Mr. Nag may be employed in the High School in a special grade like the Head Master and Mr. Dorabji Patel, and the rise in grade opened up by the appointment of Mr. Chunilal may be granted to Mr. Naravane although he will continue to work in the sixth standard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>This would introduce the least disturbance in the chances of the High School staff and at the same time make it more convenient for His Highness to utilise Mr. Nag’s services in any way in future either in this Department or elsewhere without any disturbance to the regular grades of the English Schools.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2846"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>I have gone very carefully through the scheme of the proposed examination for teachers and beg to give expression to the following opinions, which have been formed after very long and careful consideration.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2847"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>2. I do not quite see the object of introducing this severe and stringent examination into our State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Our schools are working quite well enough on the whole for the purposes of education </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 748</p>
<p class="PE"> as given in this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>I do not myself think very highly either of the principles or methods or results of that education but, being subject to the Bombay University, we have to take things as they are and cannot attempt anything ideal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Whatever defects still exist are inseparable from the low pay and qualifications required in the lower rank of teachers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In certain respects they may be modified by a mild test; but the sort of examination here proposed is such as might be prescribed in an European country where the science and art of education are really advanced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Here it is likely to degenerate into a formality harassing to the teachers but useless to the State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We simply have not got sufficient foothold from which to make a leap like this.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Undoubtedly the teachers will cram up the subjects learning by rote as is the habit in this country and a percentage of them will pass, but there it will end; a few of the brighter and smarter young men may understand and make the attempt to apply the principles they learn, but that will be all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If the University with its new constitution succeeds in giving a better basis for culture, then after a few years we might see what can be done; or we may watch the results of our training College and gradually apply an adequate test.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2848"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>3. If it is thought necessary to have a departmental examination now I should suggest the following alterations.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2849"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Rule 8. Whatever examination is held, should be formal and conducted by more than one person.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>This rule, making the promotion or dismissal of State servants depend on an informal oral examination by the Minister of Education, seems [to] me contrary to the principles which should govern these tests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The test under such circumstances might very easily be applied with great haste, injustice or partiality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The fact that the present Minister of Education is above suspicion in these respects does not guarantee the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The opinion of a Committee of 3 members would alone ensure a reasonable security to the teachers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>I would suggest that at least one of them should be a Professor of the College.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 749</p>
<p class="PE"><!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2850"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Rule 9. 50 per cent is too high a percentage in a test of this kind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>33 per cent, the University standard, should be adopted, especially if removal is to be the penalty of failure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2851"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Rule 10. This rule is Draconically harsh.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Removal ought on no account to be made the penalty of a Departmental Examination; the ordinary principle that the passing of the Examination will count in promotion is quite sufficient.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2852"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>4. As to the subjects of the examination, I would make it a far slighter affair than this up-to-date American machine would be.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2854"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Part II. Instead of this elaborate affair, it will be enough to see whether the teacher can make the boys understand the lesson, explain a subject correctly and command their attention.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">On a Head Assistant for the High School</h1>
<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Concise History</h2>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->History in short</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2861"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Baroda High School has for some time been increasing in numbers, until now it has reached the very large number of 750.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is high time therefore that in view of this immense increase, which renders the discipline of the School unmanageable by a single man, however active or able, some better arrangement should be made for the proper management of the School.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>A Head Master has to attend not only to the scholastic efficiency but to discipline and, so far as is possible under the conditions of Indian School life, to the life of the boys outside school-hours, especially to the physical education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The first object is fulfilled well enough under present circumstances, the second with but moderate success, the third hardly at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The scholastic efficiency of the School is on the whole admirable and the present Head Master and his staff deserve every credit for it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There are certain inconveniences resulting from the large number of classes which have to be maintained but at present these can be met.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Difficulty of the Head Master Baroda High School</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2862"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>2 Mr. G. M. Hasabnis wishes that an additional Teacher should be appointed, as he finds great difficulty in arranging for the classes when several teachers happen to be ill or on leave at one time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The undersigned acknowledges the difficulty but he is inclined to think it has been more acutely felt this year owing to exceptional circumstances and would like to wait for some time and see whether it is so or not, before making any proposal.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a></h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 752</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The circumstances which make discipline burdensome to maintain<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2863"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>3 The discipline of the School is maintained as well as possible under the circumstances, but marked signs are not wanting that the task has become too much for any single man to cope with.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The circumstances which have brought about this state of things are as follows: —<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2864"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>(1) The very large increase in the number of students from 400 when Mr. Hasabnis took charge to 750 now.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2865"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>(2) The consequent increase in the number of classes for each standard; formerly no standard had more than two divisions; now each standard has five classes with three very large Matriculation Classes.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2866"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>(3) The increase of the Drawing, Writing, Gymnasium and second language classes.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2867"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>(4) The addition of new buildings for the accommodation of the increased number.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2868"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>(5) The office work has much increased.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2869"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>(6) The teaching work of certain classes takes up much of the Head Master’s time and the area over which the classes are spread is large; merely going round for inspection, surprise visits and general supervision takes up a great deal of his time.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2870"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>(7) The work of new admissions every fortnight is heavy; then the various examinations are a great tax on the Head Master’s energy.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Importance of physical education</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2871"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>4 To see to the proper efficiency and progress of the physical education is under the circumstances a task beyond his energies; yet this is a side of Education the importance of which is being more and more recognised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The High School has much way to make up in this respect.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The views of the Ag. Principal<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2872"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>5 The one fully effective remedy would be to increase the High School staff by the appointment of an Assistant Head Master.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This would relieve the Head Master of much of his teaching work and give him both leisure and efficient assistance in the two other matters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This would not be an excessive allowance for so large a school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>In the Elphinstone High School which is smaller in size two Head Assistants are, I believe, allowed.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Converting one of the Matriculation Teachers’ posts into one of a Head Assistant</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2873"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>6 Having consideration however to the many calls on the State and the financial position, I am content to make a very modest proposal, viz. that one of the Matriculation Class Teachers’ posts the maximum salary of which is Rs 125/- should be converted into a post of Head Assistant, salary rising from Rs 160/- to Rs 200/- in 8 years.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The duties of the incumbent will be, in addition to his teaching work, to help the Head Master in maintaining the discipline of the School and give special attention to promoting the physical side etc.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>This appointment will not disturb matters in any way and will probably not really add to the expense of the School, as the slight excess will soon be made up by the increasing number of students.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In any case the arrangement seems to the undersigned imperatively necessary.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Mr. Dorabji M. Patel recommended to the post</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2874"><!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>7 Should the proposal be sanctioned, I propose for the post Mr. Dorabji M. Patel, Head Master Amreli High School (whose present salary is Rs 150/-) who adds conspicuous ability and intelligence to his long and meritorious service and is likely to carry weight with both teachers and students.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Points for decision</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2875"><!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>(1) Whether it is necessary to convert one of the Matriculation Class Teachers’ posts, the maximum salary of which is Rs 125/- into Head Assistant’s post — salary </p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Premises of Astrology</h1>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Chapter I. Elements</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2888"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Astrology depends on three things, the position of the planets in the heavens and with regard to each other, the condition of the planets at the natal hour or at the moment of enquiry, and the general character or tout ensemble of the horoscope.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Any error or deficiency with regard to any of these three elements separately or with regard to their mutual relations will affect the work of the astrologer and vitiate its correctness or its completeness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>To cast a horoscope completely is one of the most difficult operations known to Science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The astrologer is born, not made.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is as impossible to manufacture a perfect astrologer by education as to manufacture a poet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Hence the disrepute into which the profession of astrology too lightly and numerously followed has fallen in the Kaliyuga.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>In addition nine tenths<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1647" href="#">1</a> of the true science are lost and the little that remains, is replete with errors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Astrologers make lucky hits or stumble on the truth, but it is only a rare genius here and there who can predict correctly and even he is never safe against error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>For even when his intuition divines correctly, his authorities mislead him.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2889"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The position of the planets in the heavens is determined by the sign of the zodiac through which they are passing, their relation to the ascendant sign, their precise position in the sign reckoned by degrees and minutes; their relative position to each other by the distance of their signs from each other.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2890"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The condition of the planets is determined by the sign they are in according to which they are either elevated, fallen, ascending or descending, or possibly at home<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1648" href="#">2</a>; by the direction of their motion at the time, forward or backward; by the quality of their motion, swift, slow or normal; by their mutual relations of friendship, enmity or neutrality, — conjunction<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1649" href="#">3</a>, aspect, opposition or distance; by their nearness to the sun, setting or rising, divergent or convergent; by their location in a sign — friendly, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 758</p>
<p class="PE"> neutral or hostile, fixed or moving, male or female, fiery, watery, aery, earthy or ethereal; by their relations with gentle, fierce or inconstant planets.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2891"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The character of the horoscope is determined by the number of elevated, fallen, ascending, descending or entrenched, progressive or retrograde, rapid, sluggish or moderate, well housed or ill housed, setting, rising<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1650" href="#">4</a>, convergent or divergent planets; by the number<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1651" href="#">5</a> and nature of the planetary relations, conjunctions, aspects, oppositions, by the character of the ascendant, its lord and its tenants<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1652" href="#">6</a>, combinations, distributions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>All these circumstances have to be considered in order to determine whether the horoscope is great, mediocre or petty, favourable or malign, strong or weak.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The results have to be judged according to the character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The same details in a great<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1653" href="#">7</a> horoscope will mean something very different from what they would<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1654" href="#">8</a> mean in one that is petty or malign or even merely strong.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Moreover even if all the positions are the same, yet the infinitesimal shifting of a planet or a change in its character will often mean the difference between life and death, success or failure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>This is the reason why twins sometimes have different destinies, one dying, another living, or pursue an identical course up to a certain point, then diverge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>One hears astrologers say when the minute of birth is approximately stated, that is good enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It is the speech of incompetence or ignorance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The first necessity is to determine the exact minute or second of birth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>All the general results may be potentially true, yet owing to some accident depending on a few seconds’ difference, none of them<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1655" href="#">9</a> may have the occasion to come to pass.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But if the exact details are obtainable, there is no chance of that comparatively rare, but nevertheless well-instanced<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1656" href="#">10</a> fortuity.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2892"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The signs of the Zodiac are twelve in number, beginning from the Ram, in which the Sun reaches its elevation, and arching back to it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The sixth sign is usually called the Virgin in Europe, but the word gives an idea of purity which is not the character of the sign and is therefore inappropriate.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2896"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The names of the signs have nothing to do with their character in any of these kinds, but are determined by the spiritual “totem”, that is, the nervous type of the souls born in the signs.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Bk">(1890 — 1910)</h1>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Note on the Texts</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2912"><b>Early Cultural Writings</b> consists of essays on literature, education and art, as well as dialogues, biographical and historical sketches, and other short prose pieces. Most were written between 1890 and 1910, a few between 1910 and 1920. A little more than half the pieces (comprising about three-fifths of the bulk) were published during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime; the rest of the pieces have been transcribed from his manuscripts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2913">The contents of the volume are arranged by topic in nine parts. Two appendixes, consisting mostly of material not written for publication, come at the end.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Part One: The Harmony of Virtue (Cambridge 1890 – 1892)</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2914">Sri Aurobindo wrote all these pieces while an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge, between 1890 and 1892. He did not publish any of them during his lifetime.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2915"><b>The Sole Motive of Man’s Existence</b>. 1891. Editorial title. 
Published in <i>Sri Aurobindo. Archives and Research</i>, 1977, No 1-2 under the 
title <i>A Dialogue</i>. Found in Sri Aurobindo’s earliest surviving manuscript 
notebook, this fragment seems to have been written by him at Cambridge in 1891, 
that is, about a year before he began work on <i>The Harmony of Virtue</i>, the 
dialogue inspired by Plato (and Oscar Wilde) to which this one is related in 
form and theme. Several versions of the piece exist. There is an occasional 
inconsistency as regards the characters' names. The editors have given all names 
exactly as they appear in Sri Aurobindo's manuscript. The piece obviously is 
incomplete. Sri Aurobindo left alternatives to several passages. These are 
reproduced in the Reference Volume and in footnotes of this e-publication.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2916"><b>The Harmony of Virtue</b>. Dated “May 1892” towards the middle of the manuscript. The entire piece was probably written during 1892, Sri Aurobindo’s second and last year at Cambridge. He was referring to <i>The Harmony of Virtue</i> when he wrote late in his life: “It is true that under his [Plato’s] impress I rashly started writing at the age of 18 [<i>more likely 19</i>] an explanation of the cosmos on the foundation of the principle of Beauty and Harmony, but I never got beyond the first three or four chapters.” The name of the principal character, “Keshav Ganesh Desai”, recalls that of Keshav Ganesh Deshpande, one of Sri Aurobindo’s friends at Cambridge and subsequently in India.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Part Two: On Literature (Baroda 1893 – 1906)</h1>
<h2 class="sub-hd">Bankim Chandra Chatterji</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2919">This series of essays was published in seven instalments in as many issues of the <i>Indu Prakash</i>, a weekly Marathi–English newspaper of Bombay: 16 July 1894, 23 July 1894, 30 July 1894, 6 August 1894, 13 August 1894, 20 August 1894, 27 August 1894. The pieces were not signed: the phrase “By a Bengali” was printed above the texts and the word “Zero” at the end in place of a signature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2920">In 1950, when the series was rediscovered and shown to Sri Aurobindo, he wrote:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2921">I have not intended to republish these articles as they were written when I had just recently come from England and they contain some very raw matter such as the remarks about Indian art which I no longer hold.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2922">He added that it might be necessary for him “to revise and possibly to omit or alter some passages” before publication. He did not find time for this revision, and when the essays were published as a book in 1954, the <i>Indu Prakash</i> text was reproduced as it stood. The same text is reproduced here.</p>
<h2 class="sub-hd">On Poetry and Literature</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2923">Sri Aurobindo wrote these pieces on literary subjects between 1898 and 1906 (or somewhat later). He did not publish any of them during his lifetime.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2924"><b>Poetry</b>. Circa 1898 – 1901. Editorial title. This piece was written in the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 767</p>
<p class="PE"> same notebook as the lecture on Augustan poetry (see the next note).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2925"><b>Characteristics of Augustan Poetry</b>. In the manuscript, “First Lecture” is written above the title. This piece and the following one were written by Sri Aurobindo while he was working as a professor of English literature at Baroda College between 1898 and 1901. The authors and periods covered by the two lectures were those assigned by the Bombay University for the “voluntary” section of the English B.A. examination in 1898 and 1899. Sri Aurobindo wrote additional passages for this lecture on blank pages of the manuscript. These passages have been printed as footnotes. A long passage that seems to expand ideas presented in the third paragraph of the lecture is published separately under the title “Poetry” (see above).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2926"><b>Sketch of the Progress of Poetry from Thomson to Wordsworth</b>. See the note to the previous piece for dating information. Additional passages are treated as in that piece.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2927"><b>Appendix: Test Questions</b>. Sri Aurobindo evidently wrote these questions to prepare his students for the university examination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2928"><b>Marginalia on Madhusudan Dutt’s <i>Virangana Kavya</i></b>. Circa 1894 – 1900. Editorial title. These two pieces were written by Sri Aurobindo in his copy of the Bengali poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt’s <i>Virangana Kavya</i> (Calcutta: Vidyaratan Press, 1885). The first was written above the text of Epistle One, the second above the title of Epistle Two. The line of Sanskrit is from the Bhagavad Gita (2.16) and may be translated as follows: “that which is not, cannot come into existence; that which is, cannot go out of existence”.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2929"><b>Originality in National Literatures</b>. Circa 1906 – 8. Editorial title. This piece, unlike the others in this section, may have been written by Sri Aurobindo after his departure from Baroda in March 1906.</p>
<h2 class="sub-hd">The Poetry of Kalidasa</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2930">Sri Aurobindo wrote the material published in this section between 1898 and 1903. All but one of the pieces were meant for inclusion in a planned book-length study, the contents of which he sketched out in “A Proposed Work on Kalidasa” (see below). He used four notebooks for writing the material that was to make up this book, apparently working on two or more pieces concurrently. On the first page of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 768</p>
<p class="PE"> one of the notebooks he wrote the title “The Poetry of Kalidasa”; the editors have used this as the title of the section. Sri Aurobindo brought only two of the pieces to a satisfactory conclusion. One of them, “The Age of Kalidasa”, was revised and published in <i>The Indian Review</i> (Madras) in 1902. The other, “The Seasons”, was revised and published in Sri Aurobindo’s own weekly review, the <i>Karmayogin</i>, in 1909. The other pieces were left in varying states of completeness in the manuscript notebooks. In reproducing them here, the editors have followed the order of “A Proposed Work”. Certain passages that could not be included in the final texts have been published in an appendix at the end of the section.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2931"><b>A Proposed Work on Kalidasa</b>. Circa 1898 – 1903. Editorial title.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2933"><b>The Age of Kalidasa</b>. Circa 1898 – 1902. See Chapter II of “A Proposed Work”.

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2941">Sri Aurobindo wrote these essays and notes on the Mahabharata around 1902. He did not publish any of them during his lifetime.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2942"><b>Notes on the Mahabharata</b>. Circa 1902. Sri Aurobindo wrote this essay shortly after September 1901, when the “recent article” mentioned in the first paragraph, Velandai Gopala Aiyer’s “The Date of the Mahabharata War”, was published in <i>The Indian Review</i> of Madras. The text of Sri Aurobindo’s essay consists of: (1) an elaborate title page with “proposita”; (2) an introductory passage headed “Vyasa; some Characteristics”; (3) a longer passage mostly on the same subject beginning “Vyasa is the most masculine of writers”; (4) a long passage beginning “It was hinted in a recent article in the Indian Review”, dealing, among other things, with the political story of the Mahabharata; and (5) a short incomplete passage headed “Mahabharata”, concerned mainly with linguistic matters. Passages (1) to (4) were written in that order in one notebook; passage (5) was written independently in another notebook around the same time. (Note that in passage (5) Sri Aurobindo wrote that the date given by Aiyer in the <i>The Indian Review</i> was “known beyond reasonable doubt”, indicating that this passage, like passages (1) to (4), was written after September 1901.) It is clear from indications in the manuscript that (4) was intended to replace (2) as the opening of the essay. Most of (2) was to be incorporated in (4), which was to be followed by (3). The present text of the essay has been printed in accordance with these guidelines. Since some interesting paragraphs of (2) were not marked for inclusion in the recast essay, all of (2) has been reproduced after the main text (4 and 3). The independent piece (5) has been placed at the end, while the title page (1) remains at the beginning.</p>

This series of essays was published in the <i>Karmayogin</i> in eight instalments between 12 February and 2 April 1910. Sri Aurobindo left Calcutta for Chandernagore in the middle of February 1910, at which time he broke off his connection with the journal (see the note to Part Six for details). He evidently left the manuscript of <i>A System of National Education</i> behind, and eight chapters of the work were published in the <i>Karmayogin</i> by his associate Sister Nivedita (Margaret Noble), whom he had asked to look after the journal in his absence. The eighth chapter was published in the journal’s last issue. Other chapters, if they were written, have been lost. The eight essays were published as a booklet in 1921 by Tagore and Co., Madras. This apparently was a pirated edition; in 1924 the “only authorised edition” was published by the Arya Publishing House, Calcutta. In this edition, Sri Aurobindo added the subtitle “Some Introductory Essays” as well as the publisher’s note that is reproduced here on page 381. The book was reprinted by the same publisher in 1944, 1948 and 1953, and by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1970. In 1948 the subtitle was changed to “Some Preliminary Ideas”.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Part Six: The Chandernagore Manuscript (1910)</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2964">The pieces that make up this section form the bulk of a 51-page handwritten manuscript originally consisting of three gatherings of foolscap paper numbered by Sri Aurobindo I: 1 – 16, II: 1 – 17 and III: 1 – 18. Each of the gatherings appears to be matter for one issue of a journal. Each begins with an essay entitled “Passing Thoughts” and contains an instalment of “Conversations of the Dead”, an instalment of “Epistles from Abroad”, one or more essays, including those entitled “Historical Impressions”, one or more other pieces, including those entitled “In /At the Society’s Chambers”, and a blank-verse poem. Several facts suggest that the journal these pieces were intended for was the <i>Karmayogin</i>. “Passing Thoughts” was the heading of the <i>Karmayogin’s</i> opening column of opinion in the issues of 12 and 19 February 1910. After being warned that he was about to be arrested for sedition, Sri Aurobindo departed from Calcutta for Chandernagore sometime towards the end of February 1910, and remained there incognito for about six weeks before voyaging to Pondicherry. Several sheets of the 51-page manuscript bear notations in another hand indicating that it was sent from somewhere to Calcutta and then returned. In addition, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 775</p>
<p class="PE"> all of Sri Aurobindo’s signatures on the manuscript were cut out or obliterated, a necessary precaution if it was in transit at a time when Sri Aurobindo was wanted by the police. Finally, a number of pieces that had been copied out from the manuscript were published in <i>The Standard Bearer</i>, a journal brought out from Chandernagore, in the 1920s. On the basis of this evidence, it would be natural to assume that Sri Aurobindo wrote the manuscript while in Chandernagore in February and March 1910 with the intention of having the pieces published in the <i>Karmayogin</i>, that the manuscript was sent from Chandernagore to Calcutta but returned without being published, and that some pieces were copied out from it in Chandernagore at that time and later published in <i>The Standard Bearer</i>. Against all this, however, stands a statement made by Sri Aurobindo in 1944 that his “active connection with the two newspapers [the <i>Karmayogin</i> and the <i>Dharma</i>] ceased” from the moment of his departure for Chandernagore (<i>On Himself</i> [1972], p. 57). Taken by itself, this statement would seem to rule out the possibility that Sri Aurobindo wrote the manuscript in Chandernagore for use in the <i>Karmayogin</i>. It is possible that he wrote the manuscript in Calcutta before his departure for Chandernagore, took it with him and sent it back from there to Calcutta. But it is also possible, and perhaps more likely, that he wrote the manuscript during his stay in Chandernagore and subsequently forgot about it, as he forgot about several other of his early writings.</p>

<p class="PE"><b>A Great Mind, a Great Will</b>. This obituary notice was written at the request of Bipin Chandra Pal, editor of the newspaper <i>The Independent</i>, in which it was published on 5 August 1920. (Tilak died on 1 August of that year.) The piece was not included in editions of <i>Bankim — Tilak — Dayananda</i> published during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime, perhaps because the text was not available when the book was put together in 1940. The present text has been compared with the text published in <i>The Independent</i> as well as with a draft found among Sri Aurobindo’s manuscripts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2995"><b>Dayananda: The Man and His Work</b>. This piece was first published in <i>The Vedic Magazine</i>, Lahore, in 1915. It or the next piece or both were subsequently included in at least five pamphlets between 1921 and 1939. Both articles were included in <i>Bankim — Tilak — Dayananda</i> in 1940 and subsequently.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2996"><b>Dayananda and the Veda</b>. This article was first published in <i>The Vedic Magazine</i> in 1916. See the note to the previous item for reprints.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2997"><b>The Men that Pass</b>. This obituary article on Romesh Chandra Dutt was published in the <i>Karmayogin</i> on 4 December 1909, and included in <i>Bankim — Tilak — Dayananda</i> in 1940 and subsequently. In the 1940 edition it was originally to be placed after the article on Bankim Chandra. Asked “why Romesh Dutt should come after Bankim”, Sri Aurobindo replied, ironically, “I don’t know. I don’t know why he should be there at all.” Later, when correcting the proofs, he indicated that the Dutt piece should come at the end of the book.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Appendix One: Speeches and Reports (Baroda 1901 – 1905)</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2998">Sri Aurobindo wrote the documents reproduced in this section while working as an administrative officer and professor in the erstwhile Princely State of Baroda. Then known as Arvind or Aravind or Aurobind Ghose, Sri Aurobindo began work in the state in February 1893, just after his return from England, and continued until February 1906, when he left to join the Swadeshi Movement in Bengal. During the first part of this thirteen-year period he was employed as a trainee in various administrative departments. From 1897 to 1901 he worked as a professor of English and of French in the Baroda College. There </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 780</p>
<p class="PE"> followed a period of three years, 1901 – 4, when he served in a secretarial capacity under Sayajirao Gaekwar, the Maharaja of Baroda. (In many of the documents the Maharaja is referred to as “the Gaekwar”.) Finally, in 1905 and 1906, he returned to the College as vice-principal and professor. The documents reproduced in this Appendix are a selection from those that still exist, which are themselves perhaps only a fraction of the written work he produced while employed in Baroda. A selection from the letters he wrote at this time is included in <i>On Himself</i>.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Speeches Written for the Maharaja of Baroda (1901 – 1902)</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 2999">Between 1901 and 1904, Sri Aurobindo was sometimes asked to write speeches for the Maharaja of Baroda. The first piece reproduced here is a draft from one of Sri Aurobindo’s notebooks for a speech that does not seem to have been delivered by the Maharaja. The second piece is a speech actually delivered by the Maharaja that is known to have been written by Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3000"><b>Medical Department</b>. Circa 1901. This piece, written by Sri Aurobindo in one of his own notebooks, clearly was intended to be a speech (or possibly a written report) presented by the Maharaja of Baroda. (“The year of my accession” [p. 689] refers to the year the Maharaja assumed the throne, 1881.) The Maharaja did give a speech entitled “Medicine and Health of the Community in India” on 29 March 1901, but this does not bear any resemblance to <i>Medical Department</i>. It is possible that Sri Aurobindo’s draft was rejected in favour of another’s.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3001"><b>The Revival of Industry in India</b>. This speech was delivered by the Maharaja of Baroda on 15 December 1902, at the opening of the Industrial Exhibition held in Ahmedabad in conjunction with the 1902 session of the Indian National Congress. It certainly was written by Sri Aurobindo. He identified it as his composition in 1940, when one of his disciples commented: “a speech he [the Maharaja] made at the Industrial Exhibition was marvellous”. After ascertaining that it was the Ahmedabad exhibition that was meant, Sri Aurobindo drew a chorus of laughter by remarking, “That was the speech I prepared for him.” (Talk of 12 December 1940, published in Nirodbaran, <i>Talks <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> with Sri Aurobindo</i> [2001], vol. 2, p. 952.) The text is reproduced from <i>Speeches and Addresses of His Highness Sayaji Rao III, Maharaja of Baroda</i>. Volume One, 1877 – 1910 (Cambridge: Privately Printed at the University Press, 1927), pp. 83 – 117.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3002"><b>Report on Trade in the Baroda State (1902)</b>. Editorial title. These “General Suggestions” form the first part of a 72-page report on trade in the state of Baroda that was printed in 1902. Although unsigned, the report almost certainly was the work of Sri Aurobindo (see references below). He seems to have compiled the report from data contained in a four-volume manuscript report written in Gujarati or Marathi, the languages of the Baroda State. In summarising this material, he used his own language and enough of his own thought for the portion reproduced here to be considered his own work. The second part, dealing with “Local Suggestions” at three times the length of the first part, is not reproduced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3003">Three contemporary documents mention Sri Aurobindo (Arvind Ghose) as the author of what is called variously a “printed report”, an “English book in short” and “Mr. Ghose’s compilation”. All three apparently refer to the report reproduced here. The documents, all in the “Arvind Ghose collection” (AGC) of the Central Record Office, Baroda, are (1) letter Manubhai to Dewan 23 June 1902 (AGC file 5, pp. 141 – 42); (2) Huzur Mulki Department, General Branch File No. 214/F. N. 29 (AGC file 17, which also contains the copy of the report used as our text); (3) Huzur Mulki Department R. No. 111.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3004"><b>Resolving a Problem of Seniority in the High School</b>. 3 May 1905. This opinion was written by Sri Aurobindo as acting principal of Baroda College in response to a representation of certain teachers in the Baroda High School (which was administered by the College) setting forth their objections to a proposal to give a new, highly qualified teacher a post that would normally have gone to one of them.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Appendix Two: Premises of Astrology (c. 1910)</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3007">These notes, found in a notebook used by Sri Aurobindo around 1910, seem to have been written more as an <i>aide memoire</i> than as an original contribution to the study of astrology. After the three complete chapters, Sri Aurobindo wrote the title of a fourth, “The Hours”, but did not continue. The title of the second chapter, “The Signs”, is editorial.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Printing History</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3008">A little more than half the pieces in the present volume were published in one form or another during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime. The following pieces first appeared in periodicals or, in one case, a book: <i>Bankim Chandra Chatterji</i>, “The Age of Kalidasa”, “The Seasons”, “Address at the Baroda College Social Gathering”, <i>The Brain of India</i>, <i>A System of National Education</i>, <i>A Preface on National Education</i>, <i>The National Value of Art</i>, “Two Pictures”, “Indian Art and an Old Classic”, “The Revival of Indian Art”, “Dinshah, Perizade”, “Turiu, Uriu”, all the contents of the Chandernagore Manuscript, all the reviews making up Part Eight, and all the contents of Part Nine. See the above notes for details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3009">Several of these pieces were subsequently reprinted in the form of books during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime. The two essays on Kalidasa were printed as two separate booklets by Tagore and Co., Madras, around 1921. In 1929, they were published together under the title <i>Kalidasa</i> by the Arya Sahitya Bhawan, Calcutta. Sri Aurobindo saw the proofs and made some revisions. The book was reprinted by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1950 and subsequently. In 1954 the Ashram brought out a posthumous collection of some of the unpublished writings on Kalidasa under the title <i>Kalidasa: Second Series</i>. <i>The Brain <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> of India</i> was published by the Prabartak Publishing House, Chandernagore, in 1921 and 1923, by the Arya Publishing House, Calcutta, in 1944 and 1948, and by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1955 and subsequently. <i>A System of National Education</i> was published by Tagore and Co., Madras, in 1921, by the Arya Publishing House in 1924, 1944, 1948 and 1953, and by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1970. The <i>National Value of Art</i> was published by the Prabartak Publishing House in 1922, by the Arya Publishing House in 1936 and 1946, and by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1953 and subsequently. The second to sixth reviews in Part Eight were included in <i>Views and Reviews</i>, published by the Sri Aurobindo Library, Madras, in 1941. Sri Aurobindo saw the proofs of this book and made some revisions. It was reprinted in 1946 by the same publishers. Subsequent editions were published by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. The contents of Part Nine were published under the title <i>Bankim — Tilak — Dayananda</i> by the Arya Publishing House in 1940 and 1947, and by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1955 and subsequently. Sri Aurobindo saw the proofs of the 1940 edition and made some revisions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Early Cultural Writings - 3010"><i>Bankim Chandra Chatterji</i> was first published in book-form by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1954. Some of the material on the Mahabharata was first published in book-form in <i>Vyasa and Valmiki</i> by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1956 and 1964. In 1989 all the material on the Mahabharata, augmented and reorganised, was published in volume 13 of <i>Sri Aurobindo: Archives and Research</i>.
