<h1><em>Publisher's Note</em></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 10">The Mother's commentaries on Sri Aurobindo's <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em> were given over the twelve-year period from 1958 to 1970. The commentaries may be divided into four periods according to date, character and form.</p><blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 11">1. Aphorisms 1–12 (1958). Oral replies to questions submitted beforehand in writing by the students, teachers and sadhaks of the Ashram during the Mother's Wednesday classes at the Ashram Playground.
            </p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 12">2. Aphorisms 13–68 (1960–61). Replies, mostly written, a few oral, to questions written to the Mother by a young instructor of the Ashram's physical education department.
            </p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 13">3. Aphorisms 69–124 (1962–66). Oral replies to a disciple. During this period the Mother digressed more and more from direct commentary on the aphorisms and used the occasions to explain the experiences she was having at the time.
            </p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 14">
                  4. Aphorisms 125–541 (1969–70). Brief written replies to questions asked by the instructor mentioned above.
            </p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 15">All the Mother's commentaries were spoken or written in French. She also translated Sri Aurobindo's text into French. Her translations of and commentaries on the first twelve aphorisms were published in 1959 under the title <em>Pensées et Aphorismes: Traduits et Commentes par La Mère</em>. The remaining translations and commentaries were serialised in French and English in the quarterly <em>Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education</em> between April 1960 and August 1976. A complete edition of the French text, entitled <em>Pensées et Aphorismes: Traduits et Commentes par La Mère</em>, was published in two tomes in 1974 and 1976. The first complete edition in English appeared in 1977 as Volume Ten of the Collected Works of the Mother. The present edition is a reprint of this volume with a few minor corrections.
            </p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 16">Sri Aurobindo's <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em> was written around 1913 during the early part of his stay in Pondicherry. Never revised or published during his lifetime, the aphorisms were first brought out in 1958 under the three headings established by the author: Jnana (Knowledge), Karma (Works) and Bhakti (Devotion).
            </p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 17">When the original manuscript of <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em> was examined preparatory to the publication of a new edition of the English text in 1977, several erroneous readings were found in the text of the first edition; this was the edition used by the Mother in making her translation and commentaries. These errors, mostly minor, have been corrected in this volume. A note has been given wherever the corrected reading is not in line with the Mother's comment.

<p class="P" id="aphorism-1" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 20" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">1 – There are two allied powers in man: knowledge and Wisdom. Knowledge is so much of the truth, seen in a distorted medium, as the mind arrives at by groping; Wisdom what the eye of divine vision sees in the spirit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 21">Someone has asked me, “Why are the powers allied?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 22">I suppose that we are so used to seeing all the elements in man quarrelling among themselves that the idea of their being “allied” causes astonishment. But these quarrels are only apparent. All the powers which come from the higher regions are in fact necessarily allied — they are united, they have agreed to fight the Ignorance. And Sri Aurobindo says clearly enough — for those who understand — that one of these powers belongs to the mind and that the other belongs to the Spirit. This is precisely the profound truth that Sri Aurobindo wants to reveal in his aphorism: if the mind tries to obtain the second power, it is unable to do so, since it is a power that belongs to the Spirit and arises in the human being together with the spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 23">Knowledge is something that the mind can obtain through much effort, although this is not the true knowledge, but only a mental aspect of knowledge; whereas Wisdom does not at all belong to the mind, which is altogether incapable of obtaining it, because, in fact, it doesn’t even know what it is. I repeat, Wisdom is essentially a power of the Spirit and it can arise only with the spiritual consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 24">It would have been interesting to ask what Sri Aurobindo</p>
<span id="page_3"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 3</p>
<p class="PE">means when he speaks of “the truth seen in a distorted medium”. First of all, what is this “distorted medium”, and what does the truth become in a “distorted medium”?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 25">As always, what Sri Aurobindo says can have several levels of meaning — one is more specific, the other more general. In the most specific sense, the distorted medium is the mental medium which works in ignorance and which is therefore unable to express truth in its purity. But since life as a whole is lived in ignorance, the distorted medium is also the earth-atmosphere which, in its entirety, distorts the truth seeking to express itself through it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 26">And here lies the most subtle point of this aphorism. What can the mind arrive at by groping? We know that it is always groping, seeking to know, erring, returning upon its previous attempts and trying again... Its progress is very, very halting. But what can it grasp of the truth? Is it a fragment, a piece, something which is still the truth, but only partially, incompletely, or is it something which is no longer the truth? That is the interesting point.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 27">We are used to being told — perhaps we have also repeated many times — that one can only have partial, incomplete, fragmentary knowledge which therefore cannot be true knowledge. This point of view is rather trite: one need only to have studied a little in life to be aware of it. However, what Sri Aurobindo means by “the truth seen in a distorted medium” is far more interesting than that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 28">Truth itself takes on another aspect; in this medium it is no longer the truth, but a distortion of the truth. Consequently, what can be seized of it is not a fragment which would be true, but an aspect, the false appearance of a truth which has itself melted away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 29">I am going to give you an image to try to make myself understood; it is nothing more than an image, do not take it literally.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 30">If we compare the essential truth to a sphere of immaculate,</p>
<span id="page_4"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 4</p>
<p class="PE">dazzling white light, we can say that in the mental medium, in the mental atmosphere, this integral white light is transformed into thousands and thousands of shades, each of which has its own distinct colour, because they are all separated from one another. The medium distorts the white light and makes it appear as innumerable different colours: red, green, yellow, blue, etc., which are sometimes very discordant. And the mind seizes, not a little fragment of the white light of the white sphere, but a larger or smaller number of little lights of various colours, with which it cannot even reconstitute the white light. Therefore it cannot reach the truth. It does not possess fragments of truth, but a truth that is broken up. It is a state of decomposition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 31">The truth is a whole and everything is necessary. The distorted medium through which you see, the mental atmosphere, is unsuited for the manifestation or the expression or even the perception of all the elements — and one can say that the better part is lost. So it can no longer be called the truth, but rather something which in essence is true, and yet no longer so at all in the mental atmosphere — it is an ignorance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 32">So, to summarise, I shall say that knowledge, as it can be grasped by the human mind, is necessarily knowledge in ignorance, one could almost say an ignorant knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 33">Wisdom is the vision of truth in its essence and of its application in the manifestation.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>12 September 1958</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" id="aphorism-2" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 34" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">2 – Inspiration is a slender river of brightness leaping from a vast and eternal knowledge; it exceeds reason more perfectly than reason exceeds the knowledge of the senses.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 35">A certain number of the questions you have asked are alike: “Why did Sri Aurobindo say it like this?” — one thing or another.</p>
<span id="page_5"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 5</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 36">I could reply, “He said it like this because he saw it like this.” But, to begin with, one thing should be understood; these are definitions given by Sri Aurobindo, definitions which he gives mostly in a paradoxical form to compel us to think.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 37">There are dictionary definitions, which are the ordinary explanations of words as they are commonly understood. These do not make you think. What Sri Aurobindo says, however, is said in order to break up the usual conception, to bring you in touch with a deeper truth. In this way a whole lot of questions are eliminated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 38">The effort one must make is to try to find the deeper knowledge, the deeper truth that Sri Aurobindo has expressed in this way, which is not the usual way of defining a word.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 39">I shall select some questions: the first one, which interested me because it comes from a thoughtful person, concerns the word “knowledge” and compares the way Sri Aurobindo has used the word in this aphorism with the way he used it in the aphorism we read last week.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 40">When, in last week’s aphorism, Sri Aurobindo opposed — as one might say — “knowledge” to “Wisdom”, he was speaking of knowledge as it is lived in the average human consciousness, the knowledge which is obtained through effort and mental development, whereas here, on the contrary, the knowledge he speaks of is the essential Knowledge, the supramental divine Knowledge, Knowledge by identity. And this is why he describes it here as “vast and eternal”, which clearly indicates that it is not human knowledge as we normally understand it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 41">Many people have asked why Sri Aurobindo said that the river is “slender”. This is an expressive image which creates a striking contrast between the immensity of the divine, supramental Knowledge — the origin of this inspiration, which is infinite — and what a human mind can perceive of it and receive from it. Even when you are in contact with these domains, the portion, so to say, which you perceive, is minimal, slender. It is like a tiny little stream or a few falling drops and these drops are so pure,</p>
<span id="page_6"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 6</p>
<p class="PE">so brilliant, so complete in themselves, that they give you the sense of a marvellous inspiration, the impression that you have reached infinite domains and risen very high above the ordinary human condition. And yet this is nothing in comparison with what is still to be perceived.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 42">I have also been asked if the psychic being or psychic consciousness is the medium through which the inspiration is perceived.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 43">Generally, yes. The first contact you have with higher regions is a psychic one. Certainly, before an inner psychic opening is achieved, it is difficult to have these inspirations. It can happen as an exception and under exceptional conditions as a grace, but the true contact comes through the psychic; because the psychic consciousness is certainly the medium with the greatest affinity with the divine Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 44">Later, when one has emerged from the mental consciousness into a higher consciousness beyond the mind, beyond even the higher mind, and when one opens oneself to the Overmind regions, and through the Overmind to the Supermind, one can receive inspirations directly. And naturally at that point they become more frequent, richer, if one may say so, more complete. There comes a time when inspiration can be obtained at will, but this obviously demands considerable inner development.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 45">As we have just said, this inspiration from regions far above the mind surpasses in value and quality the highest achievements of the mind, such as reason. Reason is certainly at the apex of human mental activity. It can review and control the knowledge acquired with the help of the senses. It has often been said that the senses are altogether defective instruments of knowledge, that they are incapable of perceiving things as they are, that the information they supply is superficial and very often faulty. When it is fully developed, the human reason knows this and does not trust the knowledge of the senses. It is only if one is infrarational, if I may say so, that one believes that all one sees, hears, or touches is absolutely true. As soon as one is developed</p>
<span id="page_7"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 7</p>
<p class="PE">in the region of higher reason, one knows that all these notions are almost essentially false, and that one can in no way rely on them. But the knowledge one receives from this supramental or divine region surpasses all that can be conceived or understood by reason, at least to the same extent that reason surpasses the knowledge of the senses.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 46">Several questions concern a practical point: “How to develop the capacity for inspiration?”; “What are the conditions needed to receive inspiration and is it possible to have it constantly?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 47">I have already replied to this. When one opens oneself to the supramental regions, one puts oneself in the right state for receiving constant inspirations. Until then, the best method is to silence the mind as much as possible, to turn it upwards and to remain in a state of silent and attentive receptivity. The more one is able to establish a silent, perfect calm in the mind, the more one becomes capable of receiving inspirations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 48">It was also asked whether inspirations are of different qualities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 49">In their origin, no. They always come down from the regions of pure Knowledge and penetrate whatever part of the human being is most receptive, best adapted to receive them — but these inspirations may apply to different domains of action. They can be inspirations of pure knowledge, they can also be inspirations that contribute to one’s effort to progress, and they can also be inspirations for action which help in the practical and outer realisation. But the question here is the use one makes of the inspiration, rather than of the quality of the inspiration — the inspiration is always like a drop of light and truth which succeeds in penetrating the human consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 50">What the human consciousness does with this drop depends on the attitude, the need, the occasion, the circumstances; it does not alter the essential nature of the inspiration but it does alter the use one makes of it, its practical application.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 51">Some of the other questions concern the difference between</p>
<span id="page_8"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8</p>
<p class="PE">inspiration and intuition. They are not the same thing; but I think that we will have the opportunity of returning to this subject in the course of our reading. When Sri Aurobindo tells us what he considers intuition to be, we shall come back to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 52">In a general and almost absolute way, if you truly wish to profit from these readings, as from all of Sri Aurobindo’s writings, the best method is this: having gathered your consciousness and focused your attention on what you are reading, you must establish a minimum of mental tranquillity — the best thing would be to obtain perfect silence — and achieve a state of immobility of the mind, immobility of the brain, I might say, so that the attention becomes as still and immobile as a mirror, like the surface of absolutely still water. Then what one has read passes through the surface and penetrates deep into the being where it is received with a minimum of distortion. Afterwards — sometimes long afterwards — it wells up again from the depths and manifests in the brain with its full power of comprehension, not as knowledge acquired from outside, but as a light one carried within.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 53">In this way the faculty of understanding is at its highest, whereas if, while you read, the mind remains agitated and tries to understand at once what it is reading, you lose more than three-quarters of the force, the knowledge and the truth contained in the words. And if you are able to refrain from asking questions until this process of absorption and inner awakening is completed, well, then you will find that you have far fewer questions to ask because you will have a better understanding of what you have read.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>19 September 1958</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" id="aphorism-3" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 54" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">3 - When I speak, the reason says, “This will I say”; but God takes the word out of my mouth and the lips say something else at which reason trembles.</p>
<span id="page_9"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 9</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 55">When Sri Aurobindo says “I”, he speaks of himself and of his own experience. We would like to be able to say that what he says is symbolic and that it could apply to many people, but unfortunately this is not so at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 56">This experience, of not saying what you had meant to say when you speak, but something else, is very common; but it is the opposite of what Sri Aurobindo speaks of here. That is to say, when you are sitting calmly at home using your reason to its full extent, you decide to say this or that, that this is the reasonable thing, but all too often, when you begin to speak, it is the lower impulses, the unreasonable emotions and the vital reactions which take hold of the tongue and make you say things which you should not say.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 57">Here it is the same phenomenon, but, as I said, the other way round. Instead of infrarational impulses which make you speak with excitement and passion, it is, on the contrary, an inspiration coming from above, a light and a knowledge greater than those of the reason which take hold of the tongue and make you say things that you would have been incapable of saying even with the most enlightened reason.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 58">Sri Aurobindo tells us that “the reason trembles” because these higher truths always appear in the human domain as paradoxes, revelations contrary to reason; not because reason is incapable of understanding what comes from the higher regions, but because these revelations are always ahead of, very much ahead of, that which reason has understood or accepted. What the human reason of today finds reasonable has been paradoxical and mad in the past; and probably — one may say, certainly — these unexpected, paradoxical, revolutionary revelations which are manifesting now and making the reason tremble, will in time to come be very reasonable knowledge, which in turn will tremble before new revelations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 59">It is this sense of something which is always moving, progressing, being transformed, that Sri Aurobindo is trying to give us with these compact phrases which for a time shake</p>
<span id="page_10"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="PE">our understanding of things. It is to push us forward, to give us the sense of the complete relativity of all that manifests in the world, and of this universe which is always in motion, ever moving towards a higher and greater Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 60">For us, right now, the supramental transformation is the expression of the highest truth, it is the revolution we must bring about on earth; and certainly this revolution must be felt as an absolute by the majority of human beings, otherwise they will not be able to bring it about. But Sri Aurobindo insists that we should not forget that this absolute is still relative and that any manifestation must always be relative with regard to an Absolute which is even more absolute — the Unmanifest that will manifest later.</p>

Why should one care to remember — why try to retain that knowledge? On the day or at the moment that it is needed one will have it again.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 70">What Sri Aurobindo has written, the words ["caught a glimpse"] which have been translated<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="12-2" href="#">2</a> as <em>entrevoyaient</em>, means to see something in its totality, but for a very brief moment. It is obvious that a constant vision of all these wonders would automatically compel you to set out on the path. It is also certain that a little fragmentary glimpse is not enough—it would not have enough weight to compel you to follow the path.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 71">But if you had a total vision, however brief, you would not be able to resist the temptation of making the effort needed to realise it. But, in fact, the total vision is exceptional, and that is why Sri Aurobindo says to us: “If mankind only...”</p>

And this is so stupid, because, in the final analysis, the destiny of each individual is the same: you are born, you live — more or less satisfactorily — and you die; then you wait for a certain length of time, and again you are born, you live — more or less satisfactorily — and again you die, and so on indefinitely, until you feel you have had enough of it.</p>

<p class="PE">when you say, “Come what may! After all, there’s not much to lose”, then you become wary, you wonder if it is reasonable, if it is true, if all that is not an illusion, if you are not just imagining things, if there is really any substance to it.... And mind you, this mistrust seems stupid, but you encounter it even in the most intelligent, even in those who have repeatedly had conclusive experiences — it is something that you take in with the food you eat, the air you breathe, your contacts with others; and that is why you can speak of the “tentacles of Nature”,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="13-3" href="#">3</a> everywhere, in all things, like an octopus stealing in and catching you and binding you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 76">Even when you have overcome these two obstacles, when the experiences are so strong that you can no longer doubt, that doubt becomes impossible — like doubting one’s own life — then there remains something awful, petty, dry, corrosive: scepticism. And this is founded on human pride, that is why it lasts so long. You want to think that you are above all these things, “Oh, I am not one to fall into those traps! I am a reasonable man, I see things from a practical point of view; I’m not so easily deceived.” It is awful!... It is sordid. But it is dangerous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 77">Even in moments of greatest enthusiasm, even when one is filled with an exceptional, marvellous experience — it rises from the lowest depths. It is ugly, slimy, disgusting. And yet it rises, and spoils everything.</p>

And these enlightened cranks, who want to get there at once, as soon as possible, who thirst for truth, light, beauty, balance — they bother her, they urge her on, they tell her that she is wasting her time. Her time! She always replies, “But I have all eternity before me. Am I in a hurry? Why are you in such a hurry?” And again, with a smile: “Your haste is all too human; widen yourselves, become infinite, be eternal, and you will no longer be in a hurry.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 81">This is what happens when one sees things from a great height, from a great distance, when one’s view is vast, almost infinite. Everything that upsets human beings and makes them suffer, disappears; so those who are very wise, who have abandoned life for the sake of higher wisdom tell you with a smile, “Why suffer? Come out of it and you will suffer no more.” That is all very well individually but, in fact, if you think about others you may wish this rather tragic comedy would come to an end sooner. And it is very justifiable to feel tired of living like a beast at pasture, of roaming from one patch of grass to another, of ruminating in a corner, of having such narrow horizons and of missing all the splendours of life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 82">Perhaps it amuses Nature that we should be like that, but we are tired of it, we want to be different.</p>

When you have truly had enough of it and want things to be different, then you have the courage, the strength, the capacity to conquer these three terrible enemies: fear, doubt and scepticism. But I repeat, it is not enough to sit down one fine day, watch yourself be, and struggle with these things inside you once and for all. You have to do it and do it again and again and continue in a way which seems almost endless, to be sure that you have got rid of it all. In</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 84">As for the marvels Sri Aurobindo tells us about, it is better not to describe them, because each individual feels them, undergoes them, experiences them in his own way — and for each person that is the best way.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 88">Once again I must repeat that the form of these aphorisms is purposely paradoxical in order to give the mind a little shock and awaken it enough for it to make an effort to understand. One must not take this aphorism literally. Some people seem worried by the idea that reason must disappear for one to become wise. It is not that, it is not that at all.</p>

<p class="PE">fancies, one’s more or less disordered emotional imaginings, and one is in danger of being very far removed not merely from wisdom but even from the knowledge needed for conducting oneself acceptably. But when one has managed to control all the lower parts of the being with the help of reason, which is the apex of ordinary human intelligence, then if one wants to go beyond this point, if one wants to liberate oneself from ordinary life, from ordinary thought, from the ordinary vision of things, one must, if I may say so, stand upon the head of reason, not trampling it down disdainfully, but using it as a stepping stone to something higher, something beyond it, to attain to something which concerns itself very little with the decrees of reason; something which can allow itself to be irrational because it is a higher irrationality, with a higher light; something which is beyond ordinary knowledge and which receives its inspirations from above, from high above, from the divine Wisdom.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 91">That is what this means.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 92">As for the knowledge of which Sri Aurobindo speaks here, it is ordinary knowledge, it is not Knowledge by identity; it is knowledge that can be acquired by the intellect through thought, through ordinary means.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 93">But once again — and in any case we shall have occasion to return to this when we study the next aphorism — do not be in a hurry to abandon reason in the conviction that you will immediately attain to Wisdom, because you must be ready for Wisdom; otherwise, by abandoning reason, you run a great risk of falling into unreason, which is rather dangerous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 94">Many times in his writings, particularly in <em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>, Sri Aurobindo warns us against the imaginings of those who believe they can do sadhana without rigorous self-control and who heed all sorts of inspirations, which lead them to a dangerous imbalance where all their repressed, hidden, secret desires come out into the open under the pretence of liberation from ordinary conventions and ordinary reason.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 95">One can be free only by soaring to the heights, high above human passions. Only when one has achieved a higher, selfless freedom and done away with all desires and impulses does one have the right to be free.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 97">One who would break the law must be above the law. One who would ignore conventions must be above conventions. One who would despise all rules must be above all rules. And the motive of this liberation should never be a personal, egoistic one: the desire to satisfy an ambition, aggrandise one’s personality, through a feeling of superiority, out of contempt for others, to set oneself above the herd and regard it with condescension. Be on your guard when you feel yourself superior and look down on others ironically, as if to say, “I’m no longer made of such stuff.” That’s when you go off the track and are in danger of falling into an abyss.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 98">When one truly attains wisdom, the true wisdom, the wisdom Sri Aurobindo is speaking of here, there is no longer higher and lower; there is only a play of forces in which each thing has its place and its importance. And if there is a hierarchy it is a hierarchy of surrender to the Supreme. It is not a hierarchy of superiority with regard to what is below.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 99">And with human understanding, human reason, human knowledge, one is unable to discern this hierarchy. Only the awakened soul can recognise another awakened soul, and then the sense of superiority disappears completely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 100">True wisdom comes only when the ego disappears, and the ego disappears only when you are ready to abandon yourself completely to the supreme Lord without any personal motive and without any expectation of profit — when you do it because you cannot do otherwise.</p>

Wisdom looks behind the veil and sees. Reason divides, fixes details and contrasts them; Wisdom unifies, marries contrasts in a single harmony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 102">All that Sri Aurobindo writes about knowledge, reason, Wisdom is said in order to bring us out of the rut of conventional thinking, and, if possible, make us perceive the reality behind the appearances.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 103">As a general rule, with a few very rare exceptions, men are content to observe more or less accurately everything that happens around them, and sometimes within themselves, and to classify all these observations according to one superficial system of logic or another. And they call this organisation, these systems, “knowledge”. It has never occurred to them, they have not even begun to perceive that all the things they see, touch, feel, experience, are false appearances and not reality itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 104">The constant, general argument is, “But I see it, I touch it, I feel it — consequently it is true.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 105">They should, on the contrary, tell themselves, “I see it, I touch it, I feel it — consequently it is false.” We are at opposite poles and there is no way of coming to an understanding.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 106">For Sri Aurobindo, true knowledge is precisely Knowledge by identity, and wisdom is the state one achieves when one is in this true knowledge. He says it here: Wisdom looks behind the veil of false appearances and sees the reality behind it. And Sri Aurobindo emphasises that when one defines something with the superficial, outer knowledge, it is always in opposition to something else; it is always by means of a contrast that one explains what one sees, feels, touches — and does not understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 107">Reason always sets one thing against another and compels you to make a choice. People whose thought and reason are clear see all the differences between things. It is rather remarkable that reason can only work through differences; it is because one perceives the difference between this and that, one act and</p>
<span id="page_19"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 19</p>
<p class="PE">another, one object and another, that one makes decisions and that reason works.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 108">But it is precisely true Knowledge, Knowledge by identity and the wisdom which results from it that always see the point where all apparently contradictory things harmonise, complement each other, form a perfectly coherent, coordinated whole. And naturally that changes entirely the point of view, the perception, and the consequences in action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 109">The first absolutely indispensable step is not to repeat, more or less mechanically and without quite knowing what you are saying, that “appearances are false”. You say it because Sri Aurobindo has told us so — but without really understanding it. And yet, when you want to understand something, you continue to look, to observe, to touch, to taste and to feel, because you believe there are no other means of observation. It is only when you have had the experience of the “reversal of consciousness”, when you have gone behind these things, when you can feel, experience, in the most concrete manner, their illusory appearance, that you are able to understand. But, unless you have had the experience, you can read all the aphorisms, repeat and learn them, have faith in them and still not perceive: they have no reality for you. All these appearances remain the only way of coming into contact with the outer world and of becoming aware of what it is. And sometimes you can spend a whole lifetime learning how things are in their appearances and be considered very cultured, very intelligent, highly knowledgeable, when you have observed all this in detail and remembered all that you have observed or learnt...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 110">Strictly speaking, you can, when you have worked hard, have some slight effect on these appearances, change them a little — this is how, through science, you learn to manipulate matter — but there is no true change and there is no true power. And when you are in that state, you are wholly convinced that there is nothing you can do to change your character. You feel trapped in a kind of fatalism that weighs you down, you know</p>
<span id="page_20"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 20</p>
<p class="PE">neither whence nor how; you are born like this, in such and such a place, into such and such an environment, with such and such a character, and you get through life as best you can, adapting to things without having much influence on them, and trying to mitigate the drawbacks of your own character without having the power to transform it. You feel caught in a net, you are the slave of something of which you are unaware. You are the plaything of circumstances, of unknown forces, of a will you do not submit to, but which constrains you. Even the most rebellious are slaves, because the only thing that liberates you is precisely the act of passing behind the veil and discovering what lies beyond it. Once you have seen, you know who you are and once you have established your true identity, you have the key to the true transformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 111">We read, we try to understand, we explain, we try to know. But a single minute of true experience teaches us more than millions of words and hundreds of explanations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 112">So the first question is: “How to have the experience?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 113">To go within yourself, that is the first step.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 114">And then, once you have succeeded in going within yourself deeply enough to feel the reality of that which is within, to widen yourself progressively, systematically, to become as vast as the universe and lose the sense of limitation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 115">These are the first two preparatory movements.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 116">And these two things must be done in the greatest possible calm, peace and tranquillity. This peace, this tranquillity brings about silence in the mind and stillness in the vital.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 117">This effort, this attempt must be renewed very regularly, persistently. And after a certain lapse of time, which may be longer or shorter, you begin to perceive a reality that is different from the reality perceived in the ordinary, external consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 118">Naturally, by the action of Grace, the veil may suddenly be rent from within, and at once you can enter the true truth; but even when that happens, in order to obtain the full value and full effect of the experience, you must maintain yourself in a</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 120">The dogmas of sects and the intolerance of religions come from the fact that the sects and religions consider their beliefs alone to be knowledge, and the beliefs of others to be error, ignorance or charlatanism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 121">This simple movement causes them to set up what they believe to be true as dogma and to violently condemn what others believe to be true. To think that your knowledge is the only true one, that your belief is the only true one and that others’ beliefs are not true, is to do precisely what is done by all sects and religions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 122">So, if you are doing exactly the same thing as the sects and religions, you have no right to mock them. You do the same thing without being aware of it because it seems quite natural to you. What Sri Aurobindo wants to make you understand is that when you say, “We are in possession of the truth and what is not this truth is an error” — though you may not dare say it in such a crude way — you are doing exactly the same thing as all the religions and all the sects.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 123">If you objectify a little you will see that you have spontaneously, without realising it, established as knowledge everything you have learnt, everything you have thought, everything which has given you the impression of being particularly true and of major importance; and you are quite ready to contradict any different notion held by those who say, “No, no, it is like this, it is not like that.”</p>
<span id="page_22"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 124">If you watch yourself in action, you will understand the mechanism of this intolerance and you will immediately be able to put an end to all these useless discussions. This brings us back to what I have already told you once: the contact which you have had with the truth of things, your personal contact—a contact which is more or less clear, profound, vast, pure—may have given <em>you</em>, as an individual, an interesting, perhaps even a decisive experience; but although this contact may have given you an experience of decisive importance, you must not imagine that it is a universal experience and that the same contact would give others the same experience. And if you understand this, that it is something purely personal, individual, subjective, that it is not at all an absolute and general law, then you can no longer despise the knowledge of others, nor seek to impose your own point of view and experience upon them. This understanding obviates all mental quarrels, which are always totally useless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 125">Obviously, the first part of the aphorism can be taken as advice, but this is not what Sri Aurobindo meant when he wrote it; he wanted to make us conscious of the error we make ourselves but ridicule in others. This is a habit with us, not only in this particular case, but in all cases. It is rather remarkable that when we have a weakness — for example a ridiculous habit, a defect or an imperfection — since it is more or less part of our nature, we consider it to be very natural, it does not shock us. But as soon as we see this same weakness, this same imperfection, this same ridiculous habit in someone else, it seems quite shocking to us and we say, “What! He’s like that?” — without noticing that we ourselves are “like that”. And so to the weakness and imperfection we add the absurdity of not even noticing them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 126">There is a lesson to be drawn from this. When something in a person seems to you completely unacceptable or ridiculous — “What! He is like that, he behaves like that, he says things like that, he does things like that” — you should say to yourself, “Well, well, but perhaps I do the same thing without being aware of it. I would do better to look into myself first before criticising</p>
<span id="page_23"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="PE">him, so as to make sure that I am not doing the very same thing in a slightly different way.” If you have the good sense and intelligence to do this each time you are shocked by another person’s behaviour, you will realise that in life your relations with others are like a mirror which is presented to you so that you can see more easily and clearly the weaknesses you carry within you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 127">In a general and almost absolute way anything that shocks you in other people is the very thing you carry in yourself in a more or less veiled, more or less hidden form, though perhaps in a slightly different guise which allows you to delude yourself. And what in yourself seems inoffensive enough, becomes monstrous as soon as you see it in others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 128">Try to experience this; it will greatly help you to change yourselves. At the same time it will bring a sunny tolerance to your relationships with others, the goodwill which comes from understanding, and it will very often put an end to these completely useless quarrels.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 129">One can live without quarrelling. It seems strange to say this because as things are, it would seem, on the contrary, that life is made for quarrelling in the sense that the main occupation of people who are together is to quarrel, overtly or covertly. You do not always come to words, you do not always come to blows — fortunately — but you are in a state of perpetual irritation within because you do not find around you the perfection that you would yourself wish to realise, and which you find rather difficult to realise — but you find it entirely natural that others should realise it.</p>

If you are conscious of it, well then, begin with the work which is given to <em>you</em>, that is to say, realise what you have to do and do not concern yourself with what others do, because, after all, it is not your business. And the best way to the true attitude is simply to say, "All those around me, all the circumstances of my life, all the people near me, are a mirror held up to me by the Divine Consciousness to show me the progress I must make. Everything that shocks me in others means a work I have to do in myself."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 136">This amounts to saying that all knowledge which is not the result of the soul’s vision or experience is without true value.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 137">But the question immediately arises — it was, in fact, put to me — “How do we know what the soul sees?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 138">Obviously there is only one solution: to become conscious of one’s soul. And this completes the aphorism: unless one is conscious of one’s soul one does not have true knowledge. Therefore the first effort must be to find the soul within, to unite with it and allow it to govern one’s life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 139">Some people ask, “How do we know whether this is the soul?” I have already answered this question several times. Those who ask this question, by the very fact of asking it, prove that they are not conscious of their souls, because as soon as you are conscious of your soul and identified with it, you have a</p>
<span id="page_25"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 25</p>
<p class="PE">positive knowledge of it and you no longer ask how you are to know. And that experience can neither be counterfeited nor imagined; you cannot pretend to be in contact with your soul — it is something which cannot be contrived or counterfeited. When the soul governs your life, you know it with absolute certainty and no longer ask any questions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 140">But the usefulness of the aphorism we have just read is to make you understand that everything you think you know, everything you have learnt, anything that has come to you in your life through personal observation, deduction, comparison — all that is a very relative knowledge on which you cannot found a durable and truly effective way of life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 141">How many times have we repeated this: all that comes from the mind is wholly relative. The more the mind is educated and has applied itself to various disciplines, the more it becomes capable of proving that what it puts forward or what it says is true. One can prove the truth of anything by reasoning, but that does not make it true. It remains an opinion, a prejudice, a knowledge based on appearances which are themselves more than dubious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 142">So there seems to be only one way out and that is to go in search of one’s soul and to find it. It is there, it does not make a point of hiding itself, it does not play with you just to make things difficult; on the contrary, it makes great efforts to help you find it and to make itself heard. Only, between your soul and your active consciousness there are two characters who are in the habit of making a lot of noise, the mind and the vital. And because they make a lot of noise, while the soul does not, or, rather, makes as little as possible, their noise prevents you from hearing the voice of the soul.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 143">When you want to know what your soul knows, you have to make an inner effort, to be very attentive; and indeed, if you are attentive, behind the outer noise of the mind and the vital, you can discern something very subtle, very quiet, very peaceful, which knows and says what it knows. But the insistence of the</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 26</p>
<p class="PE"> others is so imperious, while <em>that</em> is so quiet, that you are very easily misled into listening to the one that makes the most noise; most often you become aware only afterwards that the other one was right. It does not impose itself, it does not compel you to listen, for it is without violence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 144">When you hesitate, when you wonder what to do in this or that circumstance, there come the desire, the preference both mental and vital, that press, insist, affirm and impose themselves, and, with the best reasons in the world, build up a whole case for themselves. And if you are not on the alert, if you don’t have a firm discipline, if you don’t have the habit of control, they finally convince you that they are right. And as I was saying a little while ago, they make so much noise that you do not even hear the tiny voice or the tiny, very quiet indication of the soul which says, “Don’t do it.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 145">This “Don’t do it” comes often, but you discard it as something which has no power and follow your impulsive destiny. But if you are truly sincere in your will to find and live the truth, then you learn to listen better and better, you learn to discriminate more and more, and even if it costs you an effort, even if it causes you pain, you learn to obey. And even if you have obeyed only once, it is a powerful help, a considerable progress on the path towards the discrimination between what is and what is not the soul. With this discrimination and the necessary sincerity you are sure to reach the goal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 146">But you must not be in a hurry, you must not be impatient, you must be very persevering. You do the wrong thing ten times for every time that you do the right thing. But when you do the wrong thing you must not give up everything in despair, but tell yourself that the Grace will never abandon you and that next time it will be better.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 147">So, in conclusion, we shall say that in order to know things as they are you must first unite with your soul and to unite with your soul you must want it with persistence and perseverance.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 150">It has often been repeated — but except in certain cases very rarely understood — that only like knows like. If this were understood, a great deal of ignorance would vanish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 151">Only the soul can know the soul, and on each level of being, only the equivalent level can recognise the other. Only the Divine can know the Divine, and because we carry the Divine in ourselves we are capable of seeing Him and recognising Him. But if we try to understand something of the inner life by using our senses and external methods, the result is sure to be total failure and we shall also deceive ourselves totally.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 152">So when you imagine that you can know the secrets of Nature and still remain in a purely physical consciousness, you are entirely deceived. And this habit of demanding concrete, material proofs before accepting the reality of something, is one of the most glaring effects of ignorance. With that attitude any fool imagines that he can sit in judgment on the highest things and deny the most profound experiences.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 153">It is certainly not by dissecting a body which is dead because the soul has departed from it that the soul can be found. Had the soul not departed, the body would not have been dead! It is to bring home to us the absurdity of this claim that Sri Aurobindo has written this aphorism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 154">It applies to all judgments of the critical mind and to all scientific methods when they would judge any but purely material phenomena.</p>

One of the things which would make humanity progress most would be for it to respect what it does not know, to acknowledge willingly that it does not know and is therefore unable to judge. We constantly do just the opposite. We pass final judgments on things of which we have no knowledge whatsoever, and say in a peremptory manner, “This is possible. That is impossible”, when we do not even know what it is we are speaking of. And we put on superior airs because we doubt things of which we have never had any knowledge.</p>

<p class="P" id="aphorism-11" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 158" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">11 – Immortality is not the survival of the mental personality after death, though that also is true, but the waking possession of the unborn and deathless Self of which body is only an instrument and a shadow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 159">There are three statements here which have raised questions. First, “What is the mental personality?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 160">In each human being the body is animated by the vital being, and governed, or partially governed, by a mental being. This is a general rule, but the extent to which the mental being is formed and individualised varies greatly from one individual to the next. In the great mass of human beings the mind is something fluid which has no organisation of its own, and therefore it is not a personality. And as long as the mind is like that, fluid, unorganised, with no cohesive life of its own and without personality, it cannot survive. What made up the mental being dissolves in the mental region when the body, the</p>
<span id="page_29"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="PE">substance which made up the body, dissolves in the physical substance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 161">But as soon as the mental being is formed, organised, individualised, and has become a personality, it does not depend, it no longer depends on the body for its existence, and it therefore survives the body. The earth’s mental atmosphere is filled with beings, mental personalities which lead an entirely independent existence, even after the disappearance of the body; they can reincarnate in a new body when the soul, that is to say, the true Self, reincarnates, thus carrying with it the memory of its previous lives.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 162">But this is not what Sri Aurobindo calls Immortality. Immortality is a life without beginning or end, without birth or death, which is altogether independent of the body. It is the life of the Self, the essential being of each individual, and it is not separate from the universal Self. And this essential being has a sense of oneness with the universal Self; it is in fact a personified, individualised expression of the universal Self and has neither beginning nor end, neither life nor death, it exists eternally and that is what is immortal. When we are fully conscious of this Self we participate in its eternal life, and we therefore become immortal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 163">But there is some misunderstanding about this word “Immortality” — and this is not something new; it is a misunderstanding which has recurred very frequently. When one speaks of immortality most people understand it as the indefinite survival of the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 164">The body can survive indefinitely only if, in the first place, it becomes fully conscious of this immortal Self and unites with it, identifies with it to the extent of having the same capacity, the same faculty of constant transformation which would enable it to follow the universal movement. This is an absolutely indispensable condition if the body is to endure. Because the body is rigid, because it does not follow the movement, because it cannot transform itself rapidly enough to constantly identify itself with</p>
<span id="page_30"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 30</p>
<p class="PE">the universal evolution, it decomposes and dies. Its fixity, its rigidity, its incapacity to transform itself, make its destruction necessary, so that its substance may return to the general realm of physical substance and so that the body may be remoulded into new forms in order to become capable of further progress. But usually, when one speaks of immortality, people think of physical immortality — it goes without saying that this has not yet been realised.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 165">Sri Aurobindo says that it is possible and even that it will happen, but he lays down one condition: the body must be supra-mentalised, it must have some of the qualities of the supramental being, which are qualities of plasticity and constant transformation. And when Sri Aurobindo writes that the body is “only an instrument and a shadow”, he is speaking of the body as it is now and will probably continue to be for a long time to come. It is only the instrument of the Self, a very inadequate expression of this Self, and a shadow — a shadow, something vague and obscure in comparison with the light and precision of the eternal Self.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 166">How this shadow, this instrument, can serve the development of the soul, and how by cultivating the instrument one can be of help to future lives, are questions which are not without interest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 167">Each time that the soul takes birth in a new body it comes with the intention of having a new experience which will help it to develop and to perfect its personality. This is how the psychic being is formed from life to life and becomes a completely conscious and independent personality which, once it has arrived at the summit of its development, is free to choose not only the time of its incarnation, but the place, the purpose and the work to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 168">Its descent into the physical body is necessarily a descent into darkness, ignorance, unconsciousness; and for a very long time it must labour simply to bring a little consciousness into the material substance of the body, before it can make use</p>
<span id="page_31"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 31</p>
<p class="PE">of it for the experience it has come for. So, if we cultivate the body by a clear-sighted and rational method, at the same time we are helping the growth of the soul, its progress and enlightenment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 169">Physical culture is the process of infusing consciousness into the cells of the body. One may or may not know it, but it is a fact. When we concentrate to make our muscles move according to our will, when we endeavour to make our limbs more supple, to give them an agility, or a force, or a resistance, or a plasticity which they do not naturally possess, we infuse into the cells of the body a consciousness which was not there before, thus turning it into an increasingly homogeneous and receptive instrument, which progresses in and by its activities. This is the primary importance of physical culture. Of course, that is not the only thing that brings consciousness into the body, but it is something which acts in an overall way, and this is rare. I have already told you several times that the artist infuses a very great consciousness into his hands, as the intellectual does into his brain. But these are, as it were, local phenomena, whereas the action of physical culture is more general. And when one sees the absolutely marvellous results of this culture, when one observes the extent to which the body is capable of perfecting itself, one understands how useful this can be to the action of the psychic being which has entered into this material substance. For naturally, when it is in possession of an organised and harmonised instrument which is full of strength and suppleness and possibilities, its task is greatly facilitated.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 170">I do not say that people who practise physical culture necessarily do it for this purpose, because very few are aware of this result. But whether they are aware of it or not, this is the result. Moreover, if you are at all sensitive, when you observe the moving body of a person who has practised physical culture in a methodical and rational way, you see a light, a consciousness, a life, which is not there in others.</p>
<span id="page_32"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 32</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 171">There are always people with a wholly external view of things who say, “Workers, for example, who have to do hard physical labour and who are compelled by their work to learn to carry heavy weights — they too build up their muscles, and instead of spending their time like aristocrats doing exercises with no useful outward results, they at least produce something.” This is ignorance. Because there is an essential difference between the muscles developed through specialised, local and limited use and muscles which have been cultivated deliberately and harmoniously according to an integral pro-gramme which leaves no part of the body without work or exercise.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 172">People like workers and peasants, who have a specialised occupation and develop only certain muscles, always end up with occupational deformities. And this in no way helps their psychic progress because, although the whole of life necessarily contributes to the psychic development, it does so in such an unconscious way and so slowly that the poor psychic being must come back again and again and again, indefinitely, to achieve its purpose. Therefore we can say without fear of being mistaken that physical culture is the sadhana of the body and that all sadhana necessarily helps to hasten the achievement of the goal. The more consciously you do it, the quicker and more general the result, but even if you do it blindly, if you can see no further than the tips of your fingers or your feet or your nose, you help the overall development.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 173">Finally, one can say that any discipline that is followed rigorously, sincerely, deliberately, is a considerable help, for it enables life on earth to attain its goal more rapidly and prepares it to receive the new life. To discipline oneself is to hasten the arrival of this new life and the contact with the supramental reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 174">As it is, the physical body is truly nothing but a very disfigured shadow of the eternal life of the Self. But this physical body is capable of progressive development; through each individual formation, the physical substance progresses, and one day it will</p>
<span id="page_33"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 33</p>
<p class="PE">be capable of building a bridge between physical life as we know it and the supramental life which is to manifest.</p>

Afterwards I saw God, for He came and embraced me. And now which am I to believe, the reasonings of others or my own experience?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 176">Sri Aurobindo is not asking a question, but rather making an ironic comment. It is to bring out clearly the stupidity of the reasonings of the mind, which imagines it can speak of what it does not know. It is nothing else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 177">You can prove anything with the mind. When you know how to use it and have mastered reasoning and deduction, you can prove anything. As a matter of fact, this is an exercise that is given in universities to make the mind supple: you are given a thesis to prove and immediately afterwards, with equal conviction, you have to prove its antithesis — in the hope that if you rise a little above both, you will discover the synthesis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 178">Therefore, once it is conceded that anything can be proved, it follows that reasoning leads nowhere; because if you can prove something and in the next moment prove its opposite, this is the proof that your proofs are worthless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 179">There is experience. For a simple heart, a sincere and honest nature, a nature which knows that its experience is sincere, that it is not a falsification of desire or of mental ambition, but a spontaneous movement which comes from the soul — the experience is absolutely convincing. It loses its power of conviction when the desire to have an experience, or the ambition to think oneself very superior, becomes mixed with it. If you have that in you, then beware, because desires and ambitions falsify experience. The mind is a formative power, and if you have a very strong desire for something very important and very interesting to happen</p>

<p class="PE">to you, you can make it happen, at least in the eyes of those who see things superficially. But apart from these cases, if you are honest, sincere, spontaneous, and especially when experiences come to you without any effort on your part to have them, and as a spontaneous expression of your deeper aspiration, then these experiences carry with them the seal of an absolute authenticity; and even if the whole world tells you that they are nonsense and illusion, it does not change your personal convictions. But naturally, for this, you must not deceive yourself. You must be sincere and honest with a complete inner rectitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 180">Someone has asked me, “How is it possible for God to reveal Himself to an unbeliever?” That’s very funny; because if it pleases God to reveal Himself to an unbeliever, I don’t see what would prevent Him from doing so!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 181">On the contrary, He has a sense of humour—Sri Aurobindo has told us many times already that the Supreme has a sense of humour, that <em>we</em> are the ones who want to make Him into a grave and invariably serious character—and He may find it very amusing to come and embrace an unbeliever. Someone who has only the day before declared, "God does not exist. I do not believe in Him. All that is folly and ignorance....", He gathers him into His arms, He presses him to His heart—and He laughs in his face.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 182">Everything is possible, even things which to our small and limited intelligence seem absurd.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 183">Indeed, it is only when we have come to the end of these aphorisms that we will be able to understand them; because with each one, Sri Aurobindo places us in an entirely different position with regard to the truth to be discovered. There are innumerable facets. There are innumerable points of view. One can say the most contradictory things without being inconsistent or contradicting oneself. Everything depends on the way in which you look at it. And even once we have seen everything, from all the points of view accessible to us, around the central Truth, we will still have had only a very small glimpse — the</p>
<span id="page_35"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 184">Truth will escape us on all sides at once. But what is remarkable is that once we have had the experience of a single contact with the Divine, a true, spontaneous and sincere experience, at that moment, in that experience, we will know everything, and even more. That is why it is so important to live the little you know in all sincerity in order to make yourself capable of having experiences, and of knowing by experience, not mentally, but because you live these things, because they become a part of your being and consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 185">To put into practice the little you know is the best way to learn more; it is the most powerful means of advancing on the way — a little bit of really sincere practice. For example, not to do something that you know must not be done. When you have seen a weakness, a disability in your being, you must not allow it to happen again. When, if only for a moment, you have had the vision of what you must be, in an ardent aspiration, you must not — you must never forget to become that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 186">Some people are always complaining about their disabilities. But that doesn’t lead you very far. If, once, you have truly seen your weaknesses and truly, sincerely understood, seen that you must not be like that — that’s the end of complaining. Then there is the daily effort, the building up of the will, the vigilance of every moment — you must never allow a recognised mistake to renew itself. To err through ignorance, to err through unconsciousness, is obviously very unfortunate, but it can be put right. Whereas to go on making the same mistake, knowing that it must not be made, is an act of cowardice which we must not permit ourselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 187">To say, “Oh, human nature is like this. Oh, we are in the inconscience. Oh, we are in the ignorance” — all this is laziness and weakness. And behind this laziness and weakness there is a huge bad will. There!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 193">In this aphorism, by “they” Sri Aurobindo means the materialists, the scientists and, in a general way, all those who only believe in physical reality and consider human reason to be the one infallible judge. Furthermore, the “things” he speaks of here are all the perceptions that belong to worlds other than the material, all that one can see with eyes other than the physical, all the experiences that one can have in subtle domains from the sense perceptions of the vital world to the bliss of the Divine Presence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 194">It was while discussing these and other similar “things” that Sri Aurobindo was told that they were “hallucinations”. When you look up the word “hallucination” in the dictionary, you find this definition: “Morbid sensation not produced by any real object. Objectless perception.” Sri Aurobindo interprets this or puts it more precisely: “A subjective or psychical experience which corresponds to no objective or no physical reality.” There could be no better definition of these phenomena of the inner consciousness, which are most precious to man and make him something more than a mere thinking animal. Human reason is so limited, so down to earth, so arrogantly ignorant that it wants to discredit by a pejorative word the very faculties which open</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What does the "artist" represent here?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 196">Here Sri Aurobindo compares the work of the Supreme Lord, creator of the universe, to the work of an artist painting in his conscious being, with sweeping brush-strokes, as on a canvas, the picture of the world.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 197">Usually the word “coincidence” suggests unconscious, meaningless chance.

Superstition arises from the mind’s wrong understanding of these reflections. There is no other hallucination.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Can hallucinations be compared to visions?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 199">A vision is a perception, by the visual organs, of phenomena that really exist in a world corresponding to the organ which sees.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 200">For example, to the individual vital plane there corresponds a cosmic vital world. When a human being is sufficiently developed he possesses an individualised vital being with organs of sight, hearing, smell, etc. So a person who has a well-developed vital being can see in the vital world with his vital sight, consciously and with the memory of what he has seen. This is what makes a vision.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 202">On the other hand, Sri Aurobindo tells us that what is termed a hallucination is the reflection in the mind or the physical senses of that which is beyond our mind and our ordinary senses; it is therefore not a direct vision, but a reflected image which is usually not understood or explained. This character of uncertainty produces an impression of unreality and gives rise to all kinds of superstition. This is also why “serious” people, or people who think themselves serious, do not accord any value to these phenomena and call them hallucinations. And yet, in those who are interested in occult phenomena, this type of perception often precedes the emergence of the capacity of vision which may be in course of formation. But you must guard against mistaking this for true vision. For, I repeat, these phenomena occur most often in a state of almost complete ignorance and</p>

The physical mind itself can receive the divine influence and be transformed by it, but so long as it remains the physical mind, it can neither understand nor explain God, much less know Him; for to know God one must be identified with Him and for that the physical mind must cease to be what it is now, and consequently cease to be the physical mind.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 225">Sri Aurobindo himself gives us the Divine's answer: "Forgive whom and what?" The Lord knows that all is Himself and therefore that all actions are His and all things are Himself. To forgive, one must be <em>other</em> than the one who is forgiven and the thing to be forgiven must have been done by someone other than oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 226">The truth is that when you ask forgiveness you hope that the dire consequences of what you have done will be wiped away. But that is possible only if the causes of the error you have committed have themselves disappeared. If you have made a mistake through ignorance, the ignorance must disappear. If you have made a mistake through bad will, the bad will must disappear and be replaced by goodwill. Mere regret will not do, it must be accompanied by a step forward.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 265">In modern “civilised” life, parents and teachers, by their practical and rational “good advice”, lose no time in covering up this spontaneity which they call unconsciousness, and substituting for it a very small, very narrow, limited mental ego, withdrawn into itself, crammed with notions of misbehaviour and sin and punishment or of personal interest, calculation and profit; all of which has the inevitable result of increasing vital desires through repression, fear or self-justification.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 266">And yet for the sake of completeness it should be added that because man is a mental being, he must necessarily in the course of his evolution leave behind this unconscious and spontaneous purity, which is very similar to the purity of the animal, and after passing through an unavoidable period of mental perversion and impurity, rise beyond the mind into the higher and luminous purity of the divine consciousness.</p>

Besides, this habit of being sombre, morose, of despairing, does not truly depend on events, but on a lack of faith in the nature. One who has faith, even if only in himself, can face all difficulties, all circumstances, even the most adverse, without discouragement or despair. He fights like a man to the end. Natures that lack faith also lack endurance and courage.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 270">Sri Aurobindo tells us that for human beings the degree of success in physical life depends on the degree of harmony between the individual and universal physical Nature.

Most often the accuracy of the documents is doubtful, and the information they supply is poor, incomplete, trivial and frequently distorted. As a whole, the official version of human history is nothing but a long, almost unbroken record of violent aggressions: wars, revolutions, murders or colonisations. True, some of these aggressions and massacres have been adorned with flattering terms and epithets; they have been called religious wars, holy wars, civilising campaigns; but they nonetheless remain acts of greed or vengeance.</p>

So your logic may be indisputable, but if your starting-point is wrong, your conclusions will also be wrong, in spite of the correctness of your logic, or rather, because of it. The same holds true for self-righteousness, which is a feeling of virtuous superiority. Your virtue makes you disdainful of others, and this pride — which fills you with disdain for those who, according to you, are less virtuous than you are — makes your virtue completely worthless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 335">That is why Sri Aurobindo tells us in his aphorism that logic is the worst enemy of Truth, just as the feeling of virtuous superiority is the worst enemy of virtue.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 348">How can one help to cure evil and ugliness?... One may say that there is a kind of hierarchy of collaboration or action: there is a negative help and a positive help.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 349">To begin with, there is a way that might be called negative, the way provided by Buddhism and kindred religions: not to see. First of all, to be in such a state of purity and beauty that you do not perceive ugliness and evil — it is like something that does not touch you because it does not exist in you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 350">That is the perfection of the negative method. It is quite elementary: never to notice evil, never to speak of the evil in others, not to perpetuate these vibrations by observation, by criticism, by insistence on what is bad. That is what the Buddha taught: each time you speak of an evil, you help to spread it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 351">This barely touches the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 352">Yet it should be a very general rule. But people who criticise have an answer for that; they say, “If you do not see the evil, you will never be able to cure it. If you leave someone in his ugliness, he will never get out of it.” This is not true, but that is how they justify their behaviour. So in this aphorism Sri Aurobindo forestalls these objections: it is not because of ignorance or unconsciousness or indifference that you do not see the evil — you are quite capable of seeing it, even of feeling it, but you refuse to help to spread it by giving it the force of your attention and the support of your consciousness. And for that you must yourself be above this perception and feeling; you must be able to see the evil or the ugliness without suffering from it, without being shocked or disturbed by it. You see it from a height where these things do not exist, but you have the conscious perception</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 353">The second step is to be <em>positively</em> conscious of the supreme Good and supreme Beauty behind all things, which sustains all things and enables them to exist. When you see Him, you are able to perceive Him behind this mask and this distortion; even this ugliness, this wickedness, this evil is a disguise of Something which is essentially beautiful or good, luminous, pure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 354">Then comes the <em>true</em> collaboration, for when you have this vision, this perception, when you live in this consciousness, it also gives you the power to <em>draw</em> That down into the manifestation, to the earth, and to bring It into contact with what now distorts and disguises, so that little by little this distortion and this disguise are transformed by the influence of the Truth that is behind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 355">Here we are at the very summit of the scale of collaboration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 356">In this way it is not necessary to introduce the principle of love into the explanation. But if you want to know or understand the nature of the Force or the Power that enables or brings about this transformation — particularly where evil is concerned, but also with ugliness to a certain extent — you see that love is obviously the most potent and integral of all powers — integral in the sense that it applies in all cases. It is even more powerful than the power of purification which dissolves all bad will and which is, as it were, the master of the adverse forces, but which has not the direct power of transformation. The power of purification first dissolves in order to allow the transformation afterwards. It destroys one form in order to be able to create a better one, whereas love need not dissolve in order to transform; it possesses the direct power of transformation. Love is like a flame that changes what is hard into something malleable and even sublimates this malleable thing into a kind of purified vapour — it does not destroy, it transforms.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 357">In its essence, in its origin, love is like a flame, a white flame which overcomes <em>all</em> resistances. You can experience this yourself: whatever the difficulty in your being, whatever</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 358">And it is very easy to explain how a person who has this experience can spread it, can act on others; because to have the experience you must touch the one, supreme Essence of the whole manifestation, the Origin and the Essence, the Source and the Reality of all that is; and at once you enter the realm of Unity — there is no longer any separation of individuals, there is only one single vibration that can be repeated indefinitely in external form.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="72-11" href="#">11</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 359">If you rise high enough, you find yourself at the heart of all things. And what is manifest in this heart can manifest in all things. That is the great secret, the secret of the divine incarnation in an individual form, because in the normal course of things what manifests at the centre is realised in the external form only with the awakening and the response of the will in the individual form. Whereas if the central Will is represented constantly and permanently in an individual being, this individual being can serve as an intermediary between this Will and all beings, and will for them. Everything this individual being perceives and offers in his consciousness to the supreme Will is answered as if it came from each individual being. And if for any reason the individual elements have a more or less conscious and voluntary relation with that representative being, their relation increases the efficacy, the effectiveness of the representative individual; and thus the supreme Action can act in</p>

Someone asked him, “Why does it not come immediately?” He answered something like this: if divine love were to manifest in its essence upon earth, it would be like a bombshell; because the earth is neither supple nor receptive enough to be able to widen itself to the dimensions of this love. It not only needs to open, but to widen itself and to become more supple — Matter is still too rigid. And even the substance of the physical consciousness — not only the most material Matter, but the substance of the physical consciousness — is too rigid.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 364">There is not a single sin that is not our sin.... You have this experience when for some reason or other—depending on the case—you come into contact with the universal state of consciousness—not in its limitless essence, but on any level of Matter. There is an atomic consciousness; there is a purely material consciousness; and there is, even more, a general psychological consciousness. When by going within, by a kind of withdrawal from the ego, you come into contact with this zone of consciousness, let us say, a terrestrial or collective human psychological zone—there is a difference, "collective human" is restrictive, whereas "terrestrial" includes many animal movements, even plant movements; but as in the present case the moral notion of guilt, sin, evil belongs exclusively to the human consciousness, we will say simply the collective human psychological consciousness—when you come into contact with that through this identification, naturally you feel or see or know that you are capable of any human movement anywhere. It is to some extent a truth-consciousness—this egoistic sense of what belongs and does not belong to you, of what you can do and cannot do, disappears at that time; you become aware that the fundamental structure of the human consciousness is such that any human being is capable of doing anything at all. And since you are in a truth-consciousness, at the same time you have the feeling that judgments or aversions, or rejection, are absurd. <em>Everything</em> is potentially there. And if certain currents of force—which you usually cannot trace; you see them come and go, but as a rule their origin and direction are unknown—if any one of these currents enters into you, it can make you do anything.</p>

<p class="PE">of Agni, the flame of purification and progress — you would be able not only to prevent these movements from taking an active form in you and expressing themselves materially, but also to act on the very nature of the movement and transform it. But, of course, unless you have attained a very high degree of realisation, it will be practically impossible to maintain this state of consciousness for long. Almost immediately you fall back into the egoistic consciousness of the separate self. And then all the difficulties come back: the disgust, the revolt against certain things, the horror they arouse in you, etc.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 366">It is probable—it is even certain—that until you are yourself completely transformed, these movements of disgust and revolt are needed so that you can do <em>in yourself</em> what has to be done to shut the door. For after all, the problem is not to allow them to manifest themselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 367">In another aphorism Sri Aurobindo says — I no longer remember his exact words — that sin is merely something which is not in its right place. In this perpetual Becoming nothing ever repeats itself, and there are things that disappear, so to speak, into the past; and when their disappearance becomes necessary these things become, for our very limited consciousness, bad and repulsive. And we revolt against them because their time is over. But if we had the overall view, if we could contain within ourselves the past, the present and the future all at once — as it is somewhere above — we would see the relativity of these things and that it is above all the progressive Force of evolution that gives us the will to reject; and that wherever they are in their right place, they are quite acceptable. Only, it is practically impossible to have this experience unless you have the total vision, that is to say, the vision that belongs to the Supreme alone! Therefore you must first of all identify yourself with the Supreme; then, afterwards, with this identification, you can return to a sufficiently exteriorised consciousness and see things as they are. But that is the principle, and to the extent that you are capable of realising it, you reach a state of consciousness where you can</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 368">Naturally, people who do not think deeply enough will say, “Ah, but if we saw that everything is as it should be, nothing would move!” No, you cannot prevent things from moving! Even for a fraction of a second they do not stop moving. It is a continuous, total transformation, a movement that never ceases. And because it is difficult for us to feel like this, it is possible for us to imagine that if we were to enter into certain states of consciousness, things would not change. But even if we were to enter into an apparently total inertia, things would continue to change and so would we!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 369">Basically, disgust, revolt, anger, all these movements of violence are necessarily movements of ignorance and limitation, with all the weakness that limitation represents. Revolt is a weakness — it is the feeling of an impotent will. You will — or you think you will — you feel, you see that things are not as they should be and you revolt against whatever does not agree with what you see. But if you were all-powerful, if your will and your vision were all-powerful, there would be no occasion for you to revolt, you would always see that all things are as they should be. If we go to the highest level and unite with the consciousness of the supreme Will, we see, at every second, at every moment of the universe, that all is exactly as it should be, exactly as the Supreme wills it. That is omnipotence. And all movements of violence become not only unnecessary but utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 370">Therefore there is only one solution: to unite ourselves by aspiration, concentration, interiorisation and identification with the supreme Will. And that is both omnipotence and perfect freedom at the same time. And that is the only omnipotence and the only freedom; everything else is an approximation. You may be on the way, but it is not the entire thing. So if you experience this, you realise that with this supreme freedom and supreme power there is also a total peace and a serenity that never fails. Therefore, if you feel something which is not that, a revolt, a</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 380">I feel like asking you a question myself! Because your question can be understood in two ways. One can take it in the same spirit of irony and humour that Sri Aurobindo has put in his aphorism, when he marvels at man’s capacity for self-deception. That is to say, you are putting yourself in the place of someone who is deceiving himself and you say, “But I am acting in good faith! I always want the good of others, etc. — the welfare of humanity, to serve the Divine, that goes without saying! And how can I be deceiving myself?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 381">But actually there are two ways of deceiving oneself, which are very different. For example, you may very well be shocked by certain things, not for personal reasons, but precisely in your goodwill and eagerness to serve the Divine, when you see people behaving badly, being selfish, unfaithful and treacherous. There is a stage where you have overcome these things and no longer allow them to manifest in yourself, but to the extent that you are linked to the ordinary consciousness, the ordinary point of view, the ordinary life, the ordinary way of thinking, they are still possible, they exist latently because they are the reverse of the qualities that you are striving to attain. And this opposition still exists — until you rise above it and no longer have either the quality or the defect. So long as you have the virtue, its opposite is always latent in you; it is only when you are above both the virtue and the defect that it disappears.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 382">So this kind of indignation that you feel comes from the fact that you are not altogether above it; you are at the stage where you thoroughly disapprove and could not do it yourself.

<p class="PE">to have and how you react to others. Because anger is a deformation of the vital power, an obscure and wholly unregenerated vital, a vital that is still subject to all the ordinary actions and reactions. When this vital power is used by an ignorant and egoistic individual will and this will meets with opposition from other individual wills around it, this power, under the pressure of opposition, changes into anger and tries to obtain by violence what cannot be achieved solely by the pressure of the force itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 383">Besides, anger, like every other kind of violence, is always a sign of weakness, impotence and incapacity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 384">And here self-deception comes solely from the approval given to it or the flattering epithet attached to it — because anger can only be something blind, ignorant and asuric, that is to say, contrary to the light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 385">But this is still the best case.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 386">There is another one. There are people who without knowing it—or because <em>they want</em> to ignore it—always follow their personal interest, their preferences, their attachments, their conceptions; people who are not wholly consecrated to the Divine and who make use of moral and yogic ideas to conceal their personal impulses.

Life was wholly spontaneous and natural, just as a more luminous and more conscious animal life would be; but there were none of the complications and distortions that the mind brought in later in the course of its development. I have the memory of that life — I had it, I relived it when I became conscious of the life of the earth as a whole. But I cannot say how long it lasted nor what area it covered. I do not know. I can only remember the condition, the state, what material Nature was like, what the human form and the human consciousness were like at that time and this kind of harmony with all the other elements on earth — harmony with animal life, and such a great harmony with plant life. There was a kind of spontaneous knowledge of how to use the things of Nature, of the properties of plants, of fruits and everything vegetable Nature could provide.

I have a very clear vision of this place and a very clear awareness of this life and its forms, but I cannot give any material details.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 452">Whatever the image — what we disdainfully call an idol — whatever the external form of the deity, even if to our physical eye it appears ugly or commonplace or horrible, a caricature, there is always within it the presence of the thing it represents. And there is always someone, a priest or an initiate, or a sadhu, a sannyasin, who has the power and who draws — this is usually the work of the priests — who draws the force, the presence within. And it is real: it is quite true that the force, the presence is there; and it is that, not the form of wood or stone or metal, which people worship — it is the presence.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 454">People who say that are fools who don’t even know what they are talking about. You only have to read all that Sri Aurobindo has written to know that it is impossible to base a religion on his works, because he presents each problem, each question in all its aspects, showing the truth contained in each way of seeing things, and he explains that in order to attain the Truth you must realise a synthesis which goes beyond all mental notions and emerge into a transcendence beyond thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 455">So the second part of your question is meaningless. Besides, if you had read what was published in the last <em>Bulletin</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95-23" href="#">23</a> you could not have asked this question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 456">I repeat that when we speak of Sri Aurobindo there can be no question of a teaching nor even of a revelation, but of an action from the Supreme; no religion can be founded on that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 457">But men are so foolish that they can change anything into a religion, so great is their need of a fixed framework for their narrow thought and limited action. They do not feel secure unless they can assert this is true and that is not; but such an assertion becomes impossible for anyone who has read and understood what Sri Aurobindo has written. Religion and Yoga do not belong to the same plane of being and spiritual life can exist in all its purity only when it is free from all mental dogma.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 459">Each case is different. It all depends on the degree of the individual’s development in his different parts and on how well these parts are organised around the psychic centre. The more organised the being, the more consciously lasting it becomes. We can say in a general way that each person brings into his present life the consequences of his previous lives, without, however, preserving the memory of these lives. Apart from a few very rare exceptions, only when you are united with your psychic being and become fully conscious of it do you obtain, at the same time, the memory of past lives, which the psychic preserves in its consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 460">Otherwise, even in those who are most sensitive, these memories are fragmentary, uncertain and intermittent. Most often they are hardly recognisable and seem to be nothing more than indefinable impressions. And yet a person who knows how to see through appearances will be able to perceive a kind of similarity in the sequence of events in his life.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 465">It is the very definition of folly that Sri Aurobindo gives here. A mask is something that conceals, that makes invisible what it covers. And if the mask is distorted, it not only renders invisible what it conceals but also totally changes its nature. So, according to this definition, folly is something that veils and distorts beyond all recognition the Truth which is at the origin of all things.</p>

But what does "destroyed" mean? Their form? Their form of consciousness can be dissolved, but that "something" which makes them exist, which makes all things exist—how could that be destroyed? The universe is an objectivisation, an objective self-discovery of That which <em>is</em> from all eternity. So? How can the All cease to be?

But how could what is without form be destroyed?</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 101</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 485">People are so deeply imbued with the Christian idea of “God the Creator” — the creation on one side and God on the other. When you think about it you reject it, but it has penetrated into the sensations and feelings; so, spontaneously, instinctively, almost subconsciously, you attribute to God everything you consider to be best and most beautiful and, above all, everything you want to attain, to realise. Naturally, each one changes the content of his God according to his own consciousness, but it is always what he considers to be best. And that is also why instinctively and spontaneously, subconsciously, you are shocked by the idea that God can be things that you do not like, that you do not approve of or do not think best.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 486">I put that rather childishly, on purpose, so that you can understand it properly. But it is like that — I am sure, because I observed it in myself for a very long time, because of the subconscious formation of childhood, environment, education, etc. You must be able to press into this body the consciousness of Oneness, the absolute exclusive Oneness of the Divine — exclusive in the sense that nothing exists except in this Oneness, even the things we find most repulsive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 487">And this is what Sri Aurobindo is fighting, for he too had this Christian education, he too had to struggle; and these aphorisms are the result — the flowering, as it were — of this necessity of fighting a subconscious formation. For that is what makes you ask such questions: “How can God be weak? How can God be foolish? How...?” But there is nothing other than God, only He exists, there is nothing outside Him. And if something seems ugly to us, it is simply because He no longer wants it to exist. He is preparing the world so that this thing may no longer be manifested, so that the manifestation can move from that state to something else. So naturally, within us, we violently repulse everything that is about to go out of the active manifestation — there is a movement of rejection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 488">But it is Him. There is nothing but Him. This is what we should repeat to ourselves from morning to evening and from</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 490">So, to ask a question like this is still to react like those who make a distinction between what is and what is not Divine or rather between what is and what is not God. “How can He be weak?” It is a question I cannot ask.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I understand, but they speak of the Lila, the divine play; so He is standing back, as it were. He is not really entirely "involved", not really absolutely in the play.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 491">Yes, yes, He is! He is totally in it. He himself is the Play.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 492">We speak of God, but we should remember that there are all these gradations of consciousness; and when we speak of God and His Play, we mean God in His transcendent state, beyond all the levels of matter, and when we speak of the Play we speak of God in his material state. So we say: Transcendent God is watching and playing — in Himself, by Himself, with Himself — His material game.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 493">But all language is a language of ignorance. Our entire way of expressing ourselves, everything we say and the way in which we say it, is necessarily ignorance. And that is why it is so difficult to express something which is concretely true; this would require explanations which would themselves be full of falsehood, of course, or else extremely long. This is why Sri Aurobindo’s sentences are sometimes very long, precisely because he strives to escape from this ignorant language.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 494">Our very way of thinking is wrong. The believers, the faithful, all of them — particularly in the West — when they speak of God, think of Him as “something else”, they think that He cannot be weak, ugly or imperfect — they think wrongly, they divide, they separate. It is subconscious, unreflecting thought; they are in the habit of thinking like this instinctively; they do not watch themselves thinking. For example, when they speak of</p>
<span id="page_103"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 495">“perfection” in a general way, they see or feel or postulate precisely the sum-total of everything they consider to be virtuous, divine, beautiful, admirable — but it is not that at all! Perfection is something which lacks nothing. The divine perfection is the Divine in His entirety, which lacks nothing. The divine perfection is the Divine as a whole, from whom nothing has been taken away — so it is just the opposite! For the moralists divine perfection means all the virtues that they represent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 496">From the true point of view, perfection is the whole (<em>Mother makes a global gesture</em>), and it is precisely the fact that there can be nothing outside the whole. It is impossible that anything should be missing, because it is impossible for anything not to form part of the whole. There can be nothing which is not in the whole. Let me explain. A given universe may not contain everything, for a universe is a mode of manifestation; but there is every possible kind of universe. So I always come back to the same thing: there can be nothing which does not form part of the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 497">Therefore one can say that each thing is in its place, exactly as it should be, and that relations between things are exactly as they should be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 498">But perfection is only one special way of approaching the Divine; it is one side, and in the same way there are innumerable sides, angles or aspects, innumerable ways of approaching the Divine, for example: will, truth, purity, perfection, unity, immortality, eternity, infinity, silence, peace, existence, consciousness, etc. The number of approaches is almost unlimited. With each one you approach or draw near or enter into contact with the Divine through one aspect and if you really do it, you find that the difference is merely in the most external form, but the contact is identical. It is as if you were turning around a centre, a globe, and seeing it from many different angles as in a kaleidoscope; but once the contact is made, it is the same thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 499">Perfection is therefore a global way of approaching the Divine: everything is there and everything is as it should be</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 104</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 500">— “should be”, that is to say, a perfect expression of the Divine; one cannot even say of His Will, for if you say “His Will” it is still something outside Him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 501">One can also say — but this is far, far below it — that He is what He is and exactly as He wants to be — with this “exactly as He wants to be”, one has come down by a considerable number of steps! But this is to give you the point of view of perfection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 502">Besides, divine perfection implies infinity and eternity; that is to say, everything coexists outside time and space.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 503">It is like the word “purity”; one could hold forth interminably on the difference between divine purity and what people call purity. The divine purity, at the lowest, allows no influence other than the divine influence — at the lowest. But that is already very much distorted; the divine purity means that there is only the Divine, nothing else — it is perfectly pure, there is only the Divine, there is nothing other than Him.</p>

And so, when each thing is exactly in its place, from the most stupendous to the most microscopic, the whole will express the Supreme progressively, without any need of being withdrawn to be emanated again. On this Sri Aurobindo based the fact that in this creation, in this universe, the perfection of a divine world — what Sri Aurobindo calls the Supermind — will be able to manifest. Equilibrium is the essential law of this creation and this is why perfection can be realised in the manifestation.</p>

When one comes out of this consciousness and enters into the Truth-consciousness; the difference is such that one wonders how there can be anything like suffering and misery and death and all that. There is a kind of astonishment in the sense that one does not understand how it can happen — when one has really tipped over to the other side. But this experience is usually associated with the experience of the unreality of the world as we know it, whereas Sri Aurobindo says that this perception of the unreality of the world is not necessary to live in the supramental consciousness — it is only the unreality of Falsehood, not the unreality of the world. That is to say, the world has a reality of its own, independent of Falsehood.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 526">Then I put myself in contact again with this experience of the supramental boat. My vision of things has not changed since. And I realised that the experience had had a decisive effect on the situation; it established the required conditions very clearly, very precisely, very definitively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 527">Once and for all it swept away not only all the ordinary notions of morality, but everything that is considered here in India as necessary for the spiritual life. From this point of view it was very instructive. First of all this kind of so-called ascetic purity. Ascetic purity is simply the rejection of all vital movements; instead of taking up these movements and turning them towards the Divine, that is to say, instead of seeing the supreme Presence in them and letting the Supreme act freely on them, you tell Him, “No, that is not your concern.” He is not allowed to interfere with them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 528">As for the physical, it is an old story, everyone knows: the ascetics have always rejected it, but then they added the vital. Only the things that were classically recognised as sacred or permitted by religious tradition, as for example, the sanctity of marriage and things like that, were accepted, but to live freely — oh! that was incompatible with any religious life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 529">So all that was completely swept away once and for all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 530">Which is not to say, however, that what is required is any easier. It is probably much more difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 531">First of all, from the psychological point of view, there must be the condition I spoke about in the story of the stag: perfect equality. It is an absolute condition. I have observed since 1956, for years, that no supramental vibration can be transmitted except in this perfect equality. If there is the least opposition to this equality — in fact the least movement of ego, any preference of</p>

<p class="PE">the ego, it does not come through, it is not transmitted. This is already difficult enough.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 532">Added to this, there are two conditions for the realisation to become total and they are not easily fulfilled. It is not very difficult on the intellectual plane — I am not speaking here of just anyone at all but of people who have already practised yoga and followed a discipline — it is relatively easy; on the psychological plane too, if you bring in this equality, it is not very difficult. But as soon as you come to the material plane, that is, the physical and then the body, it is not easy. The two conditions are: first, a power of expansion, of widening, that is unlimited, so to say, so that you can widen yourself to the dimension of the supramental consciousness, which is total. The supramental consciousness is the consciousness of the Supreme in His totality — when I say “His totality”, I mean the Supreme in His aspect of Manifestation. Naturally, from the higher point of view, the point of view of the essence — the essence of what becomes the Supermind in the Manifestation — there must be a capacity for total identification with the Supreme, not only in His aspect of Manifestation, but also in his static or nirvanic aspect, beyond the Manifestation — Non-Being. But in addition to this, one must be able to identify oneself with the Supreme in the Becoming. This implies two things: first a widening that is at least unlimited, as I have said, and at the same time a total plasticity in order to be able to follow the Supreme in His Becoming. It is not at one particular moment that one must be as wide as the universe, but indefinitely, in the Becoming. These are the two conditions; they must be there potentially.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 533">So long as there is no question of physical transformation, the psychological and, in a large measure, subjective point of view is sufficient. And that is relatively easy. But when it comes to including Matter in the work, Matter as it is in this world, where the very starting-point itself is wrong — we start from Inconscience and Ignorance — then it is very difficult. Because, in fact, so that this Matter could reach the individualisation</p>
<span id="page_112"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 112</p>
<p class="PE">needed to recover the lost Consciousness, it was made with a certain fixity indispensable to make forms last and precisely to maintain this possibility of individuality. And that is the chief obstacle to the widening, the plasticity, the suppleness needed to be able to receive the supermind. I am constantly faced with this problem, which is a very concrete, absolutely material one, when one is dealing with these cells which must remain cells and not evaporate into a reality which is no longer physical. And at the same time, they must have this suppleness, this lack of fixity which enables them to widen indefinitely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 534" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 535">The experience of the boat took place in the subtle physical. And the people who had dark patches and who had to be taken back were always the ones who lacked the suppleness needed for these two movements, but especially the movement of widening, more than the movement of progression to follow the Becoming; this seemed to be a preoccupation later, for those who had landed, after the landing. But the preparation on the boat was for this capacity for widening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 536">There was also something else which I did not mention when I described my experience: the boat had no machines. Everything, everything was set in motion by the will — individuals and things — even people’s dress was a result of their will. And this gave a great suppleness to all these things and to the forms of individuals; because one was conscious of this will, which is not a mental will but a will of the Self, or a spiritual will, one might say, a will of the soul, if one gives that meaning to the word soul. But this is something which can be experienced here when one acts with an absolute spontaneity, that is to say, when an action, such as speech or movement, is not determined by the mind — I am not speaking of thought and intellect — not even by the mind which usually makes us act. Usually, when we do something, we perceive within us the will to do this thing —</p>
<span id="page_113"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 113</p>
<p class="PE">when we are conscious and observe ourselves doing it, we can see that; there is always — it may be very fleeting — the will to do it. It is the intervention of the mind, the habitual intervention, the order in which things happen. Whereas the supramental action is decided by overleaping the mind. It is not necessary to pass through the mind, it is direct. Something enters into direct contact with the vital centres and makes them act — without passing through the thought, but with full consciousness. The consciousness does not work in the usual order, it goes directly from the centre of spiritual will to Matter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 537">As long as one can keep this absolute immobility of the mind, the inspiration is absolutely pure, it comes pure. If one can catch it and keep it while speaking, what comes through is also unmixed, it remains pure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 538">It is an extremely delicate working, probably because it is unfamiliar—the least movement, the smallest mental vibration disturbs everything. But as long as it lasts it is perfectly pure. And that must be the <em>constant</em> state of a supramentalised life. The mentalised spiritual will should no longer intervene; because one may very well have a spiritual will, one can live constantly expressing the spiritual will—that is what happens to all those who feel that they are guided by the Divine within—but that comes through a mental transcription. And so long as it is like that, it is not the supramental life. The supramental life <em>no longer</em> passes through the mind. The mind is an immobile zone of transmission. The slightest twitch is enough to disturb it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 539" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 540">One could say that the constant state that is needed for the Supermind to be able to express itself through a terrestrial consciousness is the perfect equality that comes from spiritual identification with the Supreme. Everything becomes the Supreme in a perfect equality. And it is automatic — not the equality achieved by the conscious will, by intellectual effort or</p>
<span id="page_114"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 114</p>
<p class="PE"> an understanding prior to the state; it is not that. It must be spontaneous and automatic; one should no longer respond to everything that comes from outside as if one were responding to something coming from outside. This kind of reflection and response should be replaced by a state of constant perception—which I cannot call identical because each thing necessarily calls for a special response—but free from any rebound, if one may say so. It is the difference that exists between something coming from outside, that strikes you and that you respond to, and something which is circulating and which quite naturally brings with it the vibrations needed for the general action. I do not know whether I am making myself clearly understood.... It is the difference between a vibratory movement circulating in a <em>unitary</em> field of action and a movement coming from something outside, striking from outside and obtaining a response—that is the usual state of human consciousness. On the other hand, when the consciousness is identified with the Supreme, the movements are internal, so to say, in the sense that nothing comes from outside; there are only things that circulate and naturally bring about certain vibrations in the course of their circulation, by similarity and necessity—or that change the vibrations in the medium of circulation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 541">It is something very familiar to me, because it is my constant state at present — I never have the impression of things coming from outside and striking, but of inner, multiple and sometimes contradictory movements, and of a constant circulation bringing about the inner changes needed for the movement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 542">That is the indispensable basis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 543">The widening follows almost automatically, demanding adjustments in the body itself which are difficult to resolve. This is a problem in which I am still completely immersed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 544">And then the suppleness needed to follow the movement of Becoming; suppleness, that is, the capacity for decrystallisation — the whole period of life spent in individualisation is a period of conscious and deliberate crystallisation, which later has to be</p>
<span id="page_115"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 115</p>
<p class="PE">undone. Becoming a conscious and individual being is a constant crystallisation — constant and deliberate — of all things; and afterwards one must make the opposite movement, constantly, and also, even more so, deliberately. At the same time, one must not lose the benefit, in the consciousness, of what one has acquired by individualisation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 545">I must say that it is difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 546">From the point of view of thought it is elementary, very easy. And even from the point of view of feelings, it is not difficult; for the heart, that is, the emotional being, to widen itself to the dimension of the Supreme is relatively easy. But the body! It is very difficult, very difficult without the body losing—how to put it?—it's centre of coagulation; without it dissolving into the surrounding mass. And even then, if one were in the midst of Nature with mountains, forests and rivers, and great natural beauty, plenty of space, it would be rather pleasant! But one cannot take a single step materially, out of one's body, without coming across things that are painful. It occasionally happens that one comes in contact with a substance that is pleasing, harmonious, warm, that vibrates with a higher light. But this is rare. Yes, flowers, sometimes flowers—sometimes, not always. But this material world, oh!... You get knocked everywhere—scratched, scratched, scraped, knocked by all kinds of things that <em>won't unfold</em>. Oh, how difficult it is! How little human life has blossomed! It is shrivelled up, hardened, without light, without warmth—to say nothing of joy.</p>

<p class="PE">absolute necessity for them, so that there can be progress and for the creation to become its Origin once again — and such a clear vision that instead of asking for the conversion or abolition of the adverse forces one must realise one’s own transformation, pray for it and carry it out. This is from the terrestrial point of view, I am not taking the individual standpoint. We know the individual standpoint; this is from the terrestrial point of view. It was the sudden vision of all the error, all the misunderstanding, all the ignorance and obscurity, and even worse, all the bad will in the terrestrial consciousness which felt responsible for the perpetuation of these adverse beings and forces and which offered them in a great aspiration — more than an aspiration, a kind of holocaust — so that the adverse forces might disappear and have no further reason to exist, so that they might no longer be there to point out everything that has to be changed.</p>

All intelligence below is like that; it sees all kinds of things, and as it sees all kinds of things, it cannot choose in order to act. But in order to see the whole target, to see the Truth in its entirety, you must cross over to the other side. And when you cross over to the other side, you do not see a sum of multiple truths nor a countless number of truths added one to another, which you see one after another so that you cannot grasp the whole all at once. When you rise above, it is the whole that you see first; the whole presents itself all at once, in its entirety, in its wholeness, without division. And then you no longer have to make a choice, you have a vision: <em>this</em> is what has to be done. It is not a choice between this and that, or this or that, because it is no longer like that. You no longer see things successively, one after another; you have the simultaneous vision of a whole that exists as a unity. Then the choice is simply a vision.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 585">There are all kinds of premonitory dreams. There are premonitory dreams that are fulfilled immediately, that is to say, you dream in the night what will happen on the next day, and there are premonitory dreams that are fulfilled over varying lengths of time. And according to their position in time, these dreams are seen on various planes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 586">The higher we rise towards absolute certainty, the greater</p>
<span id="page_122"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 122</p>
<p class="PE">the distance is, because these visions belong to a region which is very close to the Origin and the length of time between the revelation of what is going to be and its realisation may be very great. But the revelation is certain, because it is very close to the Origin. There is a place — when one is identified with the Supreme — where one knows everything absolutely, in the past, the present, the future and everywhere. But usually people who go there forget what they have seen when they return. An extremely strict discipline is needed to remember. And that is the only place where one cannot make a mistake.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 587">But the links of the chain of communication are not always all there and one very rarely remembers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 588">To come back to what I was saying, according to the plane on which one has seen, one can more or less judge the time that the vision will take to be fulfilled. And the immediate things are already realised, they already exist in the subtle physical and they can be seen there — they simply are, they exist there. They are only the reflection — not even a transcription — the reflection or projection of the image in the material world which will appear on the next day or in a few hours. There you see the exact thing in all its details, because it already exists; so everything depends on the accuracy of the vision and the power of vision. If you have a power of vision that is objective and sincere, you see the thing accurately; if you add your own feelings and impressions to it, it is coloured by them. So accuracy in the subtle physical depends exclusively on the instrument, that is to say, on the one who sees.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 589">But as soon as you enter a more subtle region, such as the vital — and even more so in the mental, but already in the vital there is a small margin of possibility — then there you can see roughly what is going to happen, but in detail it may be like this or like that; there are wills and influences that may possibly intervene and create a difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 590">And this is because the original Will is reflected, so to say, in the various regions, and each region alters the organisation</p>
<span id="page_123"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 123</p>
<p class="PE">and the relation of the images. The world we live in is a world of images. It is not the thing itself in its essence, it is the reflection of the thing. One could say that we are, in our material existence, only a reflection, an image of what we are in our essential reality. And the modalities of these reflections bring in every error and falsification — what you see in the essence is perfectly true and pure and exists from all eternity; the images are essentially variable. And according to the degree of falsehood that enters into the vibrations, the degree of distortion and alteration increases. One could say that every circumstance, every event, every thing has a pure existence, which is the true existence, and a considerable number of impure or distorted existences, which are the existence of the same thing in the various domains of being. For example, in the intellectual domain, there is already a good deal of distortion; in the mental domain there is a considerable amount of distortion, and as all the emotional and sensorial domains come in, the distortions increase. And once you reach the material plane, it is most often unrecognisable. It is completely distorted — so much so that it is sometimes very difficult to know that this is the material expression of that — they are no longer very much alike.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 591">It is a rather novel way of approaching the problem and it may be the key to many things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 592">Thus when you know someone well and you often see him physically, if you see him in the subtle physical, already there are things which become more marked, more visible, more outstanding, which you had not seen physically, because in the greyness of the material world they had merged with many other things on the same plane. There are characteristics or expressions of character which become outstanding enough to be quite visible, although they had not been physically apparent. When you look at a person physically, there is the complexion, the features, the expression; at the same moment, if you see this face in the subtle physical, you suddenly notice that one part of the face is one</p>
<span id="page_124"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 124</p>
<p class="PE">colour, another part another colour; that in the eyes there is an expression and a kind of light which were not at all visible; and that the whole has quite a different appearance and, above all, gives a very different feeling, which to our physical eyes would seem rather extravagant, but which to the subtle vision is very expressive and revealing of the character, or even of the influences acting on this person. What I say here is the record of an experience that I had again a few days ago.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 593">So according to the degree to which you are conscious and the extent to which you see, you perceive images, see events that are more or less near, and you see them more or less accurately. The only vision that is true and sure is the vision of the divine Consciousness. So the problem is to become aware of the divine Consciousness and to keep this consciousness in all details all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 594">Until then, there are all sorts of ways of receiving indications. The precise, accurate, familiar vision that certain people have may come from several sources. It may be a vision by identity with circumstances and things, when you are used to extending your consciousness all around you. It may be an indication given by a talkative being from the invisible world who amuses himself by informing you of what is going to happen; this happens very often. Then everything depends on the moral character of your “informant”; if he is amusing himself at your expense, he tells you all kinds of tales — and this is what happens most of the time to people who get information from entities. To lure people on, they may very often tell them things as they really will be, since they have a universal vision in some domain of the vital or of the mind; and then when they are quite sure that you will trust them, they may start telling you tales and you make a fool of yourself. This happens very often. You yourself should be in a higher state of consciousness than these individuals or entities or these little gods, as some people call them, and be able to verify from above what their statements are worth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 595">If you have a universal mental vision, you can see all mental</p>
<span id="page_125"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 125</p>
<p class="PE"> formations. Then you see—and it is very interesting—how the mental world is organised to realise itself on the physical plane. You see the various formations, the way in which they approach and fight each other, combine together and organise themselves, the ones that prevail and gain influence and achieve a more complete realisation. Now if you really want to have a higher vision, you must rise above the mental world and see the original wills as they descend to express themselves. In this case, you may not possess all the details, but the central <em>fact</em>, the fact in its central truth, is indisputable, undeniable, absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 596">Some people also have the power to predict things which already exist on earth, but at a distance, at a great distance, very far from the physical eyes. These are usually people who are capable of widening and extending their consciousness. They have a physical, but slightly more subtle vision, which depends on an organ that is more subtle than the purely material one — what might be called the life of this organ — and so, by projecting their consciousness with a will to see, they can see very well, they can see things: these things already exist, only they are not within the field of our ordinary vision. People who have this capacity and who tell what they see, who are sincere and who are not bluffers, see in a way that is absolutely precise and exact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 597">In fact, an important factor for those who predict or see, is their absolute sincerity. Unfortunately, because of people’s curiosity, their insistence, the pressure they apply — which very few can resist — what happens, when there is something they do not see exactly and precisely, is that there is an almost involuntary faculty of inner imagination, which adds the little missing element. This is what causes the flaws in their predictions. Very few have the courage to say, “Oh no, I do not know about that, it eludes me.” They do not even have the courage to say it to themselves. And then, just a touch of imagination, acting almost subconsciously, and they fill in the vision, the information — anything can happen. Very few people can resist that. I have known many, many clairvoyants, I have known many people</p>
<span id="page_126"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 126</p>
<p class="PE">who had a marvellous gift; very few of them would stop when they come to the end of their knowledge. Or else they would add some little detail. This is what always gives these faculties a rather doubtful quality. One must truly be a saint — a great saint, a great sage — and completely free, not at all influenced by other people. Naturally, I am not speaking of those who seek fame, because there they fall into the crudest traps; but even goodwill, the wish to make people happy, to please them, to help them, is enough to create a distortion.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>When events are already prepared in the subtle physical and you have a vision of them, is it too late to change things? Can one still act?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 598">I know of a very interesting example. There was a time when in the newspaper <em>Le Matin</em>—it was a long time ago, you must have been very young—every day there was a little cartoon of a boy pointing to something—a kind of page-boy dressed like that—and always showing the date or something—a little cartoon. Now the gentleman in this story was travelling and he was staying in a big hotel, I do not remember in which town, and one night or early in the morning, very early, he had a dream. He saw this page-boy pointing to his funeral carriage—you know, when they take people to the cemetery, in Europe—and inviting him to step into it! He saw that and then in the morning when he was ready, he left his room which was on the top floor, and there, on the landing, the same boy, dressed in the same way, was pointing out the lift for him to go down. That gave him a shock. He refused and said, "No thank you." The lift fell and crashed, killing the people inside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 599">He told me that after that he believed in dreams.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 600">It was a vision. He saw the boy, but instead of the lift, the boy was showing him his hearse. So when he saw the same gesture, the same boy — like the cartoon, you see — he said, “No thank you, I’ll walk down”, and the machine — it was one of those</p>
<span id="page_127"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 127</p>
<p class="PE">hydraulic lifts — broke and fell. It was right at the top. It was crushed to a pulp.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 601">My explanation is that an entity had forewarned him. The image of the page-boy seems to indicate that an intelligence, a consciousness had intervened; it does not seem to have been his own subconscient. Or it might be that his subconscient was aware and had seen in the subtle physical that this was going to happen. But why did his subconscient give him an image like that? I do not know. Perhaps something in the subconscient knew, because it was already there, it was already in the subtle physical. The accident already existed before it happened — the law of the accident.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 602">Obviously, there is always, in every case, some difference, sometimes a few hours — but that is the maximum — sometimes a few seconds. And very often, things tell you that they are there, and it takes them sometimes a few minutes, sometimes a few seconds to come into contact with your consciousness. Constantly, constantly I know what is going to happen, and for things that are of absolutely no interest — there is no advantage in knowing it beforehand, it changes nothing; but it exists, it is all around you. If your consciousness is wide enough, you know all that, for example, that a certain person is going to bring you a parcel, things like that. And it is like that every day. Or that a certain person is about to arrive. It is because the consciousness is extended, so it contacts things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 603">But in that case we cannot say that it is a premonition, for it already exists, only the contact with our senses takes a few seconds to be realised, because there is a door or a wall or something that prevents us from seeing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 604">But several times I have had experiences like this. For example, once when I was walking in the mountains, I was on a path where there was only room for one — on one side the precipice, on the other sheer rock. There were three children behind me and a fourth person bringing up the rear. I was leading. The path ran along the edge of the rock; we could</p>
<span id="page_128"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 128</p>
<p class="PE">not see where we were going — and besides, it was very dangerous; if anyone had slipped, he would have been over the edge. I was walking in front when suddenly I saw, with other eyes than these — although I was watching my steps carefully — I saw a snake, there, on the rock, waiting on the other side. Then I took one step, gently, and indeed on the other side there was a snake. That spared me the shock of surprise, because I had seen and I was advancing cautiously; and as there was no shock of surprise, I was able to tell the children without giving them a shock, “Stop, keep quiet, don’t stir.” If there had been a shock, something might have happened. The snake had heard a noise, it was already coiled and on the defensive in front of its hole, with its head swaying — it was a viper. This was in France. Nothing happened, whereas if there had been any confusion or commotion, anything could have happened.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 605">This kind of thing has happened to me very, very often — with snakes it happened to me four times. Once, it was completely dark, here, near the fishing village of Ariankuppam. There was a river and it happened just at the place where it flows into the sea. It was dark — the night had fallen very quickly. We were walking along the road and just as I was about to put my foot down — I had already lifted my foot and I was going to put it down — I distinctly heard a voice in my ear: “Be careful!” And yet nobody had spoken. So I looked and saw, just as my foot was about to touch the ground, an enormous black cobra, which I would have comfortably stepped on — those people don’t like that. He streaked away and across the water — what a beauty, my child! His hood open, head erect above the water, he went across like a king. Obviously, I would have been punished for my impertinence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 606">I have had hundreds and hundreds of experiences like that; at the very last moment, not a second too soon, I was informed. And in the most varied circumstances. Once, in Paris, I was crossing the Boulevard Saint Michel. It was during the last</p>
<span id="page_129"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 129</p>
<p class="PE">weeks; I had decided that within a certain number of months I would achieve union with the psychic Presence, the inner Divine, and I no longer had any other thought, any other concern. I lived near the Luxembourg Gardens and every evening I used to walk there — but always deeply absorbed within. There is a kind of intersection there, and it is not a place to cross when one is deeply absorbed within; it was not very sensible. And so I was like that, I was walking, when I suddenly received a shock, as if I had received a blow, as if something had hit me, and I jumped back instinctively. And as soon as I had jumped back, a tram went past — it was the tram that I had felt at a little more than arm’s length. It had touched the aura, the aura of protection — it was very strong at that time, I was deeply immersed in occultism and I knew how to keep it — the aura of protection had been hit and that had literally thrown me backwards, as if I had received a physical shock. And what insults from the driver! I jumped back just in time and the tram went by.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 607">The protection may come from many different sources. Very often it was someone who informed me: a little entity, or some kind of being; sometimes it was the aura that protected me. And it was for all kinds of things. That is to say, life was seldom limited to the physical body—this is convenient, this is good. It is necessary, it increases your capacities. This is what the person who taught me occultism told me straightaway: "You are depriving yourself of senses which are most useful <em>even for the most ordinary life</em>." And this is true, quite true. We can know infinitely more things than we usually do, simply by using our own senses. And not only from the mental point of view, but also from the vital and even the physical point of view.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>But what is the method?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 608">Oh, the method is very easy. There are disciplines. It depends on what you want to do.</p>
<span id="page_130"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 130</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 609">It depends. For each thing there is a method. And the first method is to want it, to begin with, that is, to take a decision. Then you are given a description of all these senses and how they work — that takes some time. You take one sense or several, or the one which is easiest for you to start with, and you decide. Then you follow the discipline. It is the equivalent of exercises for developing the muscles. You can even succeed in creating a will in yourself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 610">But for more subtle things, the method is to make for yourself an exact image of what you want, to come into contact with the corresponding vibration, and then to concentrate and do exercises — such as to practise seeing through an object or hearing through a sound,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130-4" href="#">4</a> or seeing at a distance. For example, once, for a long time, for several months, I was confined to bed and I found it rather boring — I wanted to see. I was in a room and at one end there was another little room and at the end of the little room there was a kind of bridge; in the middle of the garden the bridge became a staircase leading down into a very big and very beautiful studio, standing in the middle of the garden. I wanted to go and see what was happening in the studio, for I was feeling bored in my room. So I would remain very quiet, close my eyes and send out my consciousness, little by little, little by little, little by little. And day after day — I chose a fixed time and did the exercise regularly. At first you make use of your imagination and then it becomes a fact. After some time I really had the physical sensation that my vision was moving; I followed it and then I could see things downstairs which I knew nothing about. I would check afterwards. In the evening I would ask, “Was this like that? And was that like this?”</p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-130-4"><sup>4</sup> Mother explained later: “To hear behind the sound is to come into contact with the subtle reality which is behind the material fact, behind the word or the physical sound or behind music, for example. One concentrates and then one hears what is behind. It means coming into contact with the vital reality which is behind the appearances. There can also be a mental reality, but generally, what lies immediately behind the physical sound is a vital reality.”</p>
</div>
<span id="page_131"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 131</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 611">But for each one of these things you must practise for months with patience, with a kind of obstinacy. You take the senses one by one, hearing, sight, and you can even arrive at subtle realities of taste, smell and touch.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 612">From the mental point of view it is easier, for there you are accustomed to concentration. When you want to think and find a solution, instead of following the deductions of thought, you stop everything and try to concentrate and concentrate, intensify the point of the problem. You stop everything and wait until, by the intensity of the concentration, you obtain an answer. This also requires some time. But if you used to be a good student, you must be quite used to doing that and it is not very difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 613">There is a kind of extension of the physical senses. Red Indians, for example, possess a sense of hearing and smell with a far greater range than our own — and dogs! I knew an Indian — he was my friend when I was eight or ten years old. He had come with Buffalo Bill, at the time of the Hippodrome — it was a long time ago, I was eight years old — and he would put his ear to the ground and was so clever that he knew how far away... according to the intensity of the vibration, he knew how far away someone’s footsteps were. After that, the children would immediately say, “I wish I knew how to do that!”</p>

But with the two experiences I have had — the experience of external life, with universalisation, impersonalisation, in short, all the yogic experiences one can have in the physical body, and on the other hand the experience of total and perfect union with the Origin — now that I have had these two experiences and that something has happened, which I cannot describe yet, I know that the knowledge of the two and the union of the two is not enough; that they lead to a third thing and it is this third thing which is in the making, in course of elaboration.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 672">Sri Aurobindo is speaking here of knowledge by inspiration or revelation, when something suddenly descends and illumines the understanding. You suddenly have the impression that you know something for the first time, because it comes directly from the domain of Light, of true Knowledge, and it comes with all its innate power of truth — it illumines you. And when you have just received it, it seems indeed that nothing can resist that Light. And if you take care to allow it to act within you, it accomplishes all the transformation it can achieve in its own domain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 673">This is an experience one may often have. When it comes, for some time — not very long — everything seems to organise itself quite naturally around that Light. And then, little by little, it mingles with the rest; the intellectual knowledge remains — it is formulated in one way or another — it remains, but it is just as if it were empty. It no longer has that driving power which transforms all the movements of the being into the image of this Light. That is what Sri Aurobindo means: the world moves quickly, the Lord is always moving onward and all this is the trail He leaves behind Him, but it no longer has the same immediate and almighty power as when He projected it into the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 674">It feels like a rain of truth falling; everyone who can catch even a drop of it receives a revelation.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 685">This kind of revelation can only occur in a silent mind — at least in a mind that is at rest, completely quiet and still, otherwise they do not come.

This feeling of something so still — but not closed, still but open, still but receptive — is something which becomes established through repeated experiences. There is a great difference between a silence that is dead, dull, unresponsive and the receptive silence of a quietened mind. That makes a great difference.

Like this, the explanation becomes easy: He objectifies Himself gradually, progressively, and this results in a progressive evolution. But that is only a manner of speaking; because there is no beginning, there is no end, and yet there is a progression. The sense of succession, the sense of evolution, the sense of progress only exists with the manifestation. It is only when one speaks of the earth that one can give an explanation that is both very rational and in accord with the facts, because the earth has a beginning, not in its soul but in its material reality.</p>

And for the earth, this reduces the problem to something very understandable — a miracle is the sudden intrusion of something which did not belong to the earth: it produces a radical and immediate change by introducing a principle which did not belong to this physical world of earth.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 795">If, instead of a slow evolution, something belonging to the supra-mental world appeared suddenly, man, the mental being, could call that a miracle, because it would be the intervention of something which he does not consciously carry within himself and which intervenes in his conscious life. And in fact, if you consider this taste for miracles, which is very strong — much stronger in children and in hearts that have remained childlike than in highly mentalised individuals — it is a faith in the realisation of the aspiration for the marvellous, of something higher than anything one can expect from normal life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 796">Indeed, in education, both tendencies should be encouraged side by side: the tendency to thirst for the marvellous, for what seems unrealisable, for something which fills you with the feeling of divinity; while at the same time encouraging exact, correct, sincere observation in the perception of the world as it is, the suppression of all imagination, a constant control, a highly practical and meticulous sense for exact details. Both should go side by side. Usually, you kill the one with the idea that this is necessary in order to foster the other — this is completely wrong. Both can be simultaneous and there comes a time when one has enough knowledge to know that they are the two aspects of the same thing: insight, a higher discernment. But instead of a narrow, limited insight and discernment, the</p>
<span id="page_161"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 161</p>
<p class="PE">discernment becomes entirely sincere, correct, exact, but it is vast, it includes a whole domain that does not yet belong to the concrete manifestation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 797">From the point of view of education, this would be very important: to see the world as it is, exactly, unadorned, in the most down-to-earth and concrete manner; and to see the world as it can be, with the freest, highest vision, the one most full of hope and aspiration and marvellous certitude — as the two poles of discernment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 798">The most splendid, most marvellous, most powerful, most expressive, most total things we can imagine are nothing compared to what they can be; and at the same time our meticulous exactitude in the tiniest detail is never exact enough.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 799">And this is the best possible use of the need for miracles. The need for miracles is a gesture of ignorance: “Oh, I would like things to be like this!” It is a gesture of ignorance and impotence. And those who say, “You live in a miracle”, know only the lower end — and even then they know it only imperfectly — and they have no contact with anything else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 800">This need for miracles must be changed into a conscious aspiration for something—which is already there, which exists—which will be manifested <em>by the help</em> of all these aspirations; all these aspirations are necessary or, if one looks at it in a truer way, they are an accompaniment—an agreeable accompaniment—in the eternal unfolding.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 801">Of course, people with a very strict logic tell you, “Why pray? Why aspire? Why ask?

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 811">It is the same idea, that is, opposition and contraries are a stimulus to progress. Because to say that without cruelty Love would be tepid... The principle of Love as it exists beyond the Manifested and the Non-Manifested has nothing to do with either tepidness or cruelty. Only, Sri Aurobindo’s idea would seem to be that opposites are the quickest and most effective means of shaping Matter so that it can intensify its manifestation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 812">As an experience, this is absolutely certain, in the sense that, first of all, when one comes into contact with eternal Love, the supreme Love, one immediately has—how to put it?—a perception, a sensation—it is not an understanding, it is something very concrete: even the most illumined material consciousness, however much it has been moulded and prepared, is <em>incapable</em> of manifesting That. The first thing one feels is this kind of incapacity. Then comes an experience: something which manifests a form of—one cannot call it exactly cruelty, because it is not "cruelty" as we know it—but within the totality of circumstances, a vibration appears and, with a certain intensity, refuses love as it is manifested here. It is precisely this: something in the material world which refuses the manifestation of love as it exists at present. I am not speaking of the ordinary world, I am speaking of the present consciousness at its highest. It is an experience, I am speaking of something that has happened. So the part of the consciousness which has been struck by this opposition makes a direct appeal to the origin of Love, <em>with an intensity which it would not have without the experience of this refusal</em>. Limits are broken and a flood pours down which <em>could not</em> have manifested before; and something is expressed which was not expressed before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 813">When one sees this, there is obviously a similar experience from the point of view of what we call life and death. It is this kind of constant “brooding” or presence of Death and the</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 164</p>
<p class="PE"> possibility of death, as it is said in <em>Savitri</em>: we have a constant companion throughout the journey from cradle to grave; we are constantly accompanied by this threat or presence of Death. Well, along with this, in the cells, there is a call for a Power of Eternity, with an intensity which would not be there except for this constant threat. Then one understands, one begins to feel quite concretely that all these things are only ways of intensifying the manifestation, of making it progress, of making it more perfect. And if the means are crude, it is because the manifestation itself is very crude. And as it becomes more perfect and fit to manifest that which is <em>eternally progressive</em>, the very crude means will give way to subtler ones and the world will progress without any need for such brutal oppositions. This is simply because the world is still in its infancy and human consciousness is still entirely in its infancy.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 834">It is true that doctors have said that if one can teach the body to bear pain, it becomes more and more resilient and less easily disrupted — this is a concrete result. In the case of people who know how to avoid getting completely upset as soon as they have a pain somewhere, who are able to bear it quietly, to keep their balance, it seems that the body’s capacity to bear the disorder without going to pieces increases. This is a great achievement. I have asked myself this question from the purely practical, external standpoint and it seems to be like this. Inwardly, I have been told this many times — told and shown by small experiences — that the body can bear much more than we think, if no fear or anxiety is added to the pain. If we eliminate the mental factor, the body, left to itself, has neither fear nor apprehension nor anxiety about what is going to happen — no anguish — and it can bear a great deal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 835">The second step is when the body has decided to bear it — you see, it takes the decision to bear it: immediately, the acuteness, what is acute in the pain disappears. I am speaking absolutely materially.</p>

Some renounce for the joy of duty done, some for the joy of peace, some for the joy of God and some for the joy of self-torture, but renounce rather as a passage to the freedom and untroubled rapture beyond.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 840">I have rarely had this experience of renunciation — for there to be renunciation, one must be attached to things, and there was always this thirst, this need to go further, to go higher, to feel better, to do better, to have something better. And rather than having a feeling of renunciation one has the feeling that it is a good riddance — you get rid of something cumbersome that weighs you down and hinders your advance. That is what I was saying the other day: we are still everything we no longer want to be and He is everything we want to become — what we call “we” in our egoistic stupidity is precisely what we do not want to be any more, and we would be so happy to throw all that off, to get rid of all that, so as to be able to be what we want to be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 841">This is a very living experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 842">The only process that I have known, and which has been repeated several times during my life, is the renunciation of an error: something you believe to be true — which probably was true for a time — on which you base part of your action, but which in fact was only an opinion. You thought that it was a</p>
<span id="page_169"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 169</p>
<p class="PE">true evaluation with all its logical consequences, and your action — part of your action — was based on that, and it all followed automatically; and suddenly, an experience, a circumstance or an intuition, warns you that your evaluation is not as true as it looked. Then there is a whole period of observation, of study — or sometimes it comes like a revelation, a massive demonstration — and not only the idea or the false knowledge, but all its consequences must be changed — perhaps a whole way of acting on some point. And at that moment there is a kind of sensation, something akin to the sensation of renunciation, which means that you must break up a whole set of things which had been built — sometimes it can be quite extensive, sometimes it is something very small, but the experience is the same: it is the movement of a force, a power that dissolves, and there is resistance from everything which has to be dissolved, from all the past habits; and it is this movement of dissolution, with its corresponding resistance, which is probably expressed in the ordinary human consciousness as a feeling of renunciation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 843">I saw this very recently — it is insignificant, these circumstances have no importance in themselves; they are interesting only in the context of the study. This is the only phenomenon that is familiar to me because it has been repeated several times in my life. As the being progresses, the power of dissolution increases, becomes more and more immediate and the resistance diminishes. But I have the memory of a period of maximum resistance — it was more than half a century ago — and it was nothing but that, it was always something outside myself — not outside my consciousness, but outside my will — something which resisted the will. I have never had the feeling of having to renounce anything, but I have had the feeling of having to apply pressure on things to dissolve them. Whereas now, more and more, the pressure is imperceptible, it is immediate; as soon as the force to dissolve a whole set of things manifests, there is no resistance, everything dissolves; on the contrary, there is</p>
<span id="page_170"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 170</p>
<p class="PE">hardly any feeling of liberation — there is something which is amused again and says: “Oh, again! How many times one limits oneself....” How many times you think that you are advancing, continuously, smoothly, uninterruptedly, and yet how many times you set a little limit in front of yourself. It is not a big limit, for it is a very small thing in an immense whole, but it is a small limit to your action. And so when the Force acts to dissolve the limit, at first you feel liberated, you are glad; but now, it is not even that, it is a smile. Because it is not a feeling of liberation, it is simply like removing a stone from your path so that you can go on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 844">This idea of renunciation can only arise in a self-centred consciousness. Naturally, people—the ones I call altogether primitive—are attached to things: when they have something, they do not want to let it go! It seems so childish to me!... When they have to part with something, it hurts! Because they identify themselves with the things they have. But this is childishness. The true process behind all this is the amount of resistance in things that were formed on a certain basis of knowledge—which was a knowledge at a particular time and which is no longer so at another—a partial knowledge, not fleeting but impermanent. There is a whole set of things built upon this knowledge and they resist the force that says: "No! it is not true, (<em>laughing</em>) your basis is no longer true, let's take it away!" And then, oh! it hurts—this is what people experience as renunciation.</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 171</p>
<p class="PE">consciousness and the union with the Divine that bring rapture — this is the principle — therefore, the consciousness and the union with the Divine, whether in the world as it is or in the construction of a future world, must be the same — in principle. That is what I repeat to myself all the time: “How is it that you do not have this rapture?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 847">I have it—when the whole consciousness is centralised in union; at any time, in the midst of anything, with this movement of concentration of the consciousness on union, the rapture comes. But I must say that it disappears when I am working.... It is a world—a very chaotic world of work, where I act on everything around me; and necessarily, I am obliged to receive what is around me, so as to be able to act on it. I have reached a state in which all that I receive, even the things that are considered most painful, leave me absolutely calm and indifferent—"indifferent," not an inactive indifference: without any painful reaction of any kind, absolutely neutral (<em>gesture turned towards the Eternal</em>), with perfect equality. But in this equality there is a precise knowledge of what is to be done, of what is to be said, of what is to be written, of what is to be decided, in short, everything that action entails. All that happens in a state of perfect neutrality, with the sense of Power at the same time: the Power flows, the Power acts, and the neutrality remains—but there is no rapture. I do not have the enthusiasm, the delight, the fullness of action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 848">And I must say that this rapturous state of consciousness would be dangerous in the present condition of the world. Because it produces reactions that are almost absolute—I see that this state of rapture has a <em>formidable</em> power. But I insist on the word formidable, in the sense that it is intolerant or intolerable—intolerable rather—to everything that is unlike it. It is the same thing or almost—not quite the same, but almost—as the supreme divine Love; the vibration of this ecstasy or rapture is a small beginning of the vibration of divine Love, and that is absolutely—yes, there is no other word for it—intolerant, in</p>

<p class="PE">the sense that it will not permit the presence of anything that is contrary to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 849">So it would have frightful consequences for the ordinary consciousness. I see it clearly, because sometimes this Power comes—this Power comes and one has the impression that everything is going to explode. For it can tolerate nothing but union, it can tolerate nothing but the response that accepts, that receives and accepts. And it is not an arbitrary will, it is by the <em>very fact</em> of its existence which is All-Power, "All-Power" not in the sense in which we understand it, but really All-Power. That is to say that it exists entirely, totally, exclusively. It contains everything, but anything that is contrary to its vibration is compelled to change, since nothing can disappear. So this immediate, almost brutal, absolute change, in the world as it is, is a catastrophe.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 854">It is impossible to satisfy desire perfectly — it is something impossible. And also to renounce desire. You renounce one desire and you have another. Therefore both are relatively impossible; what is possible is to enter into a state where there is no desire.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 856">It is a pity that I cannot note down all these experiences that come, because these last few days and during a whole period, there has been a very clear perception of the true working which is the expression of the supreme Will translated spontaneously, naturally, automatically through the individual instrument; one might even say—for the mind is quiet, it keeps quiet—through the body; and the perception of the moment when this expression of the divine Will is clouded—distorted—by the introduction of desire, the special vibration of desire, which has a quality all its own and which has many apparent causes: it is not only the thirst for something, the need for something, or the attachment to something; the same vibration can be set in motion, for example, by the fact that the will which is expressed seems to be, or at least is mistaken for, the expression of the supreme Will; but there has been a confusion between the immediate action which was obviously the expression of the supreme Will and the result which should have followed—it is a mistake we very often make. We are in the habit of thinking that when we want something it should come to us, because the vision is too shortsighted—too shortsighted and too limited; instead of having an overall vision which would show us that this particular vibration was necessary to set off a certain number of other vibrations and that it is the <em>totality</em> of all that which will have an effect, which is not the immediate effect of the vibration emitted. I do not know if this is clear, but it is a constant experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 857">As a matter of fact, during this period, I have studied and observed this phenomenon: how the vibration of desire is added to the vibration of Will emitted by the Supreme — in our little everyday actions. And with the vision from above, if we take care to maintain the consciousness of this vision from above, we can see how this vibration emitted was exactly the vibration emitted by the Supreme, but instead of obtaining the immediate result expected by the surface consciousness, it was meant to set off a</p>
<span id="page_174"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 174</p>
<p class="PE">whole series of vibrations and to achieve another, more distant and more complete result. I am not speaking of great things or of actions on a terrestrial scale, I am speaking of the very small things in life: for example, saying to someone,“Give me this”, and instead of giving it, that someone does not understand and gives something else. So if we do not take care to preserve an overall vision, a certain vibration may occur, for example a vibration of impatience or of dissatisfaction, together with the impression that the vibration from the Lord is not understood and not received. Well, this little added vibration of impatience or, in fact, of not understanding what is happening, this impression of a lack of receptivity or response, is of the same quality as desire — it cannot be called a desire, but it is the same kind of vibration — this is what comes to complicate things. If we have the complete, exact vision, we know that “Give me this” will produce something other than the immediate result and that this other thing will bring in something else which is exactly what should be. I do not know if I am making myself clear, it is rather complicated! But this gave me the key to the difference in quality between the vibration of Will and the vibration of desire, and at the same time the possibility of eliminating this vibration of desire by a wider and more total vision — wider, more total and far-seeing, that is to say, the vision of a greater whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 858">I insist on this point, because this eliminates all moral factors. It eliminates this pejorative notion of desire. More and more, the vision is eliminating all notions of good and bad, right and wrong, inferior and superior, and all that. There is only what might almost be called a difference of vibratory quality — “quality” still gives the idea of superiority and inferiority; it is not quality, it is not intensity. I do not know the scientific term they use to distinguish one vibration from another, but that’s what it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 859">And so what is noteworthy is that the vibration, what one might call the quality of the vibration that comes from the Lord, is constructive — it builds and it is peaceful and luminous; while</p>
<span id="page_175"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 175</p>
<p class="PE">the other vibration of desire, or any similar vibration, complicates, destroys, confuses and twists things — confuses and distorts them, twists them. And this takes away the light; it produces a greyness, which can be intensified by violent movements into very dark shadows. But even when there is no passion, when passion does not intervene, it is like that. The physical reality has become nothing but a field of vibrations that mingle and unfortunately also clash and conflict with one another; and the clash, the conflict is a climax of this kind of turmoil and disorder and confusion created by certain vibrations which are in fact vibrations of ignorance — because we do not know. They are vibrations of ignorance and they are too small, too narrow, too limited — too short. The problem is no longer perceived from a psychological point of view at all; there are only vibrations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 860">If we consider it from the psychological point of view... on the mental plane, it is very easy; on the vital plane it is not very difficult; on the physical plane it is a little heavier, for it takes the form of “needs”; but here too there has been a field of experience these last few days: the study of medical and scientific conceptions of the structure of the body, its needs, what is good or bad for it; and that, reduced to its essence, comes down to the same question of vibrations. It was rather interesting: there was an appearance — for all things as they are seen by the ordinary consciousness are pure appearances — there was an appearance of food-poisoning and it became the object of a special study in order to find out whether there was anything absolute in it or whether the poisoning was relative, that is, based on ignorance and a bad reaction, and on the absence of the true vibration. The conclusion was that it is a question of proportion between the amount, the sum of vibrations that belong to the Lord, and the vibrations that still belong to obscurity; and, depending on the proportion, it takes the form of something concrete and real or of something that can be eliminated, that is, which does not resist the influence of the vibration of Truth. And it was very interesting, for as soon as the consciousness was informed</p>
<span id="page_176"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 176</p>
<p class="PE">of the cause of the disturbance in the functioning of the body — the consciousness saw where it came from, what it was — immediately, the observation began with the idea, “Let us see what is happening.” First, put the body in a state of perfect rest with the certitude — which is always there — that nothing happens except by the will of the Lord, that the result is also the will of the Lord, and that therefore one should be completely quiet; so the body is completely quiet, untroubled, it is not restless, not vibrating, nothing — completely quiet. And then, to what extent are the effects inevitable? As a certain amount of matter containing an element unfavourable to the elements of the body and to the life of the body has been absorbed, what is the proportion of favourable and unfavourable elements, or of favourable and unfavourable vibrations? Then I saw very clearly that the proportion varies according to the number of body cells under the direct influence, which respond only to the supreme vibration, and the others which still belong to the ordinary way of vibrating. It was very clear, because one could see all the possibilities, from the ordinary mass which is completely upset by this intrusion and in which one has to fight with all the ordinary methods to get rid of the undesirable element, to the total response of the cells to the supreme Force, which means that the intrusion can have no effect. But this is still the dream of tomorrow — we are on the way. And the proportion has become quite favourable — I cannot say all-powerful, far from it — quite favourable, which means that the consequences of the disturbance did not last very long and the damage was, so to say, minimal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 861">But all the experiences at the moment, one after the other—all the <em>physical</em> experiences of the body—lead to the same conclusion: everything depends on the proportion of elements responding exclusively to the influence of the Supreme, the elements that are half and half, on the way to transformation, and the elements that are still in the old process of vibration of Matter. Their number seems to be diminishing; it seems to</p>
<span id="page_177"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 177</p>
<p class="PE">be diminishing greatly, but there are still enough of them to produce unpleasant effects or reactions — things that are not transformed, that still belong to ordinary life. But every problem — whether psychological or purely material or chemical — the whole problem comes down to this: they are nothing but vibrations. And there is the perception of this totality of vibrations and the perception of what one might call, very crudely and approximately, the difference between constructive and destructive vibrations. We could say — it is simply a way of putting it — that all vibrations that come from the One and express Oneness are constructive and that all the complications of the ordinary separative consciousness lead to destruction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 862" style="text-align:center">(<em>Long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 863">It is always said that it is desire which creates difficulties, and indeed it is like that. Desire may simply be something added to the vibration of will. The Will—when it is the one Will, the supreme Will expressing itself—is direct, immediate, there are no possible obstacles; and so everything that delays, hinders, causes complication or even failure is <em>necessarily</em> an admixture of desire.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 864">One can see it in everything. For example, take an external field of action, with the external world, external things—of course, to say that it is "external" is simply to put oneself in a false position—but, for example, from the higher consciousness, the Truth-consciousness, you tell someone, "Go",—I giving one example among millions—"Go and see this person and tell him this in order to obtain that." If this person is receptive, immobile within and surrendered, then he goes, he sees the person and tells him and the thing is done—without <em>any</em> complication whatever, like that. If this person has an active mental consciousness, if he does not have total faith, if he has all the mixture of everything brought in by ego and ignorance,</p>
<span id="page_178"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 178</p>
<p class="PE">he sees difficulties, he sees problems to be solved, he sees all the complications — and of course, all this happens. And so according to the proportion — everything is always a question of proportion — according to the proportion, it creates complications, it takes time, the thing is delayed or even worse, it is distorted, it does not happen exactly as it should, it is changed, diminished, distorted or in the end it is not done at all — there are many, many degrees, but all that belongs to the domain of complications — mental complications — and desire. Whereas the other way is immediate. There are countless examples of these cases — of all cases — and also of the “immediate case”. Then people tell you: “Oh, you have performed a miracle!” — no miracle has been performed: that is how it should always be. It is because the intermediary did not add himself to the action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 865">I do not know if this is clear, but anyway...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 866">So this ranges from the smallest thing to an action on the terrestrial scale. There are examples, in terrestrial action, of things that have been done in this way — if there is a good intermediary. Nobody understood how it was done, why it was done — like that, very, very simply, everything turned out well. And in other cases, to get a visa or a permit one has to move mountains. So, from the smallest thing, the smallest physical indisposition to a worldwide action, it is all the same principle, everything comes to the same principle.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 883">You have a wordless, thoughtless experience of a kind of vibration which gives you a feeling of absolute truth and then, if you remain very still, without seeking to know anything, after some time it is as if the vibration were passing through a filter and it is translated as a kind of idea.

And it spins round and round (<em>gesture above the head</em>), it churns and churns; then there is the impression of an idea—but the idea is lower, it is like a covering; the idea contains its own sensation, it also brings a sensation the—sensation was there before, but without the idea, and so the sensation could not be defined. There is only one thing, it is always an explosion of luminous Power. And then, afterwards, if you look at it and remain very quiet—the head, especially, should keep quiet—everything becomes silent (<em>motionless, upward gesture</em>), then suddenly someone speaks inside the head—someone speaks. It is this explosion speaking. Then I take a pencil and paper and I write. But between what speaks and what writes there is still a little space to be crossed, so that when it is written down something up there is not satisfied.

But there is something, something that makes you smile, that is pleasant, like a sparkling wine, and here (<em>Mother indicates a word or a passage in an imaginary note</em>), here it is dull. Then you look with your knowledge of the language, or with your sense of word-rhythm: "Look, there's a pebble." You must remove the pebble; and then you wait and suddenly it comes, plop! it falls into place: the right word. If you are patient, after a day or two, it becomes absolutely accurate.</p>

One can have a feeling of differentiation: not that it is not oneself, but it is a different vision. I have told you, everything one can say is nothing, it is nonsense, because words are meant to express the unreal world, but... Yes, perhaps this is what Sri Aurobindo calls the sense of multiplicity in unity, it may correspond a little; just as one feels the inner multiplicity of one's being, something like that... I no longer have the feeling of a separate self, not at all, not at all, even in the body, but that does not prevent me from having a certain sense of objective relation—yes, look—this is the same thing as his "relation of consciousness" between earth and sun, which changes (<em>Mother laughs</em>). It is true that this is perhaps the best way of saying it! It is a relation of consciousness. It is not at all a relation of self and "others"—not at all, that is completely cancelled—but it might be like a relation of consciousness between the different parts of one's being.

Therefore it may remain as it is in its appearance for a very long time, even if its understanding and receptivity are exceptional. I mean that the awareness, the conscious perception of this body is infinitely superior to the awareness of all the others with which it is in contact, except at those moments—the moments—when other bodies, as if by Grace, have this perception; whereas for this body, it is a natural and constant state. It is the effective result of the fact that this Truth-Consciousness is more constantly concentrated on this group of cells than on any other—more directly. But the substitution of one vibration for the other—in circumstances, in action, in objects—occurs at the point where it can have the most striking and effectual results.</p>

And when it disappears one has the precise perception that the intervention or the manifestation of the true vibration does not depend on egos or individualities — human or national individualities or even those of Nature: animals, plants, etc. It depends on a certain play of the cells and Matter in which some agglomerates are particularly favourable to the transformation — not “transformation”, but substitution, to be precise: the substitution of the vibration of Truth for the vibration of Falsehood. And this phenomenon can be quite independent of any groupings or individualities — it may be one piece here, one piece there, one thing here, one thing there — and it always corresponds to a certain quality of vibration that brings about an expansion — a receptive expansion. Then the phenomenon can take place.</p>

When the earth is ready for the supramental life, he will come.

<p class="P" id="aphorism-113-114" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1061" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">113 - Hatred is the sign of a secret attraction that is eager to flee from itself and furious to deny its own existence. That too is God’s play in His creature.</p>
<p class="P" id="aphorism-114" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1062" style="font-weight:bold;  text-indent: 40px;">114 - Selfishness is the only sin, meanness the only vice, hatred the only criminality. All else can easily be turned into good, but these are obstinate resisters of deity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1063">This corresponds to a kind of vibration — the vibration received from people who hate. It is a vibration that is fundamentally the same, so to say, as the vibration of love. In its very depths there is the same sensation. Although on the surface it is the opposite, it is supported by the same vibration. And one could</p>
<span id="page_212"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 212</p>
<p class="PE">say that one is the slave of what one hates just as much as of what one loves, perhaps even more so. It is something that grips you, that haunts you, and which you cherish; a sensation you cherish, for underneath its violence there is a warmth of attraction which is just as great as the warmth you feel for what you love. And it seems that this distortion in the appearance only exists in the activity of the manifestation, that is, entirely on the surface.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1064">One is obsessed by what one hates even more than by what one loves. And the obsession comes from this inner vibration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1065">All these "feelings"—what to call them?—have a mode of vibration, with something very essential at the core, and covering layers, as it were. And the most central vibration is the same, and as it expands to express itself, it becomes distorted. With love, it is quite obvious; it becomes, outwardly, in the vast majority of cases, something whose nature is quite different from the inner vibration, because it is something that withdraws into itself, shrivels up and wants to draw things towards itself in an egoistic movement of possession. You <em>want</em> to be loved. You say, "I love that person," but at the same time there is what you want; the feeling is lived as, "I want to be loved." And so this distortion is almost as great as the distortion of hatred which consists in wanting to destroy what you love in order not to be bound by it. Because you cannot obtain what you want from the object of your love, you want to destroy it in order to become free; in the other case, you shrivel up almost in an inner rage, because you cannot obtain, you cannot absorb what you love. And truly speaking (<em>laughing</em>), from the standpoint of the deeper truth, there is not much difference!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1066">It is only when the central vibration remains pure and expresses itself in its initial purity, which is an unfolding — what to call it?... it is something that radiates, a vibration that spreads out in splendour; and it is a blossoming, yes, a radiant blossoming — then it remains true. And materially, this is translated as self-giving, self-forgetfulness, generosity of soul. And that is the</p>
<span id="page_213"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 213</p>
<p class="PE">only true movement. But what is usually called “love” is as far removed from the central vibration of true Love as hatred; only, one withdraws, shrivels up and hardens, and the other strikes. This is what makes all the difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1067">And it is not seen with ideas, it is seen with vibrations. It is very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1068">In fact I have had to study this a great deal recently. I have had the opportunity to see these vibrations. The external results may be deplorable, from the practical point of view they may be dreadful; that is to say, this kind of vibration encourages the urge to harm, to destroy; but from the standpoint of the deeper truth, this distortion is not much greater than the other, it is only of a more aggressive nature — and even then...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1069">If one pursues this experience further and deeper, if one concentrates on this vibration, one realises that it is the initial vibration of creation, the vibration which has been altered, distorted in all that exists. And then there is a kind of all-embracing warmth — one cannot call it exactly a “sweetness”, but it is a kind of strong sweetness — an all-embracing warmth in which there is as much smile as sadness — much more smile than sadness....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1070">This does not justify the distortion, but it is above all a reaction to the choice that the human mentality — especially the human morality — has made between one kind of distortion and another. There is a whole series of distortions that have been labelled “bad” and there is a whole series of distortions towards which people are full of indulgence, almost compliments. And yet from the essential point of view these distortions are not much better than the others — it is a matter of choice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1071">In fact, one should first perceive <em>the</em> central vibration and then appreciate its <em>unique</em> and wonderful quality so much that one would automatically and spontaneously avoid all distortions, whatever they may be, the virtuous as well as the vicious.</p>

What we know as “the eternal Principle”, “the Supreme”, “God”, has neither beginning nor end — we are obliged to say “it is”, but it is not like that, because it is beyond Non-Manifestation and Manifestation; it is something which we are unable to understand and perceive in the Manifestation — and that is what has neither beginning nor end. But constantly and eternally, That is manifested in something that begins and ends. Only there are two ways of “ending”, one which appears to be a destruction, an annihilation, and another which is a transformation; and it would seem that as the Manifestation becomes more perfect,</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1079">I have had a perception of this manifestation—a "pulsating" manifestation, one might say, which expands and contracts, expands and contracts.... And there comes a time when there is such an expansion, such a fluidity, plasticity, capacity for change that there is no longer any need for it to be reabsorbed so that it can take a new form; and there will be a progressive transformation. I used to know an occultist who said that this is the seventh universal creation, that there have already been six <em>pralayas</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="215-17" href="#">17</a> and that this is the seventh creation, but that this one will be able to transform itself without being reabsorbed—which obviously has no importance whatsoever, for when one has the eternal consciousness it does not matter whether it is like this or like that. Only in the limited human consciousness is there this kind of ambition or need for something that has no end, because, within, there is what might be called the "memory of eternity" and this memory of eternity aspires for the manifestation to share in this eternity. But if this sense of eternity is active and present, we do not grieve; we do not grieve when we throw away a spoiled garment—we may be attached to it, but even so we do not grieve! It is the same thing: if a universe disappears, it means that it has fully fulfilled its function, it has come to the end of its possibilities and must be replaced by another one.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1080">I have followed the whole curve. When you are very small in consciousness and development, you feel a great need that the earth should not disappear, that it should continue perpetually — it can go on transforming itself, but it should always be the earth that goes on. A little later, when you are a little more mature, you give it much less importance. And when you are in constant communion with the sense of eternity, it becomes merely a question of choice; it is no longer a need, because it is something that does not affect the active consciousness. A few days ago — I do not remember when, but very recently — I lived this Consciousness for a whole morning and I saw, in the curve of the being’s development, that this kind of need, which seems to be deep-seated, for the life of the earth to be prolonged — for the life of the earth to be prolonged indefinitely — this need is objectified, so to say, it is no longer so deep-seated; it is like looking at a performance and judging whether it should be like this or like that. It was an interesting change of viewpoint.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1081">It is like an artist, but an artist giving shape to himself, making one trial, two trials, three trials, as many as he needs, and then achieving something complete enough in itself and receptive enough to be able to adapt to new manifestations, to the needs of these new manifestations, so that it would not be necessary to draw everything back in, to mix it all up and bring it all out again. But it is nothing more than this, and as I say, a question of choice. After all, the manifestation is made for the delight of objectivisation — the delight or interest or, well... And once what has taken shape is plastic enough, receptive enough, flexible enough and vast enough to be capable of being constantly moulded by the new forces that are manifesting, there is no longer any need to unmake everything in order to remake it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1082">With the curve also came an adage, “What has a beginning must have an end” — this seems to be one of those human mental constructions that are not necessarily true.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1085">As soon as one tries to express it (<em>Mother makes a gesture of reversal</em>), everything becomes warped.... I was looking at this experience of the relation with the Consciousness, the All; this relation of the human being with the All; of the earth—the consciousness of the earth—with the All; of the consciousness of the manifested universe with the All; and of the consciousness that presides over the universe—over all the universes—with the All; and this inexpressible phenomenon that each point of consciousness—a point that does not occupy any space—each point of consciousness is capable of <em>all</em> experiences.... It is very difficult to express.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1086">One could say that only limits make differences—differences in time, differences in space, differences in size, differences in power. It is only the limits. And as soon as the consciousness goes outside its limits at any point in the manifestation, whatever the dimension of this manifestation—yes, the dimension of this manifestation has absolutely no importance—at any point in the manifestation, if one goes outside the limits, it is <em>the</em> Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1087">From this standpoint one could say that it is the acceptance of limits that has made the manifestation possible. The possibility of manifestation came with the acceptance of the sense of limits.... It is impossible to express. Always, as soon as one begins to speak, one has the impression of something which does this (<em>same gesture of reversal</em>), a kind of tipping over, and it is finished, the essential thing has gone. Then the metaphysical sense comes along and says, "One could put it like</p>
<span id="page_218"></span>

<p class="PE"> this, one could put it like that...." To use words: every point contains the Consciousness of Infinity and Eternity—these are words, nothing but words. But the possibility of this experience is there. It is like stepping back out of space.... It might be amusing to say that even stone, even... oh, water certainly, fire certainly, has <em>the</em> power of Consciousness—the original—all the words that come are stupid—essential, primordial—all that means nothing—eternal, infinite Consciousness.... All this is meaningless, it gives me the impression of dust thrown on glass to prevent it from being transparent!... Finally, in conclusion, after having relived this experience—these last few days I have had it repeatedly, it reigned supreme, in spite of everything, work, activities, it ruled over everything—any attachment to any formula, even the ones that have stirred people through the ages, seems childish to me. And now it's only a matter of choice: you can choose whether it is like this or like that or like that; you can say this or this or that—amuse yourselves, my children... if it amuses you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1088">But it is certain—this is an observation for general use—it is certain that the human mind, in order to have the urge to act, needs to build a dwelling-place—more or less large, more or less complete, more or less flexible—but it needs a dwelling-place. Only (<em>laughing</em>) it is not that! That distorts everything!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1089">And what is strange, what is strange, is that outwardly one goes on living automatically according to certain ways of life, which no longer even have the virtue of seeming necessary to you, which no longer even have the force of habit, and which are accepted and lived almost automatically, with a sense — a kind of feeling or sensation, but it is neither feeling nor sensation, it is a kind of very subtle perception — that Something, so immense that it is undefinable, wants it. I say “wants” it or I say “chooses” it, but it is “wills” it; it is a Will that does not function like the human will, but which wills it — which wills it or sees it or decides it.

It came to me with an absolute certitude—although it is very difficult to express—that this so-called "error" of the material world as it is, was indispensable; that is to say, the material mode or way of perceiving, of becoming aware of things, was gained through the "error" of this creation and would not have existed without it, and it is not something that will vanish into non-existence when we gain the true consciousness—it is something that <em>is added</em> in a special way—which was perceived, lived at that moment in the essential Consciousness.</p>

You see, there was always this great "Why?"—"Why is it like this?" Why is there all this, which brought about everything that the human consciousness interprets as suffering, misery and helplessness and everything, all the horrors of ordinary consciousness—why? Why is it? And so this was the answer: in the true Consciousness there is a mode of vibration, of precision and exactness and clarity in objectivisation, which could not have existed without that, which would not have had any opportunity to manifest. That is certain. That is the answer—the all-powerful answer to the "why".</p>

To come down to the level of terrestrial thought, one might say that there is no manifestation without progress. But what <em>we</em> call progress, what is "progress" to our consciousness, up there it is... it can be anything, a necessity, whatever you like—there is a kind of absolute that we do not understand, an absolute of being: it is like that because it is like that, that is all.

Images, that is to say, poetry. Here there is an almost more direct way of access to that inexpressible vibration.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1098">Yesterday or the day before, throughout the day, from morning till night, something was saying, “I am — I am or I have the consciousness of the dead on earth.” I am translating it into words, but it was as if I was being told, “This is what the consciousness of a dead person is like, relative to the earth and physical things... I am a dead person living on earth.” According to the position of the consciousness — for the consciousness is always changing its position — according to the position of the consciousness, it was, “This is how dead people are, relative to</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 222</p>
<p class="PE"> the earth"; then, "I am absolutely like a dead person relative to the earth"; then, "I am living as a dead person lives in the consciousness of the earth"; then, "I am exactly like a dead person living on earth..." and so on. I went on behaving, speaking, acting as usual. But it has been like this for a long time. For a long time, for more than two years, I have been seeing the world like this (<em>upward gesture from one level to another</em>) and now I see it like this (<em>downward gesture</em>). I do not know how to explain this because there is nothing mentalised about it, and non-mentalised sensations have something hazy about them which is hard to define. But the words and the thought were a certain distance away (<em>gesture around the head</em>), like something that watches and evaluates, that is to say, which says what it sees—something that is all around. And today, two or three times, it was extremely strong—I mean that this state dominated the whole consciousness—a kind of impression or sensation or perception—but it is none of these: I am a dead person living on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1099">How to explain that?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1100">And so, for example, with regard to sight, there is no objective precision (<em>Mother makes a gesture of not seeing with the eyes</em>). I see through and by the consciousness. As regards hearing, I hear in a very different way; there is a kind of discrimination—it is not "discernment"—something in the perception which chooses, something which decides—decides, but not automatically—what is heard and what is not heard, what is perceived and what is not perceived. It already exists with sight but it is even stronger with hearing: for some things one can only hear a continuous hum and others are crystal-clear; others are vague, scarcely audible. With sight it is the same thing: everything is behind a luminous mist, as it were—very luminous, but still a mist, that is to say, there is no precision—and then, suddenly, there is something absolutely precise and clear, an extraordinarily precise vision of detail. Usually, the vision is the expression of the consciousness in things. That is to say, everything seems</p>
<span id="page_223"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 223</p>
<p class="PE">more and more subjective, less and less objective.... And they are not visions that impose themselves on the sight or sounds that impose themselves on the hearing; there is a kind of movement of consciousness which makes some things perceptible and others a kind of very vague background.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1101">There is nothing personal—nothing personal. Of course there is a feeling of choice and decision, but there is no feeling of personal choice and decision. Besides, the personal becomes little more than the need to introduce this (<em>Mother touches her hands</em>). For example, eating is very queer, very queer.... It is as if someone were looking on at a body—which is not even something very precise and very definite, but a kind of conglomeration that holds together—and were looking on... at something that is happening! No, it is really a queer state. Today, it was very strong, it dominated the whole consciousness. And there are even moments when one has the feeling that the slightest thing would make you lose the contact (<em>gesture of disconnection, as if the link with the body were broken</em>) and it is only when one keeps very still and very indifferent—indifferent—that it can continue.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1102">These experiences are always preceded by a kind of very intimate and very inward closeness to the Supreme Presence, with a kind of suggestion: “Are you ready for anything?” Naturally I reply, “Anything.” And the Presence becomes so marvellously intense that there is a kind of thirst in the whole being: that it should be like that constantly. Only That exists, only That has any reason to exist. And in the midst of it comes the suggestion: “Are you ready for anything?”</p>

And that vibration exerts a pressure on people, things, circumstances, to mould them according to its vision. And it is irresistible.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1133">The resistances of the inertia that is in every consciousness and in Matter mean that this Action, instead of being direct and perfectly harmonious, becomes confused, full of contradictions, clashes and conflicts; instead of everything resolving itself "normally", so to say, smoothly—as it should be—all this inertia that resists and opposes, gives it a tangled movement in which things collide and there is disorder and destruction, which become necessary only because of the resistance, but which were <em>not indispensable</em>, which might not have existed—which truly speaking should not have been—because this Will, this Power is a Power of perfect harmony where each thing is in its place, and it organises things wonderfully. It comes as an absolutely luminous and perfect organisation, which one can see when one has the vision; but when it comes down and presses on Matter, everything begins to seethe and resist. Therefore, to attempt to impute the disorders and confusions and destructions to the divine Action, to the divine Power, is another human foolishness. It is the inertia—not to mention the bad will—which <em>causes</em> the catastrophe. It is not that the catastrophe was intended, nor even foreseen, it is <em>caused</em> by the resistance.</p>

Modern knowledge says to the race, “Man, thou art an ephemeral animal and no more to Nature than the ant and the earthworm, a transitory speck only in the universe. Live then for the State and submit thyself antlike to the trained administrator and the scientific expert.” Will this gospel succeed any better than the other?</p>

When the union is perfect, there only remains “a fiercer form of delight”.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1921">All the Mother's commentaries were spoken or written in French. She also translated Sri Aurobindo's text into French. Her translations of and commentaries on the first twelve aphorisms were published in 1959 under the title <em>Pensées et Aphorismes: Traduits et Commentes par La Mère</em>. The remaining translations and commentaries were serialised in French and English in the quarterly <em>Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education</em> between April 1960 and August 1976. A complete edition of the French text, entitled <em>Pensées et Aphorismes: Traduits et Commentes par La Mère</em>, was published in two tomes in 1974 and 1976. The first complete edition in English appeared in 1977 as Volume Ten of the Collected Works of the Mother. The present edition is a reprint of this volume with a few minor corrections.

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1922">Sri Aurobindo's <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em> was written around 1913 during the early part of his stay in Pondicherry. Never revised or published during his lifetime, the aphorisms were first brought out in 1958 under the three headings established by the author: Jnana (Knowledge), Karma (Works) and Bhakti (Devotion).

<p class="P" search_id="On Thoughts and Aphorisms - 1923">When the original manuscript of <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em> was examined preparatory to the publication of a new edition of the English text in 1977, several erroneous readings were found in the text of the first edition; this was the edition used by the Mother in making her translation and commentaries. These errors, mostly minor, have been corrected in this volume. A note has been given wherever the corrected reading is not in line with the Mother's comment.
