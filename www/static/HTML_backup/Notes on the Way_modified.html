<h1><em>Publisher's Note</em></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 10">During the years 1961 to 1973 the Mother had frequent conversations with one of her disciples about the experiences she was having at the time. She called these conversations, which were in French, <em>l’Agenda</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 11">Selected transcripts of the tape-recorded conversations were seen, approved and occasionally revised by the Mother for publication in the <em>Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education</em>; they appeared regularly from February 1965 to April 1973 under the titles "Notes on the Way" and "A Propos". The English translations that accompanied the French text in the <em>Bulletin</em> were sometimes read out to the Mother for approval; the same translations, with minor revisions, are published in this volume, number eleven of the Collected Works of the Mother.

	The following introductory note preceded the first of the "Notes on the Way" conversations:

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 13">
	"We begin under this title to publish some fragments of conversations with the Mother. These reflections or experiences, these observations, which are very recent, are like landmarks on the way of Transformation: they were chosen not only because they illumine the work under way — a yoga of the body of which all the processes have to be established — but because they can be a sort of indication of the endeavour that has to be made."

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 14">Things have clearly taken a turn for the better, not from the ordinary point of view but from the higher. Yet the material consequences are still there — all the difficulties are as though aggravated. Only, the power of the consciousness is greater — clearer, more precise, and also the action upon those who are of good will; they make quite considerable progress. But the material difficulties are as though aggravated, that is to say, it is... to see if we can stand the test!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 15">It is like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 16">It isn’t long (since yesterday), something has cleared in the atmosphere. But the way is still long — long, long. I feel it is very long. One must last — hold on, above all, that is the impression — one must have endurance. These are the two absolutely indispensable things: endurance, and a faith that nothing can shake, even an apparently complete negation, even if you suffer, even if you are miserable (I mean to say, in the body), even if you are tired — to last. To hold on and to last — to endure. That is it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 17">But according to what I have been told, I mean by people who listen to the radio, read newspapers (all the things that I do not do), the whole world seems to be undergoing an action... which for the moment is upsetting. It seems that the number of the “apparently mad” is increasing considerably. In America, for example, the entire youth seems to have taken up with a sort of curious brain-wave which would be disquieting for reasonable people, but which is certainly an indication that an unusual force is at work. It is the breaking up of all habits and all rules — it is good. For the moment, it is rather “strange”, but it is necessary.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>The true attitude, at present, is it not to try to be as transparent as possible?</em></p></blockquote>
<span id="page_3"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 3</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 18">Transparent, receptive to the new force.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I put the question to myself because the impression is that this transparence is transparent, but it is somewhat like nothingness, a nothingness that is full; all the same it is nothingness, one does not know. One does not know if it is a kind of higher tamas, or...</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 19">Above all, to be confident. The big difficulty in Matter is that the material consciousness (that is to say, the mind in Matter) has been formed under the pressure of difficulties — difficulties, obstacles, sufferings, struggles. It has been, so to say, “worked out” by these things and that has left upon it a stamp, almost of pessimism, defeatism, which is certainly the greatest obstacle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 20">It is of this that I am conscious in my own work. The most material consciousness, the most material mind is accustomed to act, to make an effort, to advance through whippings; otherwise, it is <em>tamas</em>. And then, so far as it imagines, it imagines always difficulty, always the obstacle or always the opposition, and that slows down the movement terribly. Very concrete, very tangible and <em>often repeated</em> experiences are needed to convince it that behind all its difficulties there is a Grace, behind all its failures there is the Victory, behind all its pains, its sufferings, its contradictions, there is Ananda. Of all efforts it is this one which has to be repeated most often; all the while you are obliged to stop or to remove, to convert a pessimism, a doubt or an imagination altogether defeatist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 21">I am speaking exclusively of the material consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 22">Naturally, when something comes down from above, that makes, well... a crash, like that (<em>Mother makes a gesture of flattening</em>), then all is silent, all stops and waits. But... I understand well why the Truth, the Truth—Consciousness does not express itself more constantly, because the difference between its Power and the power of Matter</p>
<span id="page_4"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 4</p>
<p class="PE">is, as it were, annulled — but then that does not mean transformation, that means crushing. That is what they used to do in ancient times — they crushed all this material consciousness under the weight of a Power against which nothing can struggle, which nothing can oppose. And then one had the impression: “There you are! It has been done.” But it has not been done, not at all!—for the rest, down below, remained as before, without changing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 23">Now it is being given the full possibility to change; well, for that you must allow it full play and not interpose a Power that crushes it — this I understand very well. But this consciousness has the obstinacy of the imbecile. How many times during a suffering, for example, when a suffering is there, acute, and one has the impression that it is going to become unbearable, there is the little inner movement (within the cells) of Call — the cells send their S.O.S. — everything stops, the suffering disappears, and often (now more and more) it is replaced by a feeling of blissful well-being; but the very first reaction of this imbecile material consciousness is: “Ah! We shall see how long that is going to last”, and naturally, by this movement it demolishes everything — one must begin all over again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 24">I believe that for the effect to be lasting—not a miraculous effect that comes, dazzles and goes away—it must really be the effect of a <em>transformation</em>. One must be very, very patient—we have to deal with a consciousness very slow, very heavy, very obstinate, which is not able to advance rapidly, which clings to what it has, to what has appeared to it as truth; even if it is quite a tiny truth, it clings to that and does not want to move. Then to cure that, one must have very much patience—much patience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 25">The whole thing is to hold on, to endure, to endure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 26">Sri Aurobindo has said this many times in many forms: Endure and you’ll conquer... bear — bear and you’ll vanquish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 27">Triumph comes to the most enduring.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 28">So then, that seems to be the lesson for these conglomerates</p>
<span id="page_5"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 5</p>
<p class="PE"> here (<em>Mother points to her body</em>)—bodies appear to me simply as conglomerates and so long as there is a will behind to keep them together for some reason or other, they remain together.... In the last few days, yesterday or the day before, there was this experience: a kind of consciousness wholly decentralised (I am speaking <em>always</em> of the physical consciousness, not of the higher consciousness at all), a decentralised consciousness which happened to be here, there, there, in this body, in that body (in what people call "this person" and "that person", but this notion does not exist very much any more), then there was a kind of intervention of a universal consciousness with regard to the cells, as though it asked those cells for what reason they wanted to keep this combination, if one can call it so, or that conglomerate. Indeed, they were made to understand or feel the difficulties coming from the number of years, the wear and tear, the external difficulties, in sum, all the deterioration caused by friction and usage—but that seemed to them quite unimportant. The answer was rather interesting in the sense that they did not seem to attach importance to anything other than <em>the capacity to remain in conscious contact with the higher Force</em>. It was like an aspiration (not formulated in words, naturally), what is called in English "a yearning", "a longing" for this contact with the divine Force, the Force of Harmony, the Force of Truth, the Force of Love. And it is because of that that they appreciate the present combination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 29">It is altogether another point of view.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 30">I express it with the words of the mind, for there is no other way, but it was in the domain of sensation rather than any other thing. And it was very clear — it was very clear and very continuous, there were no fluctuations. At that moment, this universal consciousness intervened, saying, “There! — the obstacles”, and these obstacles were clearly seen (this kind of pessimism of the mind — a formless mind which is about to be born and organise itself in the cells), but the cells themselves cared nothing for it; it appeared to them as a kind of</p>
<span id="page_6"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 6</p>
<p class="PE"> disease (the word deforms, but they had the impression as of an accident or an inevitable disease or something which did not form a normal part of their development and which was imposed upon them). Then, <em>at that moment</em>, there was born a kind of <em>lower</em> power to act upon these things (this physical mind); that has given a <em>material</em> power to separate itself from that and reject it. And it is after that that there was this turning of which I spoke just now, the turning in the circumstances as a whole, as if truly something decisive had happened. There was as though a confident joy: "Ah! We are free from this nightmare."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 31">And at the same time, a relief — a physical relief, as though the air was easier to breathe — yes, a little as though one was closed in a shell — a suffocating shell — and that... in any case an opening has been made within. And you breathe. I do not know if it is more than that, but it is as though a fissure was made, an opening, and you breathe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 32">And it was an altogether material, cellular action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 33">But as you descend into that domain, the domain of the cells, even of the very constitution of the cells, how it seems less heavy! This sort of heaviness of Matter disappears—it begins again to be fluid, vibrant. This would tend to prove that the heaviness, thickness, inertia, immobility, is something <em>added</em>, it is not a quality essential to... it is the false Matter, that which we think and feel, but not Matter itself, as it is. This was clearly felt.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 34" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 35">The best one can do is not to take sides, not to have preconceived ideas or principles—oh! The moral principles, the set rules of conduct, what one must do and what one must not and the preconceived ideas from the moral point of view, from the point of view of progress, and all the social and mental conventions... no worse obstacle than that. There are people, I know people who have lost decades in surmounting <em>one</em> such</p>
<span id="page_7"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 7</p>
<p class="PE"> mental construction!... If one can be like that, open—truly open in a simplicity, well, the simplicity that knows that it is ignorant—like that (<em>gesture upward, of self-abandon</em>), ready to receive whatever comes. Then something can happen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 36">And naturally, the thirst for progress, the thirst for knowledge, the thirst for transformation and, above all, the thirst for Love and Truth — if one keeps that, one goes quicker. Truly a thirst, a need, a need.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 37">All the rest has no importance; it is <em>that</em> one has need of.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 38">To cling to something one believes that one knows, to cling to something that one feels, to cling to something that one loves, to cling to one’s habits, to cling to one’s so-called needs, to cling to the world as it is, it is that which binds you. You must undo all that, one thing after another. Undo all the ties. And it has been said thousands of times and people continue to do the same thing.... Even they who are most eloquent and preach that to others, do c-l-i-n-g — they cling to their way of seeing, their way of feeling, their habit of progress, which seems for them the only one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 39">No more bonds — free, free. Always ready to change everything, except one thing: to aspire, this thirst.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 40">I understand well, there are people who do not like the idea of a "Divine", because immediately it gets mixed up with all those European or Occidental conceptions (which are horrible) and then that complicates their life somewhat—but you are not in need of that!—the "Something" one is in need of, the Love one is in need of, the Truth one is in need of, the supreme Perfection one is in need of—and that is all. The formulas... the fewer formulas there are the better. But that: a need, which <em>the</em> Thing alone can satisfy—nothing else, no half-measure, only that. And then, you go!... Your way will be your way, that has no importance—whatever the way, it does not matter, it does not matter; even the extravagances of the modern American youth can be a way; that has no importance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 41">As Sri Aurobindo says: “If you cannot make God love you,</p>
<span id="page_8"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 42">The whole thing is to hold on. And to hold on, I have found only one way; it is this Calm, the inner calm — a calm that has to become all the more... (how to say it?) complete, as the struggle is more material.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 43">There has been for some time past (particularly since the first of January) a kind of bombardment of adverse forces—a fury, you know. Then you must remain like this (<em>Mother becomes immobile like a statue</em>), that is all. And when physically you have been shaken, you must not ask too much of the body, you must give it a good deal of tranquillity, a good deal of rest.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>The difficulty is that I am very much absorbed by the condition of this body, it takes away much of my consciousness—the physical mind, for example, invades me completely.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 44">Yes, I know it very well. But that is always the difficulty, the difficulty of everyone. That is why in the past they used to tell you, "Get away! Leave it alone to flounder about—you get away." But we have no right to do that, it is contrary to our work. And you know, you can arrive very well at an almost absolute freedom with regard to your body, so much so that you can feel nothing, nothing at all. But I no longer have even the right to exteriorise myself, just imagine! Even when I am quite unwell or things are quite difficult or even when I am left a little quiet, that is to say, at night, and I say to myself, "Oh, to go into my blissfulness"—it is not permitted. I am bound there (<em>Mother touches her body</em>). It is there, there that it is to be realised.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 45">It is for that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 46">Only from time to time, for a precise action (sometimes it comes like a flash of lightning, sometimes for a few minutes</p>
<span id="page_10"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="PE">only), the great Power that was there before, that used to be constantly felt, comes rushing, does its work, then goes away. But never on this body. It never does anything for this body — it is not a higher intervention that will change it, it is... from within.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 47">The same thing is happening to you, it happens to everybody who does the work, and that is the difficulty. That is why I tell you: "It does not matter, do not worry if you are occupied with your body; only try to <em>profit</em> by that—profit by this preoccupation—to bring into it the Peace, the Peace." Always it is as though I was enveloping you within a cocoon of Peace. And then, if you could put, precisely into this mind that vibrates, stirs all the while, truly like a monkey, if you could put there... it is a Peace which acts <em>directly</em> in this material vibration—a Peace in which everything relaxes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 48">Do not think, do not think of trying to transform this physical mind or to silence it or abolish it; all that is still activity. Simply let it go on, but... put the Peace, feel the Peace, live the Peace, know the Peace — the Peace, the Peace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 49">That is the only thing.</p>

Seeing Sri Aurobindo wounded, she ran, ran looking for you.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 50">It is perhaps simply an image of what happened on February 11.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11-1" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 51">The foot means something physical.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 53">Premonitory? No.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 54">The foot means his physical action through some people or through the Ashram or through me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 55">I do not think it is serious. It is the image of what happened and it was recorded somewhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 56" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 57">It is quite a curious development. For some time past, but in a more and more precise manner, when I hear something or something is read to me, or when I hear music or someone narrates a fact, I feel immediately: the origin of the activity or the plane on which it is happening or the origin of the inspiration is rendered</p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-11-1"><sup>1</sup> The Ashram was attacked by rioters. Some houses were looted and burnt.</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 12</p>
<p class="PE"> automatically by a vibration in one of the centres. And then, according to the quality of the vibration, it is either constructive or negative, and when that touches, however little it may be, at a given moment, a domain of Truth, there is... (how to say it?) a spark, as it were, of a vibration of Ananda. And the thought is absolutely silent, immobile, nothing—nothing (<em>Mother opens her hands upward in a gesture of total self-offering</em>). But this perception is becoming more and more precise. And I know in this way—I know where the inspiration comes from or where the action is situated and the quality of the thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 58">And it has a precision! oh! infinitesimal in detail. The first time I felt it clearly was when I heard the music composed for "The Hour of God"; it was the first occasion and at that time I did not know that it was a well-organised thing, a kind of organisation of experience. But now, after all these months, that has been regularised and for me it is an absolutely sure indication, which does not correspond to any active thought, any active will—I am simply an infinitely delicate machine for receiving vibrations. That is how I know where things come from. There is no thought. That is how the vibration of this dream came to me (<em>Mother makes a gesture downward, under the feet</em>); it was in the domain of the subconscient. So I knew that it was a matter of recording.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 59">The other day when Z read to me his article, it was neutral (<em>vague gesture at mid-height</em>), all the while neutral, then all of a sudden, a spark of Ananda; it was this which made me appreciate it. And just now, when you read this text of Y, there was a small ray of light (<em>gesture at the height of the throat</em>), then I knew. A pleasant ray of light—not of Ananda, but a pleasant light, so I knew that there was something in it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 60">And there are degrees, to be sure, almost an infinity of qualities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 61">That is the way given to me for finding out the position of things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 62">And it is quite, quite outside the thought. Only <em>afterwards</em>,</p>
<span id="page_13"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 13</p>
<p class="PE"> when you asked me, for example, about the dream, I said, "Logically, since the vibration is there (<em>downward gesture</em>), it must be a memory." And with a kind of certitude, because... because the perception is altogether impersonal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 63">It is an extraordinarily delicate mechanism and its field of receptivity (<em>gesture of gradation</em>) almost infinite.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 64">My way of knowing people is also like that now. But since a long time past, when I see a photograph, for example, it does not at all pass through the thought; these are not deductions or intuitions—that creates a vibration somewhere. And then amusing things also happen. The other day I was given the photograph of someone, then I clearly felt it; by the place which was touched, by the answering vibration, I knew that this man had the habit of handling ideas and possessed the assurance of someone who teaches. I ask, in order to see, "What does this man do?" I am told, "He does business." Then I say, "But he is not made for business, he understands nothing of it." And three minutes after I am told, "Ah, excuse me, please; he is a professor!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) It is like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 65">And it is so constantly, constantly: the evaluation of the world, the vibrations of the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 66">That is why I asked you to give me your hands just now. Why? It was just to have the vibration. Well, I felt what is called in English “a sort of dullness”. I said to myself: “He is not all right.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 67">And no thinking, nothing, simply like this (<em>Mother remains still in a gesture of self-offering upward</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 68">Then what is it that is not all right? (<em>Mother laughs</em>) Yes, it is that, it is a kind of dullness.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 69">It is that.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 70">No, but can’t you get out of it?</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I am harassed. And my body does not help me much either.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 71">Ah, no, the body never helps; now I am convinced of it. You can to a certain extent help your body — not very much, but still to an extent you can help your body. But the body does not help you. Always its vibration is on the ground.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Yes, it is heavy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 72">Without exception. Without exception it is a lowering and, above all that, it is something that makes you dull, dull — it does not vibrate.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>It is heavy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 73">But with this sadhana that I am following, there are some leading strings which one can pursue. I have some phrases of Sri Aurobindo.... For the other sadhanas I had the method: whatever he said was clear; that showed the way, one had not to search. But here he has not done it; only he has said or made some remarks from time to time and these remarks are useful to me (also there is the night when I meet him, but I do not want to count too much upon that, for... you become too anxious to have this contact and that spoils everything). There are a few remarks that have been so retained by me and they are, yes, like leading strings; for example, “Endure... endure.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 74">Suppose you have a pain somewhere; the instinct (the instinct of the body, the instinct of the cells) is to shrink and to seek to reject — that is the worst thing, that increases it invariably. Therefore, the first thing to teach the body is to remain immobile, to have no reaction; above all, no shrinking, not even</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 75">A perfect immobility.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 76">After the perfect immobility comes the movement of inner aspiration (I always speak of the aspiration of the cells—I use words for what has no word, but there is no other way of expressing it), the surrender, that is to say, the <em>spontaneous and total</em> acceptance of the supreme Will (which one does not know). Does the All-Will want things to go this way or that way, that is to say, towards the disintegration of some elements or towards...? And there also, there are infinite shades: there is the passage between two heights (I speak of cellular realisations, do not forget that); I mean one has a certain inner poise, a poise of movement, of life, and it is understood that while passing from one movement to a higher movement, almost always there occurs a descent and then an ascent—it is a transition. Then, does the shock you receive push you downward to make you rise again or does it push you downward to abandon the old movements?—for there are cellular ways of being that should disappear in order to give place to other ways. There are others that tend to rise upward again with a higher harmony and organisation. This is the second point. And one must wait and see, <em>without postulating in advance</em> what should be. Above all, there is the desire—the desire to be at ease, the desire to be in peace, all that—which must absolutely cease, disappear. One must be absolutely without reaction, like this (<em>gesture with palms open, of motionless offering upward</em>). And then, when one is like that ("one" means the cells), after a time comes the perception of the category to which the movement belongs, and one has only to follow in order to see whether it is something that has to disappear and be replaced by another thing (which is not known for the moment) or it is something that has to be transformed.</p>

If the thing passes through the mind, especially this physical thinking which is absolutely imbecile, absolutely, you cannot know; so long as it is working you are always led to do what you should not do, to have particularly the bad reaction — the reaction that helps the forces of disorder and obscurity instead of counteracting them. And I am not speaking of anxiety, because for a very long time now there has been no anxiety in my body — a long time, many years — but anxiety is like swallowing a cup of poison.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 79">This is what is called physical yoga.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 80">One must overcome all that. And the only way to do it: at every second all the cells must be (<em>gesture of motionless offering upward</em>) in an adoration, in an aspiration—an adoration, an aspiration, an adoration... and nothing else. Then after a time there is also delight, then that ends in blissful trust. When this trust is established all will be well. But... it is easy to say, it is much more difficult to do. Only, for the moment I am convinced that this is the only means, there is no other.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 95">It is not the physical mind. It is long since the physical mind has changed.... It is the material mind—not even the material mind: it is the mind <em>of Matter</em>. It is the mental substance which belongs to Matter itself, to the cells. That is what was once called the "spirit of the form", when it was said that mummies kept their body intact as long as the spirit of the form persisted.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="19-1" href="#">1</a> It is that mind, this wholly material mind.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 96">The physical mind is the mind of the physical personality formed by the body. It grows with the body, but it is not the mind of Matter: it is the mind of the physical being. For example, it is this physical mind which gives the character — the bodily character, the physical character — and which is in a large measure formed by atavism and by education. All this is called the “physical mind”. Yes, it is the result of atavism, of education and of the formation of the body; it is what forms the physical character. For example, there are people who are patient, people who are strong, etc. — physically I mean, not for vital or mental reasons,</p>

And as long as the spirit of the form persists, the body is not destroyed. In ancient Egypt they had this knowledge; they knew that if they prepared the body in a certain way, the spirit of the form would not leave it and the body would not disintegrate.”

<p class="PE">but purely physically; you have a character. It is the physical mind. And this is part of all integral yoga; you go through the discipline of this physical mind. More than sixty years ago I did it.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>But then, for example, this mind which is spontaneously defeatist, having all sorts of fears, apprehensions, always seeing the worst, repeating always the same things, is it the physical mind or the material mind?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 98">That is the most unconscious part of the physical mind and that is the link joining the physical mind and this material substance. But it is already an organised mind, you must understand. It is the most material part touching the mind.... How can one call this “mind”? You cannot even call it the bodily mind — it is the mind of the cells, it is a cellular mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 99">This cellular mind exists in animals, and even a little (very little, as a promise) beginning in the plants—they respond to a mental action. They do respond. As soon as Life manifests, there is already a promise of mind, of mental movement. And in animals it is clear. Whereas this physical mind truly begins to exist only in man. It is this which very little children already have; they already have a physical mind; that is to say, two babies are not the same, their reactions are not the same, there is already a difference. And it is this, above all, which is given to you with the special <em>form</em> of your body, by atavism, and then fully developed by education.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 100">No, the physical mind, as soon as you take up an integral yoga, must be dealt with; but this material mind, the cellular one, I assure you, is altogether new, yes, altogether new.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 101">It is the mind which was like an unco-ordinated substance, which was constantly active, but not organised (<em>Mother makes a gesture of continuous trepidation</em>). It is this which is now being organised. It is that which is important—for Sri Aurobindo had said that it was unorganisable and it had only to be thrown</p>
<span id="page_21"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 21</p>
<p class="PE"> out of existence. And I too had the same impression. But when the action for transformation upon the cells is constant, this material mind begins to be organised. It is this that is wonderful—it begins to be organised. And as it is being organised, it learns to <em>keep silent</em>—that is most remarkable! It learns to keep quiet, keep silent and allow the supreme Force to act without interfering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 102">The greatest difficulty is in the nerves, because they are so accustomed to the ordinary conscious will that when it stops and the direct Action from the highest is asked for, they go mad, as it were. The other day I had this experience, which lasted more than an hour, and it was difficult; but this taught me many things — many. And all this is what can be called the “transfer of power”; the former power withdraws; and then before the body adapts itself to the new power, there is a period which is critical. As all the cells are in a state of constant aspiration, it goes relatively quickly, but all the same... the minutes are long.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 103">But more and more there is a kind of certitude in the cells that whatever happens is in view of this transformation and this transfer of directing power. And even at the time when it is materially painful (not even physically: materially painful), the cells keep this certitude. And then they resist, they bear the suffering without depression, without being affected in any way, with this certitude that it is to prepare for the transformation, the process of transformation and of the transfer of directing power. As I said, it is in the nerves that the experience is the most painful—naturally, because they are the most sensitive cells, those that have the most acute sensation. But they have a very considerable, very spontaneous, spontaneously strong receptivity—without any effort—to the harmonious physical vibration (which is very rare, but still it exists in some individuals). And this physical vibration, what might be called a physical <em>force</em>, a harmonious physical vibration (spontaneously harmonious, without the necessity of a mental vibration, like the vibrations of a flower, for example; there are physical vibrations like that, which</p>
<span id="page_22"></span>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 106">Naturally, one must carefully avoid allowing a mental organisation to intervene; that is why I do not try to explain too much; the mind would come in and then it is no more that.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 107" style="font-style:italic">This talk begins with Mother’s comments on the message distributed on the Darshan day of November 24th.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">"<em>It is certainly a mistake to bring down the light by force—to pull it down. The Supramental cannot be taken by storm. When the time is ready it will open of itself—but first there is a great deal to be done and that must be done patiently and without haste."</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Sri Aurobindo</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 108">It is good for reasonable people. They will say, “There, he does not promise miracles.”</p>
<p class="Q"><em>Why? Do many people have the tendency to "pull down"?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 109">People are in a hurry, they want to see the results immediately. And then, they believe they are pulling down the Supramental — they pull down some small vital individuality who mocks at them and in the end makes them play the shabby fool. This is what happens most often — ninety-nine times out of a hundred.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 110">A small individuality, a vital entity who plays the big play and makes a great show, plays of light. Then the poor fellow who has “pulled” is bedazzled; he says, “There, it is the Supramental”, and he falls into a pit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 111">It is only when you have touched, seen in some way and had a contact with the true Light, that you can distinguish the vital, and you perceive that it is altogether like the plays of light on a stage, an artificial light. But otherwise, others are dazzled—it is dazzling, it is "wonderful", and then they are deceived. It is only when you have <em>seen</em> and when you have had the contact with the Truth, ah! then you smile.</p>
<span id="page_24"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 112">It is quackery, but you must know the truth in order to recognise quackery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 113">At bottom, it is the same for everything. The vital is like a superstage that gives shows — very attractive, dazzling, deceptive; it is only when you know the True Thing that you recognise immediately, instinctively, without reasoning, and you say, “No, I do not want that.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 114">And for everything it is so. Where it has taken a capital importance in human life is with regard to love. Vital passions, vital attractions have almost everywhere taken the place of true feeling, which is quiet, whereas the other puts you in ferment, gives you the feeling of something “living”. It is very deceptive. And you do not know it, you do not feel it, you do not perceive it clearly unless you know the True Thing. If you have touched true love through the psychic and the divine union, then the other thing appears hollow, thin, empty — an appearance and a comedy, more often tragic than comic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 115">Whatever one may say about it, however one may explain it, is of no use at all, because he or she who is caught says immediately, “Oh, this is not what it is for others” — what happens to yourself is never like what happens to others! One must have the true experience, then the whole vital appears like a masquerade — not attractive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 116">And when you “pull”, well, it is much more than ninety-nine times out of one hundred... out of a million there is found only one case where one happens to pull the True Thing — this proves one was ready. Otherwise it is always the vital which you pull, the appearance, the theatrical show of the Thing, not the Thing itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 117">To pull is always an egoistic movement. It is a deformation of aspiration. True aspiration consists in a giving, a self-giving, whereas to pull means to want for oneself. Even if in the mind you have a vaster ambition — the earth, the universe — that means nothing, these are mental activities.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>No.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 120">Sri Aurobindo was there from the morning till the evening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 121">For, yes, for more than an hour he made me live, as in a concrete and living vision of the condition of humanity and of the different strata of humanity in relation to the new or supramental creation. And it was wonderfully clear and concrete and living.... There was all the humanity which is no longer altogether animal, which has benefited by mental development and created a kind of harmony in its life — a harmony vital and artistic, literary — in which the large majority are content to live. They have caught a kind of harmony, and within it they live life as it exists in a civilised surrounding, that is to say, somewhat cultured, with refined tastes and refined habits. And all this life has a certain beauty where they are at ease, and unless something catastrophic happens to them, they live happy and contented, satisfied with life. These people can be drawn (because they have a taste, they are intellectually developed), they can be attracted by the new forces, the new things, the future life; for example, they can become disciples of Sri Aurobindo mentally, intellectually. But they do not feel at all the need to change materially; and if they were compelled to do so, it would be first of all premature, unjust, and would simply create a great disorder and disturb their life altogether uselessly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 122">This was very clear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 123">Then there were some — rare individuals — who were ready to make the necessary effort to prepare for the transformation and to draw the new forces, to try to adapt Matter, to seek means of expression, etc. These are ready for the yoga of Sri Aurobindo. They are very few in number. There are even those who have the sense of sacrifice and are ready for a hard, painful life, if</p>
<span id="page_26"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 26</p>
<p class="PE">that would lead or help towards this future transformation. But they should not, they should not in any way try to influence the others and make them share in their own effort; it would be altogether unfair — not only unfair, but extremely maladroit, for it would change the universal rhythm and movement, or at least the terrestrial movement, and instead of helping, it would create conflicts and end in a chaos.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 124">But it was so living, so real that my whole attitude (how to say it?—a passive attitude which is not the result of an active will), the whole position taken in the work has changed. And that has brought a peace—a peace and a calmness and a confidence altogether decisive. A decisive change. And even what seemed in the earlier position to be obstinacy, clumsiness, inconscience, all kinds of deplorable things, all that has disappeared. It was like the vision of a great universal Rhythm in which each thing takes its place and... everything is all right. And the effort for transformation, reduced to a small number, becomes a thing <em>much</em> more precious and much more powerful for the realisation. It is as though a choice has been made for those who will be the pioneers of the new creation. And all these ideas of "spreading", of "preparing", or of "churning Matter"... are a childishness. It is human restlessness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 125">The vision was of a beauty so majestic, so calm, so smiling. Oh! It was full, truly full of the divine Love. And not a divine Love that “pardons” — it is not at all that, not at all! Each thing in its place, realising its inner rhythm as perfectly as it can.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 126">It was a very beautiful gift.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 127">Well, all these things people know in some part, intellectually, like that, in idea; they know all that, but it is quite useless. In everyday practice you live in another way, with a truer understanding. And there, it is as though you touched the things — you saw them, you touched them — in their higher disposition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 128">It came after a vision of plants and the spontaneous beauty of plants (it is something so wonderful), then of the animal with so harmonious a life (so long as men do not intervene), and all</p>

<p class="PE">that was in its right place; then of the true humanity as humanity, that is to say, the maximum of what a mental poise could create of beauty, harmony, charm, elegance of life, taste of living — a taste of living in beauty, and, naturally, suppressing all that is ugly and low and vulgar. It was a fine humanity — humanity at its maximum, but nice. And perfectly satisfied with its being humanity, because it lives harmoniously. And it is perhaps also like a promise of what almost the whole of humanity will become under the influence of the new creation. It appeared to me that it was what the supramental consciousness could make of humanity. There was even a comparison with what humanity has made of the animal species. It is extremely mixed, naturally, but things have been perfected, bettered, utilised more completely. Animality, under the mind’s influence, has become another thing, which is, naturally, something mixed because the mind was incomplete. In the same way there are examples of a harmonious humanity among well-balanced people, and this seemed to be what humanity could become under the supramental influence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 129">Only, it is very far ahead. You must not expect that it will be immediately — it is very far ahead.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 130">It is clearly, even now, a period of transition which may last quite long and which is rather painful. Only, the effort, sometimes painful (often painful) is compensated by a clear vision of the goal to attain, of the goal that <em>will</em> be attained: an assurance, yes, a certainty. But it would be something that would have the power to eliminate all error, all deformation, all the ugliness of the mental life—and then a humanity very happy, very satisfied with being human, not at all feeling the need of being anything other than human, but with a human beauty, a human harmony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 131">It was very charming, it was as though I lived in it. The contradictions had disappeared. It was as though I lived in this perfection. And it was almost like the ideal conceived by the supramental consciousness, of a humanity become as perfect as it can be. And it was very good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 132">And this brings a great repose. The tension, the friction, all</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>That is to say, you concentrate the work instead of diffusing it a little everywhere?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 133">No, it may be diffused materially, because the individuals are not necessarily collected together. But they are few in number.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 134">This idea of a pressing need to “prepare” humanity for the new creation, this impatience has disappeared.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 135">Quite so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 136">I was seeing, I saw that in such a concrete way. Apart from those who are fit to prepare the transformation and the supramental realisation, and whose number is necessarily very restricted, there must develop more and more, in the midst of the ordinary human mass, a superior humanity which has towards the supramental being of the future or in the making the same attitude as animality, for example, has towards man. There must be, besides those who work for the transformation and who are ready for it, a superior humanity, intermediary, which has found in itself or in life this harmony with Life—this harmony <em>human</em>—and which has the same feeling of adoration, devotion, faithful consecration to "something" which seems to it so high that it does not even try to realise it, but worships it and feels the need of its influence, its protection, and the need to live under this influence, to have the delight of being under this protection. It was so clear. But not this anguish, these torments of wanting something that escapes you because—because it is not your destiny yet to have it, and because the amount of transformation needed is premature for your life and it is that then which creates a disorder and suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 137">For example, one of the very concrete things that brings out</p>
<span id="page_29"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="PE">the problem well: humanity has the sexual impulse in a way altogether natural, spontaneous and, I would say, legitimate. This impulse will naturally and spontaneously disappear with animality. Many other things will disappear, as for example the need to eat and perhaps also the need to sleep in the way we sleep now. But the most conscious impulse in a superior humanity, which has continued as a source of... bliss is a big word, but joy, delight — is certainly the sexual activity, and that will have absolutely no reason for existence in the functions of Nature when the need to create in that way will no longer exist. Therefore, the capacity of entering into relation with the joy of life will rise by one step or will be oriented differently. But what the ancient spiritual aspirants had sought on principle — sexual negation — is an absurd thing, because this must be only for those who have gone beyond this stage and no longer have animality in them. And it must drop off naturally, without effort and without struggle. To make of it a centre of conflict and struggle is ridiculous. It is only when the consciousness ceases to be human that it drops off quite naturally. Here also there is a transition which may be somewhat difficult, because the beings of transition are always in an unstable equilibrium; but within oneself there is a kind of flame and a need which makes it not painful — it is not painful effort, it is something that one can do with a smile. But to seek to impose it upon those who are not ready for this transition is absurd.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 138">It is common sense. They are human, but they must not pretend that they are not.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 139">It is only when spontaneously the impulse becomes impossible for you, when you feel that it is something painful and contrary to your deeper need that it becomes easy; then, well, externally you cut these bonds and it is finished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 140">It is one of the most convincing examples.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 141">It is the same with regard to food. It will be the same thing. When animality will drop off, the absolute necessity of food also will drop off. And there will probably be a transition where one</p>

And when they see that others do not, cannot understand, their first reflex is to be horribly shocked; they exclaim, “What an idiot!” But they are not at all idiots — they are different, they are in another domain. You do not go and say to an animal, “You are an idiot”; you say, “It is an animal.” Well, you say, “It is a man.” It is a man; only, there are those who are no longer men and are not yet gods, and they are in a situation... rather awkward.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 147">I experienced this morning, for two hours, a kind of blissful state in which there was such a clear consciousness that all the forms of life, in all the worlds and at all moments, are the expression of a choice — one chooses to be like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 148">It is very difficult to say with words.... The kind of obligation in which one believes oneself to be living, to which one believes oneself to be submitted, had completely disappeared, and it was quite a spontaneous and natural perception that the life upon earth, and the life in other worlds, and all kinds of life upon earth and all kinds of life in other worlds are simply a question of choice: you have chosen to be like that and you choose constantly to be like this or to be like that, or whether it happens like this or it happens like that; and you choose also to believe that you are submitted to a fatality or to a necessity or to a law which compels you — everything is a question of choice. And there was a feeling of lightness, of freedom, and then a smile for everything. At the same time it gives you a tremendous power. All feeling of compulsion, of necessity — of fatality still more — had disappeared completely. All the illnesses, all the happenings, all the dramas, all that: disappeared. And this concrete and so brutal reality of the physical life: gone completely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 149">I lived this state for more than an hour and a half this morning. Afterwards, I was obliged to return... to a state which appears to me artificial, but which is compulsory because of others, by contact with others and with things, and the innumerable quantity of things to be done. But all the same, in the background the experience remains. And there remains a kind of amused smile for all the complications of life — the state in which one finds oneself has been the fact of a choice, and for the individual the freedom of choice is there, and people have forgotten it. It is this that is so interesting.</p>
<span id="page_32"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 32</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 150">I saw at the same time the whole tableau of human knowledge (because when those states are there, all human realisations, all human knowledge, come like a panorama before the new state and are put each in its place — always, always when an experience comes, it is as though retrospective) and I saw all the theories, the beliefs, the philosophies, the way they link themselves with the new state; it was amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 151">And that does not call for a rest. These experiences are so concrete, so spontaneous and real (they are not the result of a will, still less of an effort) that they do not call for a rest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 152">But those who managed to have this experience for whatever reason, and who had not a thorough philosophical and mental preparation (the saints or in fact all those who led a spiritual life) had then a very acute impression of the unreality of life and the illusion of life. But it is only a narrow view. It is not that, it is not that. Everything is a choice! <em>Everything</em>, everything. The Lord's choice, but in us, not there (<em>gesture upward</em>): here. And we do not know it, it is quite within the heart of ourselves. And when we know it, we can choose—we can choose our choice, it is wonderful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 153">And this sort of fatality and bondage and hardness of existence, all have disappeared. All disappeared. It was light blue, light rose, all luminous and limpid and light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 154">I conceive very well that this is not an absolute thing; it was only a way of being, but a very charming way of being.... Usually those who have not a sufficient intellectual preparation, when they have an experience of this kind, they believe they have caught the sole truth. And then with that, they dogmatise. But I saw quite well that it is not that, it is <em>one</em> way of being, although it is a fine way of being, well, infinitely superior to what we have here. And we can have it here: I have had it. I have had it in an altogether concrete way. And there is always something that is not all right, wrong here or wrong there, or this or that, and then circumstances also that are not all right; always there are difficulties—all that... that changes colour.</p>
<span id="page_33"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 33</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 155">And it becomes light, light — light, supple. All the hardness and stiffness: gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 156">And the feeling also that if you choose to be like that, you can continue to be like that. And it is true. It is all the wrong habits — evidently millennial habits upon earth — all the wrong habits that prevent you. But there is no reason why this should not be a permanent state. Because this changes everything! Everything changes!... It is evident that if one becomes master of that state, one can change all the circumstances around oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 157">In recent times (for a rather long time), there was this same difficulty with the body, which is not limited and shut up in a shell as is generally the case, and which receives spontaneously, not even with the feeling of "receiving", which <em>has</em> the vibrations of all that surrounds it. And then, when all that surrounds it is, from the mental and moral point of view, closed, uncomprehending, it is a little difficult; that is to say, they are elements that come and must be transformed. It is a kind of totality, a very multiple and very unstable totality, representing your field of consciousness and action, and upon which you must work all the time to re-establish a harmony, a minimum of harmony. And when around you something goes "wrong" according to the ordinary idea, it makes the work a little difficult. It is at the same time tenuous and persistent and obstinate. I remember, just before the experience, there was in the body an aspiration for harmony, for light, for a kind of smiling peace. The body aspired above all for a harmony, because of all these things that grind and scrape. And probably the experience has been the result of this aspiration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 158">Only, I have noted that in the life of this body I have never had the same experience twice—I may have the same kind of experience in a higher degree or in a much vaster degree, but never identically the same. And I do not retain the experience; I am all the while, all the while (<em>gesture forward</em>), all the while on the march. Yes, the work of transformation of the consciousness</p>
<span id="page_34"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 34</p>
<p class="PE"> is so rapid, must be done so quickly that there is no time to enjoy or dwell upon an experience or get some satisfaction in it for any length of time—it is impossible. It comes forcefully, very forcefully; that is to say, it changes everything. And then something else comes. It is the same with regard to the transformation of the cells. All kinds of small disorders come, but they are visibly, for the consciousness, disorders of transformation; and then one is busy with that point, one wants to re-establish the order. And at the same time there is something that knows pertinently that the disorder has come to make the transition from ordinary automatic functioning to conscious functioning under the direct guidance and the direct influence of the Supreme. And the body itself knows it; all the same it is not amusing to have pain here or pain there, or to have this or that get out of order, but it <em>knows</em>. And when that point has arrived at a certain degree of transformation, one passes on to another point, then another, then yet another; so nothing is done, no work is done definitively until... everything is ready. Then the same work has to be begun again on a higher or vaster level or with greater intensity or more in detail (that depends upon the case), until the <em>whole</em> is brought to a point homogeneous and ready in a similar way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 159">As I see it, it is moving as fast as it can, but it takes a long time. And everything is a question of changing the habit. The entire automatic habit of thousands of years has to be changed into a conscious action directly guided by the supreme Consciousness.</p>

People are thrust without the least defence into the lowest vital, and according to their nature they find it either frightful or marvellous. For example, the cloth covering a cushion or a chair suddenly takes on a wondrous beauty. This lasts for about two or three hours. Naturally, they are completely out of their senses the whole time. And the pity of it is that people call these “spiritual experiences”, and there is nobody to tell them that this has nothing to do with spiritual experience.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 164">And so this gave me yet another proof.... I saw pictures in <em>Life</em>—there were some photographs—it was as though you had entered a madhouse. For these are images registered in the subconscient—images of thoughts, images of sensations, images of feelings, registered in the subconscient—which become objective, which come up to the surface and become objective. Thus they give the exact picture of what is within.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 165">For instance, if you have the feeling or thought that someone is wicked or ridiculous or does not like you, in short, ideas of this kind — generally all this comes up in dream, but here you are not asleep and you have the dream! — they come to play the game you have thought of; what you have thought of them comes back upon you in their form. So this is an indication: for those who see happy, amiable, beautiful images, this means that within, everything is going on quite well (vitally), but for those</p>

It was something I had to do. Now, for instance, this entry into the vital has been often described: there is a passage where beings are posted to keep you from entering (much has been said about these things in books of occultism). Well, I know by an experience, not casual, but repeated and understood, that this opposition or this malevolence is ninety per cent psychological, in the sense that if you do not anticipate it or fear it, or that there isn’t something in you that fears the unknown nor has all these movements of apprehension and so forth, then it is like a shadow across a picture or the projection of an image: it has no concrete reality.</p>

The idea that "this could very well happen" and the fact that I was expecting it, made the blow come. I knew it for certain. And if I had been in what may be called my "normal state", of inner certitude, this could not have touched me, it could not. And I had had this apprehension because an occultist whom I knew, had lost an eye in a vital fight and she had told me about it; and so (<em>Mother laughs</em>), that gave me the idea that this was possible, because it had happened to her! But when I am in my own state—I cannot even say that, it is not "personal", it is a way of being—when one is in the true state, when one is a conscious being and has the true way of being, this <em>cannot</em> touch one.</p>

<p class="Q"><em>Why is there suffering? How to cure suffering?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 196">For a long time quite recently, that is to say, for days together, there was a very acute, very intense, very clear perception that the action of the Force translated itself externally by what we call “suffering” because that is the only kind of vibration which can pull Matter out of its inertia.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 197">The supreme Peace, the supreme Calm are deformed and disfigured into inertia and into <em>tamas</em>, and precisely because this was the deformation of true Peace and Calm, there was no reason why it should change! A certain vibration of awakening—of reawakening—was necessary to come out of this <em>tamas</em>, that could not pass directly from <em>tamas</em> to Peace; something was needed to shake the <em>tamas</em>, and that is translated externally by suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 198">I am speaking here of physical suffering, because all the other sufferings — vital, mental, emotional sufferings — are due to a wrong working of the mind, and these... may simply be classed together as Falsehood, that’s all. But physical suffering gives me the impression of a child being beaten, because here, in Matter, Falsehood has become ignorance; that is to say, there is no bad will — no bad will is there in Matter, all is inertia and ignorance: complete ignorance of the Truth, ignorance of the Origin, ignorance of the Possibility and ignorance even of what is to be done in order not to suffer physically. This ignorance is everywhere in the cells, and it is only the experience, the experience of what is translated in this rudimentary consciousness as suffering, which can awaken, bring forth the need to know and to cure, and the aspiration to transform oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 199">It has become a certainty, because in all the cells there is born the aspiration, which is becoming more and more intense and</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE">which wonders at the resistance; but they have observed that whenever something goes wrong in the working (that is to say, instead of being supple, spontaneous, natural, the working becomes a painful effort, a struggle against something which takes the appearance of a bad will, but is only a reticence that does not understand), at that moment, the intensity of the aspiration, of the call, is tenfold, becomes constant. The difficulty is to remain at that state of intensity. Generally everything falls back, I cannot say into a somnolence, but a kind of relaxation: you take things easy; and it is only when the inner disorder becomes painful that the intensity grows and remains permanent. For hours — hours together — without slackening, the call, the aspiration, the will to be united with the Divine, to become the Divine, is maintained at its maximum. Why? Because there was externally what is called a physical disorder, a suffering. Otherwise, when there is no suffering, from time to time one soars up, then one falls back into a slackening; again another time one soars up once more... there is no end to it. That lasts eternally. If we want things to go fast (relatively fast according to the rhythm of our life), this smack of the whip is necessary. I am convinced of it, because as soon as you are within your inner being you look upon that with contempt (as regards oneself).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 200">But then, all of a sudden, when there comes this true Compassion of the Divine Love, and when one sees all these things that appear so horrible, so abnormal, so absurd, this great pain which is upon all beings and even upon all things... then there takes birth in this physical being the aspiration to soothe, to cure, to remove that. There is in Love, at its Origin, something which is translated constantly as the intervention of Grace: a force, a sweetness, something like a vibration of solace spread everywhere, but which an illumined consciousness can direct, concentrate on some points. And it is there, there itself that I saw the true use one can make of thought: thought serves as a kind of channel to carry this vibration from place to place, wherever it is necessary. This force, this vibration of sweetness is there in a</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 44</p>
<p class="PE">static way upon the world, pressing in order to be received, but it is an impersonal action. And thought — illumined thought, surrendered thought, thought which is no longer anything but an instrument, which tries no longer to initiate things, which is satisfied with being moved by the higher Consciousness — thought serves as an intermediary to establish a contact, a relation, and to enable this impersonal Force to act wherever it is necessary, upon definite points.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 201">It may be said in an absolute way that an evil always carries its own remedy. One might say that the cure of any suffering coexists with the suffering. So, instead of seeing an evil “useless” and “stupid” as it is generally thought to be, you see that the progress, the evolution which has made the suffering necessary — which is the cause of the suffering and the very reason for its existence — attains the intended result; and at the same time the suffering is cured, for those who are able to open themselves and receive. The three things — suffering as a means of progress, progress, and the cure of suffering — are coexistent, simultaneous; that is to say, they do not follow each other, they are there at the same time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 202">If, at the moment when the transforming action creates a suffering, there is in that which suffers the necessary aspiration and opening, the remedy also is taken in at the same time, and the effect is total, complete: transformation, with the action necessary to obtain it, and, at the same time, cure of the false sensation produced by the resistance. And the suffering is replaced by... something which is not known upon this earth, but which is akin to joy, well-being, trust and security. It is a supersensation, in a perfect peace, and which is obviously the only thing that can be eternal.</p>

<p class="PE">upon earth. But physical Matter, in its cellular form, has, one cannot say fear or anxiety, but a kind of apprehension of new vibrations, and this apprehension naturally takes away from the cells their receptivity and assumes the appearance of uneasiness — it is not suffering, but an uneasiness. When, however, this apprehension is counterbalanced and cured by aspiration and the will for total surrender and by the act of total surrender, then this sort of apprehension, having disappeared, becomes a supreme well-being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 205">All this, they are as though microscopic studies of the phenomena of consciousness, free from mental intervention. The necessity of using words to express oneself brings this mental intervention, but in the experience it does not exist. And it is very interesting, because the pure experience has a content of truth, of reality, which disappears as soon as the mind intervenes. There is a savour of true reality which altogether escapes expression because of that. It is the same difference as between an individual and his portrait, a fact and the story told. It is like that. But it is much more subtle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 206">And then, to come back to what we were saying just now, when one is conscious of this Force — this Force, this Compassion in its essential reality — and when one sees how it can act through the conscious individual, one has the key to the problem.</p>

<p class="Q"><em>"... although St. Paul had remarkable mystic experiences and, certainly, much profound spiritual knowledge (profound rather than wide, I think)—I would not swear to it that he is referring to the supramentalised body (physical body). Perhaps to the supramental body or to some other luminous body in its own space and substance, which he found sometimes as if enveloping him and abolishing this body of death which he felt the material envelope to be. This verse<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46-1" href="#">1</a> like many others is capable of several interpretations and might refer to a quite supraphysical experience. The idea of a transformation of the body occurs in different traditions, but I have never been quite sure that it meant the change in this very matter. There was a yogi sometime ago in this region who taught it, but he hoped when the change was complete, to disappear in light. The Vaishnavas speak of a divine body which will replace this one when there is the complete siddhi. But, again, is this a divine physical or supraphysical body? At the same time there is no obstacle in the way of supposing that all these ideas, intuitions, experiences point to, if they do not exactly denote, the physical transformation."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46-2" href="#">2</a></em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 208">It is strange, this was the very subject of my meditations these days—not deliberate, they are imposed from above. Because through the entire passage from the plant to the animal and from the animal to man (especially from the animal to man), essentially the differences in form are minimal; the true transformation lies in the intervention of another agent of consciousness. All the differences between the life of the animal and the life of man come from the intervention of the Mind; but the substance is essentially the same and it obeys the same laws of formation and construction. For example, there is not much difference between a calf that is formed in the womb of the cow and the child that is formed in the womb of the mother. There is a difference, that of the intervention of the Mind; but if we look at a <em>physical</em> being, that is to say, visible as the physical is visible now and having the same density (for example, a body having no need of circulation, or of bones—particularly these two: the skeletons and blood circulation), it is difficult to conceive. And as long as it is like that, with this circulation of the blood, this action of the heart, one could imagine—one can imagine—by a power of the Spirit, the renewal of force, of energy, through means other than food; this is conceivable; but the rigidity, the solidity of the body—how is that possible without the skeleton?... In that case, this would be a transformation infinitely greater than that from the animal to man; this would be a passage from man to a being who would not be built in the same manner, who would no longer function in the same manner, who would be like the condensation and concretisation of "something".... Up to now, that corresponds to nothing we have yet seen physically, unless the scientists have found something I do not know about.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 212">I conceive very well a being who could, by spiritual power, the power of his inner being, absorb the necessary forces, renew himself and remain always young; that one conceives very well, even for giving a certain suppleness so as to be able to change the form, if need be.

These two things are possible: the</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 50</p>
<p class="PE"> power of life can come and the wear and tear can disappear. And that can come psychologically, through a total obedience to the divine Impulsion, which enables one to have at each moment the force that is needed, to do the thing that is needed—all that, all that, these are certitudes; it is not a hope, it is not an imagination: these are certitudes. Well, one must educate and slowly transform, change one's habits. It is possible, all that is possible. But only, how long would it take to do away with the necessity (let us take this problem only) of the skeleton? That seems to me to be a matter still very far away. That is to say, many intermediary stages will be necessary. Sri Aurobindo said that life could be prolonged indefinitely. That, yes. But we are not yet built with something that wholly escapes dissolution, the necessity of dissolution. The bones are very durable, they can even last a thousand years if they are in favourable conditions, it is understood; but that does not mean immortality <em>in principle</em>.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 223">Well, yes!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 224">There is this question only. Perpetual change, that I conceive; I could even conceive of a flower that does not fade, but it is this principle of immortality... That is to say, in essence, a life which escapes from the necessity of renewing itself: that it is the eternal Force which manifests itself directly and eternally, and yet it should be this, a physical body (<em>Mother touches her skin with her fingers</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 225">I understand very well a progressive change and that one could make of this substance something which might renew itself from within to the outside and eternally—and that, that would be immortality; but only, it seems to me that between what is now, as we are, and this other mode of life, there have to be many stages. Well, these cells, with all the consciousness and experience they have now, if you ask them, for example, "Is there anything that you cannot do?", they will answer in their sincerity, "No, what the Lord wills, I can do." This is their state of consciousness. But in appearance it is otherwise. The personal experience is this: whatever I do with the Presence of the Lord, I do without effort, without difficulty, without fatigue, without waste, like this (<em>Mother indicates a wide harmonious rhythm</em>); only it is still open to all the influences from outside and the body is obliged to do things that are not directly the expression of the supreme Impulsion; from there come the fatigue, the friction....

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 230">Yes.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 233">My feeling (it is a kind of feeling-sensation) is that there should be intermediary stages.</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 234">And then, when you see how man had to fight against the whole of Nature in order to exist, you have the feeling that these beings — those who will understand them, who will help them — will have with them a relation of devotion, attachment, service, as animals have for men. But those who will not love them... they will be dangerous beings. I remember, once I had a very clear vision of the precarious situation of these new beings, and I had said (it was before 1956, before the descent of the supramental power), I had said, “The Supramental will first manifest itself in its aspect of Power, because it will be indispensable for the safety of the beings.” And indeed it is Power that descended first — Power and Light: Light that gives Knowledge and Power.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 235">It is a thing that I am feeling more and more: the necessity of intermediate periods.... It is quite evident that something is in the process of happening, but it is not the "something" that has been seen and foreseen and which will be the culmination; it is <em>one</em> of the stages that is going to come about, it is not the culmination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 236">Sri Aurobindo also has said that first of all there will come the power to prolong life at will (it is much more subtle and wonderful than that), but that is a state of consciousness which is in the process of being established; it is a kind of relation, and of constant, established contact with the supreme Lord; and that abolishes the sense of wear and tear and replaces it by an extraordinary flexibility, an extraordinary plasticity. But the state of <em>spontaneous</em> immortality is not possible—not possible, at least for the present. This structure must change into something other than this; and in order to change into something other than this—in the way things are happening, it will take long. It may go faster than in the past, but even admitting that the movement rushes forward , even then it will take time (according to our notion of time). And what is, besides, quite worth noticing, is that one must change one's sense of time if one is to be in the state of consciousness where wearing out does not</p>

<p class="PE">exist; one enters into a state where time no longer has the same reality. It is something else. It is very special, it is an uncountable present. Even this habit that one has, of thinking beforehand or of foreseeing what is going to happen, is a stumbling-block, is a clinging to the old manner of being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 237">So many, so many habits to change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 238">The integral realisation will come about only when one can be divine spontaneously. Oh! To be divine spontaneously, without turning to see that one is so, having passed beyond the stage where one wants to be so.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 241">It is perhaps a lesson (it is an indication), but it has a purpose. The lesson that I have to understand, I am trying to understand. I am learning to be patient, oh! such a patience.... Always there are revolts, insults, all that. For me it is absolutely zero and sometimes it is even amusing. When I am in my own condition, the true condition of compassion, it changes nothing, it does not raise even a small ripple on the surface, nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 242">The question was put to me yesterday; I was asked if insult, the feeling of being insulted, and what is called in English "self-respect" (something corresponding a little to <em>amour-propre</em> in French) had any place in the sadhana. Of course, there is no place for it, it is well understood! But I have seen the movement, it was very clear, I have seen that without ego, when the ego is not there, there <em>cannot be</em> this sort of ruffle in the being. Because I went back far into the past to a time when I still used to feel it (many years ago), but now, it is no longer something foreign even, it is something impossible. The whole being, and even (it is strange), even the physical constitution does not understand what that means. It is the same thing when there is materially a shock (<em>Mother shows a scratch on her elbow</em>), like that for example; it is no longer felt as one feels an injury, it is no longer felt like that. Most often there is nothing at all, it passes absolutely unperceived in the whole; but when something is felt, it is only the impression—a very, very gentle, very intimate impression of a help seeking to make itself felt,</p>

<p class="PE">a lesson that is to be learnt. But not as one does in the mental way in which there is always a stiffening; it is not that, it is immediately a sort of offering of the being, which gives itself in order to learn. I am speaking of the cells. It is very interesting. Evidently if you mentalise, you must say that it is the feeling or consciousness of the divine Presence in all things and that the mode — the mode of contact — derives from the state in which you are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 243">Yes, that is the experience of the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 244">And in individuals, when there is any knock or shock, always the only perception is a clear vision of the ego—the ego manifesting itself. They say, "It is the other." I would not say, "Oh! That one was angry" or "Oh! This one... ", no, it is his ego; not even his ego: the ego, <em>the ego</em> principle—the ego principle which still intervenes. It is very interesting, because the ego has become for me a kind of impersonal entity, while for everybody else it is the acute sense of his personality! Instead of that, it is a kind of way of being (terrestrial or human, one can say), which is in greater or lesser quantity here or there or there, giving each one the illusion of personality. It is very interesting.</p>

It is like men who know how to fall: they fall, they break nothing; whereas men who do not know how to fall, just a little fall and they break something. It is the same thing. One must learn how to be... the perfect unity. To correct, to straighten, is still resistance. So what will happen if the invasion, as you say, continues? It will be amusing, let us see!

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 252">The body had the habit of performing its functions automatically, as a natural thing; that is to say, for it there was no question of their importance or usefulness. It had not, for example, this mental or vital view of things, of what is "important" or what is "interesting" and what is not. That did not exist. And then, now that the cells are becoming conscious, they stand back, as it were (<em>Mother makes a gesture of withdrawal</em>), they look at themselves, they are beginning to look at themselves in action, and they are very much questioning to what purpose all that is. And then, an aspiration: "How? How should it be truly? What is our function, our utility, our basis? Yes, what is our basis and our standard of life?" One might say, translating once more in mental terms: "How will one be when one is divine? What difference will there be? What is the divine way of being?" And there, what speaks is all this sort of physical basis, which is entirely made up of thousands of small things, absolutely indifferent in themselves, which have no reason for existing except as a whole, as a totality, as a support for another action; but in themselves they seem to have no meaning. And then, once more it is the same thing: a kind of receptivity, of silent opening allowing the thing to enter; and a very subtle perception of a way of being that would be luminous, harmonious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 253">This way of being is still very undefinable; but in this quest, there is a constant perception (translated by a vision) of a multi-coloured light, of all the colours—all the colours, not in layers but as though (<em>gesture of dotting</em>) it was a grouping of all the colours by dots. It is now two years (perhaps a little more, I do not remember) since I met the Tantriks. I was in relation with them and I began to see that Light, and I thought that it was the "tantrik light", the tantrik way of seeing the material world.</p>
<span id="page_59"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 59</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 254"> But now I see it constantly, associated with everything, and it seems to be what might be called a "perception of true Matter". All possible colours are joined together without being mixed up (<em>same gesture of dotting</em>), and joined together by luminous dots. Everything is as if made of that. And this seems to be the true way of being—I am not yet sure, but in any case, it is a way of being much more conscious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 255">And I see it all the while: with open eyes, closed eyes, all the while. And you have a strange (for the body), a strange perception, at once of subtleness, of penetrability, if one may say so, of suppleness of form and positively not of an eradication but a considerable diminution of the rigidity of forms — eradication of rigidity, not eradication of forms: a suppleness in the forms. And the body itself, when for the first time it felt this in one part or another, had the impression — it was a bit lost, as it were — the impression that something was escaping. But if one keeps quiet and waits quietly, that is simply replaced by a sort of plasticity, of fluidity, which seems to be a new way for the cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 256">It would probably be what materially must replace the physical ego; that is to say, the rigidity of the form appears to be yielding to this new way of being. But, well, we know the first contact is always very “surprising”, but gradually the body gets accustomed. It is the moment of the passage from one way to the other which is a little difficult. That is done very progressively, and yet there is a moment (the moment of the passage), a few seconds that are... the least that one can say is, “unexpected”.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 257">All the habits are in this way undone. And for all the functions it is the same: for blood circulation, for digestion, for respiration—for all the functions. And at the moment of the passage, it is not that the one suddenly replaces the other, but it is a fluid state between the two, and it is difficult. It is only this great Faith, wholly immovable, luminous, constant, immutable—the faith in the real existence of the supreme Lord, in the <em>sole</em> real existence of the Supreme—which enables everything to continue to be the same in appearance.</p>

And I see that for years the body and the whole bodily consciousness used to fall back into the old way, as a safety, as a means of safety, to escape. And now it has agreed not to do it any more, but to accept on the contrary: “Well, if it is dissolution, it is dissolution” — but it accepts whatever will be.</p>

It is the equivalent — it is not the same thing — but it is the equivalent of what happens in the material: you feel that all the normal stability is disappearing. Well, for a long time — a long time — there was this falling back into the habit; and then you are quite at ease, you begin again. And now they do not want it any more: “Whatever happens, we will see” — the great adventure.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 263">One, naturally the most important one, is the way that may be called "spiritual", which is that of contact with the Consciousness—Love-Consciousness-Power, yes, it is that; it is these three aspects: the supreme Love-Consciousness-Power, and the contact, the identification: to render all the material cells capable of receiving That and expressing That—to <em>be</em> That.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 265">There is the occult way, which makes all the intermediary worlds intervene. There is a very detailed knowledge of all the powers and personalities, all the intermediary regions, and it uses all that. It is there that one makes use of the divinities of the Overmind. This is in the second way. Shiva, Krishna, all the aspects of the Mother form part of this second way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 266">And then there is the higher intellectual approach, which is the projection of a spirit transcending the scientific, which seizes the problem from below, and which has its importance also. From the viewpoint of detailed handling, this approach diminishes the approximations, brings a more direct and precise action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 267">If the three can be combined, then evidently the thing will go faster.</p>

And by pushing ahead, by insisting in this way by pushing, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing which is really death.</p>

I have had an example—not an example, but something lived, the full perception—of a person who lived for years with me, who has remained in wholly conscious contact after going out of the body (but going out of the body very materially), and who is not dissolved but is closely associated with another living being, and has continued the life of his <em>own consciousness</em> in this association. And all that—I cannot give the names or the facts, but it is as concrete as it can be. And this continues.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 282">All this has been seen — I saw it long ago, but it came back as an illustration of the new consciousness, just this morning.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 289">“The Divine is lived, but cannot be defined.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 290">And then I added: but as you put to me the question, I answer: “The Divine is the absolute of perfection, eternal source of all that exists, of whom we become conscious progressively, all the while being Himself from all eternity.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 292">But when you look—as you look coming out of the mental activity and as you look at the experience which you have—and you say to yourself: "How to say this? How to explain this?", then what is nearest, most accessible is this: into this "something" which we aspire to become, we put instinctively, spontaneously, all that we wish to be, all that we conceive of as most wonderful, all that is the object of an intense aspiration (intense and ignorant), all that. And with all that you come near to the "Something" and... Essentially, it is not by the thought that you have the contact; you have the contact through something <em>identical</em> in the being, which wakes up by the intensity of the aspiration. And then for oneself, as soon as this contact—this fusion—is obtained, even if only for a second, there is no longer any need to explain: it is something that imposes itself in an absolute way and that is outside and beyond all explanation.</p>

It is a proof that It is there. And it is by the intensity of aspiration that this awakens.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 295">When I received the question, it was altogether as if the person was telling me, "Yes, yes, all that is very good, but after all what is this that is the Divine?"

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 296">At the same time, when there was this look towards the "something" that needed definition, there was a great silence everywhere and a great aspiration (<em>gesture as of a flame rising up</em>), and all the forms which this aspiration took.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 317">Instead of putting “to all that surpasses him”, one might put “to that which surpasses him”, because “all that” is debatable from the intellectual point of view.

It transcends all possible understanding and it dominates him.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 355">(<em>Mother laughs, then remains silent.</em>) People always confuse two ideas. It is from the universal and spiritual point of view that, not positively the "good" as men understand it, but the True, the Truth, will have the last word; it goes without saying. That is to say, finally the Divine will be victorious. That is what is said, what all who have lived a spiritual life have said—it is an absolute fact. Men, in translating it, say, "I am a good boy, I live in accordance with what I think to be true, therefore, all existence should be good for me." (<em>Mother laughs</em>) First of all, one's own appreciation of oneself is always doubtful, and then, in the world as it is now, all is mixed, it is not the Law of Truth that openly manifests itself to the half-blind human consciousness—it will not even understand it. I mean, to be more exact, that it is the supreme vision that is realising itself constantly, but its realisation in the mixed material world does not appear to the ignorant human sight as the triumph of good, what men call good and true. But (to say it in a joking way) it is not the fault of the Lord, it is the fault of men! That is to say, the Lord knows what he is doing, and men do not understand it.</p>

But to see that, one must see the whole, and man sees only... not even the human domain, but only his personal domain, quite small, quite small, microscopic—he cannot understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 360">It is a double thing that is going on completing itself (<em>same gesture of intermixture</em>) and with a mutual action: as the Manifestation becomes more conscious of itself, its expression perfects itself, becomes also more true.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 362">It was one of the things that was seen very clearly the other day, when there was this Consciousness of Knowledge: when the Manifestation will have sufficiently emerged out of the Inconscient so that all this necessity of struggle, created by the presence of the Inconscient, becomes progressively more and more useless, it will disappear quite naturally, and progress, instead of</p>

That is what the human consciousness foresees as a divine creation upon earth — it will still be only one step. But for the present step, it is a kind of harmonious attainment that will change the universal progress (which is ceaseless) into a progress through joy and harmony instead of a progress through struggle and suffering.... But what was seen is that this feeling of insufficiency, of something that is not complete and is not perfect, that, one must foresee, will exist for a very long time — if the notion of time remains the same, that I do not know. But all change implies time, does it not? It may not be translated by time as we conceive it, but it does imply a succession.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 365">For the last several nights I have been passing almost the whole night, many hours, in a place which must certainly belong to the subtle physical and where the material life gets reorganised. It is vast — vast — the crowd is innumerable, but these are individualities, not a crowd; that is to say, I have to deal with each one of them. And then, it is as though at the same time there are documents and writing tables but no walls around! It is a curious place, a very curious place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 366">I have asked myself many a time whether it was the memory of physical forms that made me see this world in that way or whether it is really like that. At times there is no doubt, because it has a character altogether its own, but at other times there is a doubt and I ask myself if it is not in my active memory. Because I am very conscious at that time and everything is extremely natural, and indeed permanent: I find again the same things at the same place, sometimes with slight differences, but differences necessitated by action. That is to say, it is a coherent world, it is not a disorderly imagination. But to what extent are these forms the reflection of natural forms? To what extent are they like that or do we see them like that? I am not yet very sure. I had the same problem when I used to go into the Overmind and <em>see</em> the gods: I had always a kind of hesitation in knowing whether they are truly like that or whether we perceive them like that because of our physical habits.... There, after some time, I came to a conclusion; but here, physically...?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 367">It is a curious thing: there are no doors, no windows, neither ceiling nor floor; all this exists in itself, it does not seem to obey the law of gravitation, that is to say, there is no magnetic attraction of the earth, and yet when one writes (<em>Mother laughs</em>) there seems to be a pen! And when one writes upon something, there seems to be a piece of paper; and when there are documents,</p>
<span id="page_80"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 80</p>
<p class="PE">they seem to be in dockets.... One feels that the substance is not the same, but the appearance is very close. And it is this appearance, and I am yet again putting the question to myself: “Is it because of our ordinary cerebral working that we put this appearance upon it or is it truly so?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 368">There I meet almost everybody. I told you, you are there very regularly and we work. You do not remember. There are others who remember, but their memory is (<em>gesture of a slight twisting of the finger</em>) just a little off the line; that is to say, it is not exactly the same as what I saw. So when they tell me about it, I have altogether the feeling that it is the transcription in their brain that made it so.... And the objective reality of the material world comes from this, that if you see the same object ten times, ten times it resembles itself, with differences that are reasonable, which could be differences due to usage, for example; but there also it is like this! And if you study carefully, even in the physical world two persons do not see things exactly in the same way. There, perhaps it is more accentuated, but it seems to be a similar phenomenon.... The explanation becomes very simple, very easy when you enter into the consciousness where the material reality itself becomes an illusion; it is illusory, it is not exact: the inner reality is more true. Then in that case, it is simple. It is perhaps only our mind that is astonished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 369">Take writing, for example. I have not observed in detail, but when one writes there, one seems to write much more easily. I do not know how to explain it, it takes much less time and things are noted down on paper—but is it really paper? It looks like paper, but things are noted down much more directly.... There is perhaps a similarity, as for example when you use a pen or a pencil: it is not exactly a pen or a pencil but something resembling it, which is... (how to say it?) the prototype or the principle of this object. But what I mean to say is that if we were still in the age of the quill or the pen that one dips in a liquid, probably I would see it like that! It is the <em>essence</em> or</p>
<span id="page_81"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 81</p>
<p class="PE">the principle of the thing that is translated in the memory by a similarity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 370">But it is an action. I know the time only when I come back, for I have made it a habit to notice the time whenever I come back to the material consciousness (I have a watch beside my bed and I look at it) and that is how I can say: "This lasted one hour, that lasted two hours." But there, one has not the sense of time, it is not the same sense—it is the <em>content</em> of the action that matters, and during those hours many, many things are done, many. And so I meet you there very regularly, but many others also, and I am at many places at the same time! And when a person tells me, "But I saw you last night, you did this and that", then up there somewhere, I say, "Yes, it is true", there is just a little (<em>same gesture of twisting</em>), just a little difference, but the essence of the thing is the same.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 371">And I have noticed that these things that are quite near the physical disappear if you wake up all of a sudden, particularly if you stir while waking up, if you make a movement or if you turn on your side. It is only afterwards, if at some time I am very quiet and go within myself, then slowly I can again come in contact with that state. Therefore, it does not surprise me that the majority of people do not remember. Experiences in the vital, in the mental are remembered much more easily, but that which is quite close to the physical...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 372">And it has such a character that if one kept the consciousness of it on waking up, one would look somewhat like a mad person. I had the experience of it just two days back and it has taught me a great deal — I looked, studied and studied until I understood. It was during my afternoon rest (I do not at all sleep in the afternoon, but I go like that into the inner consciousness) and I had fixed beforehand that I would wake up at such an hour, that is to say, I would get up. When it was time, I was deep in the midst of my action and the state of consciousness continued with my eyes open; and then, in that state of consciousness, there was... I cannot say “I”, for it was not the same “I” — no, I</p>
<span id="page_82"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 82</p>
<p class="PE"> am many persons at that moment—but the "I" of that moment had the habit of carrying a watch, a golden wrist-watch (not here materially, but up there) and had forgotten to put on the watch and looked for it and noticed: "Ah! I forgot to put on my watch. What has become of this watch ? Why did I forget?" And when I woke up (I do not carry a watch, you know) and came back to myself, the two consciousnesses were simultaneous and I said loudly, "Where is my watch? I have forgotten to put on my watch", and it is only when I said that (<em>Mother laughs</em>) that I became aware! So that made me reflect; I studied well, looked quietly, saw closely that at that moment the two consciousnesses are quite (<em>Mother superimposes her two hands closely</em>), quite simultaneous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 373">It is very interesting. Oh! There were all sorts of problems which have been solved by that experience. For example, the problem of many who are taken as mad, but who are simply in this subtle consciousness (<em>same gesture of superimposition</em>) which dominates at a given moment and which makes them say things that have no meaning here but have a very clear meaning there. And the consciousness is like this (<em>gesture of superimposition, of almost melting together</em>). This explains many cases of so-called madness. There are also cases of apparent insincerity that are also of like nature, because the consciousness sees clearly in this domain and it is a domain so near that the same names could be given to things; they seem to have the same or quite similar forms, but it is not what is here known by the name "tangible reality"; materially, externally, things are not quite like that. And so there are cases of so-called insincerity which are simply too close a mixture of the two consciousnesses—too close for active discernment. Oh! A whole domain has been made clear, and not only made clear, but has brought with it the key to healing or to transformation. From an inner psychological point of view, this has explained things to an enormous degree, to an enormous degree. That reduces considerably the number of cases of true mental alienation and</p>
<span id="page_83"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 83</p>
<p class="PE"> cases of real falsehood, that is to say, cases where one says deliberately, consciously, the contrary of what is—it cannot be as frequent as one believes. Many say things like that (<em>gesture of floating</em>), things inexact, but which they perceive in a world other than the purely material, in too close a mixture and with not enough discrimination to discover the mixture.... Sri Aurobindo used to say that cases of real ill-will, real hostility and real falsehood are very rare, that is to say, "real" in its absolute sense, in themselves, and conscious, deliberate—deliberate, absolute, conscious—that is rare; and it is that which is described as the hostile beings. But all the rest is a kind of illusion of consciousness—of consciousnesses that intermingle with each other (<em>Mother passes the fingers of her right hand into those of the left in a to-and-fro movement</em>) and, being without precise discrimination between the different consciousnesses, are like this (<em>same gesture</em>), mixed, the one entering and coming out of the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 374" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 375">So the result was to see the immensity of the problem to be solved and of the way to follow and the transformation to achieve.... When you look from the purely psychological standpoint, it becomes relatively easy and quick, but when you come to this (<em>Mother touches her body</em>), to the external form, to what is called Matter, oh, it is a world! Each lesson—it is like lessons that are given, it is so interesting! lessons with all the consequences and explanations; you pass a day, two days to make a small, a very small discovery. And then you see that in the bodily consciousness, after that, after these days or these hours of work, the light is there, it is changed—it is changed, the reactions are no longer the same, but... (<em>gesture indicating a world of work</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 376">And the Presence, the Presence becomes more and more intimate, more and more concrete, and at that time there are moments when it is (<em>gesture of swelling up</em>) so concrete that</p>

It is this disorganisation that prevents the cohesion necessary for the cells to constitute an individual body; then one knows, ah! (<em>gesture of dissolution</em>), it is going to be finished. Then the cells aspire, and there is something like a central consciousness of the body which aspires intensely, with a surrender as complete as it can make: "Thy Will, Lord, Thy Will, Thy Will." Then there is a kind of—not anything bursting aloud, not any dazzling flash, but a kind of... yes, it gives the feeling of a condensation of this current of disorganisation, and then something stops; at first a peace, then a light, then the Harmony—and the disorder disappears.

The mind is withdrawn, the vital is withdrawn, all is withdrawn. At the time when I was said to be ill, the mind was gone, the vital was gone, the body was left to itself—purposely. Yes, it is that, it is just because the vital and the mental were gone that it gave the impression of a very serious illness. And then, in the body left to itself, little by little the cells began to wake up to the consciousness (<em>gesture of aspiration rising up</em>); this consciousness that was infused into the body by the vital (from the mental into the vital, from the vital into the body), when both had disappeared, the consciousness emerged slowly, slowly. That started with a burst of the Love from the highest summit, the last supreme altitude, and then little by little, little by little, it came down into the body.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 438">But now a certitude is there.

To enable that to manifest what is within... This will come last, and it is good it is so, for if it came before time, one would neglect the work, one would be so satisfied as to forget to finish his work; everything should be done within, should be well and good, should be thoroughly changed, then the outside will speak it out.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 439">But it is all one single substance, all similar everywhere, and everywhere it was unconscious; and then what is remarkable is that <em>automatically</em> things are happening (<em>gesture showing points scattered everywhere in the world</em>) altogether unexpected, here and there, in people who do not even know anything.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 441">The material cells have to obtain the capacity to receive and to manifest consciousness. And then what makes for a radical transformation is that in place of, so to say, an eternal and indefinite ascent, there is the appearance of a new type — it is a descent from above. The previous descent was a mental descent,</p>
<span id="page_97"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="PE">and this one, Sri Aurobindo calls it a supramental descent; the impression is that of a descent of the supreme Consciousness which infuses itself into something that is capable of receiving it and manifesting it. And then, out of this, when it has been thoroughly churned (how long it will take, one does not know), a new form will take birth, which will be what Sri Aurobindo called the supramental form — which will be... it does not matter what, I do not know what these beings will be called.</p>

That is an experience that I had long, long ago. At the age of twenty I started having experiences like that, therefore I know. I knew how the consciousness works. Well, it is impossible to learn piano or to do painting unless the consciousness enters into the hands and the hands become conscious <em>independently</em> of the head. The head can be busy elsewhere, that has no importance.

That is why the doctor declared that I was ill: I could not move a step without fainting; I wanted to walk from here to there: on the way, pouf! I fainted. Someone had to hold me so that the body would not fall down. But as for me, I did not lose consciousness for a single minute. I fainted, but I was conscious, I saw my body, I knew that I had fainted, I did not lose consciousness, and the body also did not lose consciousness. So now I understand: it was cut off from the vital and the mental and left to its own resources; it was simply the body: all that it knew, all the experiences it had had, all the mastery that was there in all the states of being, the vital, the mental and above, all that gone! and this poor body left to itself.

Perhaps the original consciousness divided into two in a past life (this has happened several times) and was manifested in two different bodies at the same time; and so there has naturally been an intimacy, probably even an intermixing of life — this may be a physical occurrence. But it may also be someone existing in a permanent way, in a permanent form somewhere with whom we are in constant contact in that world (overmental or supramental or other) and the feeling within is: yes, I know.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 492">The body by itself has more than a feeling, a kind of... it is a knowledge — more than a knowledge, it is a fact: there are many, many beings, forces, personalities who manifest themselves through it, even sometimes several at the same time. That is a very common experience; we know, for example, that Sri Aurobindo is there, he speaks and sees, he has his own way of seeing and expressing himself, that happens very often. And then often it is Durga or Mahakali or... very often. Often, it is a being from very high up, very permanent — very permanent — who manifests himself, and then there occurs a kind of absolute in the being.

It was that which my body was feeling when I came out to the balcony.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 497" style="font-style:italic">Mother made the following comment while speaking on the subject of government.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 498">The problem finally reduces itself almost to this: to replace the mental government of intelligence by the government of a spiritualised consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 499">This is a very interesting experience: how the same actions, the same work, the same observations, the same relations with the environment (near and far) take place in the mind through intelligence, and in the consciousness through experience. And this is what the body is now learning, to replace the mental regime of intelligence by the spiritual government of consciousness. And this does bring about (it looks like nothing, you may not notice it), but it does bring about a tremendous difference, so much so that it increases a hundredfold the possibilities of the body.... When the body is subject to rules, even if they are broad, even if they are comprehensive, it is the slave of these rules, and its possibilities are limited by these rules. But when it is governed by the Spirit and the Consciousness, that gives it an incomparable possibility and flexibility. And it is that which will give it the capacity to prolong its life, prolong its duration; it means the replacement of the intellectual government of the mind by the government of the Spirit, of the Consciousness — the Consciousness. Outwardly it does not seem to make much difference, but... my experience is this (because now my body no longer obeys the mind or the intelligence, not at all — it does not even understand how this can be done), but more and more, better and better, it follows the guidance, the urge of the Consciousness. And then it sees, almost every minute, the tremendous difference that this makes.... For example, time has lost its value — its fixed value. Exactly the same thing can be</p>
<span id="page_108"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 108</p>
<p class="PE">done in a short time or a long time. Necessities have lost their authority. One can adapt oneself like this or like that. All the laws, these laws that were laws of Nature, have lost all their despotism, one might say; it is no longer as before. It is enough to be always, always supple, attentive and... “responsive” to the influence of the Consciousness — the Consciousness in its omnipotence — to pass through all that, with an extraordinary suppleness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 500">That is the discovery which is being made more and more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 501">It is wonderful, is it not? It is a wonderful discovery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 502">It is like a progressive victory over all the imperatives. Thus all laws of Nature, naturally, all the human laws, all the habits, all the rules, all that becomes supple and ends by being nonexistent. And yet one can maintain a regular rhythm that facilitates action — it is not contrary to this suppleness. But it is a suppleness in the execution, in the adaptation, that comes in and changes everything. From the point of view of hygiene, from the point of view of health, from the point of view of organisation, from the point of view of relations with others, all that has lost not only its aggressiveness (for it is sufficient to be sane — sane and sober and calm — for it to lose its aggressiveness), but its absolutism, its imperative rule; it is all gone, it is gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 503">So, one sees: as the process becomes more and more perfect—"perfect" means integral, total, leaving nothing behind—it is necessarily, inevitably, the victory over death. Not that the dissolution of cells which death represents does not exist, but it will exist only when it will be necessary: not as an absolute law, but as <em>one</em> of the procedures, when it is necessary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 504">Above all, it is this: all that the Mind has brought of the rigid, the absolute, the almost invincible... will disappear. And simply that, by transferring the supreme power to the Supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 505">Perhaps it is that which the ancient seers meant when they spoke of transferring the power of Nature or the power of Prakriti to Purusha, transferring it from Prakriti to Purusha. It is perhaps that which they expressed in this way.</p>

Is it not to satisfy our logic that we say: All that is obscure, all that is ugly, all that is not living, all that is not harmonious, all that is not divine—but how is it possible?... It is only an attitude for action. Then by placing myself in the consciousness of the action, I said, "But why do You take pleasure in being like that!" (<em>Mother laughs.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 510">It was a very concrete experience of the cells, and with the feeling (not feeling: neither feeling nor sensation), a kind of perception that you are just, just on the border of the great secret.... All of a sudden a whole set of cells or a certain bodily function takes the fancy of going wrong — why? What meaning is there in that? And the response was... it was as though all that helped to break the limits.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 511">But why, how?...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 512">You can explain everything mentally, but that signifies nothing at all: for the body, for the material consciousness it is abstract. The material consciousness, when it seizes something, it knows the thing <em>a hundred times better</em> than one can know it mentally. And when it knows, it has power: this gives the power. And it is this that is worked out slowly, slowly—and for the ignorant consciousness, slowly and painfully. But for the true consciousness, it is not so: pain, delight, all this is a way... so absurd a way of seeing things—of feeling them, seeing them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 513">There is a perception more and more concrete that everything... that there is nothing that does not contain the delight of being, because it is the <em>way</em> of being: without the delight of being, there is no being. But it is not what we understand mentally by the delight of being. It is... something that is difficult to say. And this perception of suffering and delight, almost of evil and good, all this, these are necessities for the work, to allow the work to be done in a certain field of inconscience. Because the true consciousness is something altogether, altogether different. And this, it is this which this consciousness of the cells is now learning, and learning through a concrete experience, and all these evaluations of what is good and what is bad, of what is suffering and what is delight, all this appears vague. But still the Thing—the Truth—the concrete Thing is not yet seized. It is on the way, one feels that it is on the way, but it is not yet that. If one had it... one would be the omnipotent master. And it is possible that one can get it only when the entire world or a sufficient part of it will be ready for transformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 514">This is a speculation, one might call it an inspiration, but it belongs yet to the domain high above.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 515">From time to time, it is as though one just touched upon the perception of the all-power: one is just on the point, ah! (<em>Mother makes a gesture of catching the thing</em>)... but off it goes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 516">When one will have that, the world will be able to change. And when I say “one”, I do not speak of a person.... There</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 518">So then there, there is only That; and it is That which has Power.

And this morning, it was the discovery of the Separation this Separation which has been described in all sorts of different ways, sometimes as a story, sometimes merely in an abstract manner, sometimes philosophically, sometimes... all this, these are only explanations, but there is something, which probably is simply the Objectivisation (<em>Mother makes a gesture of pushing the universe out, out of the Non-manifest</em>), but this also is a way of explaining.

(<em>Mother remains absorbed for a long time</em>). Words fail. One could say like this (it is dry and lifeless): It is the consciousness of the unity of the whole felt in the individual—felt, lived, realised. But that is nothing, these are nothing but words.... The universe seems to have been created to realise this paradox of the consciousness of the whole, living (not merely perceived but lived) in every part, in every element constituting the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 525">Then as to the formation of these elements, it began by the Separation and it is the Separation which gave birth to this division between that one calls the good and the bad; but from the point of view of sensation — sensation in the most material part — one can say it is suffering and Ananda. The movement then is to stop all separation and realise the total consciousness in every part — which is from the mental point of view an absurdity, but it is like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 526">For my taste it is much too philosophical, it is not sufficiently concrete; but the experience of this morning was concrete, and</p>
<span id="page_114"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 114</p>
<p class="PE">it was concrete because it came out of extremely concrete sensations in the body, of the presence of this constant duality (in appearance), of an opposition (not merely opposition but the negation of the one by the other) between... we may take as a symbol suffering and Ananda. And the true state — which it seems impossible to formulate in words for the moment, but which was lived and felt — is a totality containing all, but instead of containing all as elements confronting one another, it is a harmony of all, an equilibrium of all. And when this equilibrium will be realised in the creation, this creation will be able to... (if words are spoken, it is no longer that) one could say: continue to progress without rupture (it is not that).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 527">There was also seen in the present imperfect consciousness, these days, repeatedly (but all that, methodical and organised through an organisation of the whole infinitely superior to any we can imagine), a state which is the one determining the rupture of equilibrium, that is to say, the dissolution of the form, what is usually called “death”, and this state up to its extreme limit, as a demonstration — along with, at the same time, the state (not the perception but the state) preventing this rupture of equilibrium and permitting the continuity of the progress without rupture. And this gives in the body consciousness the simultaneous (so to say, simultaneous) perception of what one might call the extreme agony of dissolution (although it is not quite that, but still) and then the extreme Ananda of union — the two simultaneous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 528">Thus, translated in ordinary words: extreme frailty — more than frailty — of the form, and the eternity of the form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 529">And it is not merely union, but the fusion, the identification of the two which is the Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 530">When it is mentalised, it becomes clear for everybody — it loses its essential quality, something that cannot be mentalised.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 531">Not divided. It is the union of the two states which makes the true consciousness, the union of the two — “union” still implies division — the identification of the two which makes the true consciousness. And then one has the feeling that it is that, it is that consciousness, which is the supreme Power. Power is limited by oppositions and negations, is it not? — the most powerful power is the one that dominates most; but it is wholly an imperfection. There is, however, an all-powerful Power which is made of the fusion of the two. That is absolute Power. And if That was realised physically... probably it would be the end of the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 532">Indeed, during the few hours I lived like that this morning, the feeling was that everything has been mastered and everything understood — and “understood” in that way of comprehension which makes the power absolute. But naturally that cannot be said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 533">It is that which people who must have had the experience or a touch of the experience translated by saying that this world was the world of equilibrium: that is to say, it is the simultaneity, without division, of all contraries.

And whatever is not that state cannot be eternal; it is that state alone which... not merely contains but expresses (or what?) the eternity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 569" style="text-align:center"><em>"Powerful and prolonged penetration of supramental forces into the body,<br/> everywhere at the same time..."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 570">Penetration into the body. Yes, penetration of the current, I had had on many occasions, but that night (that is to say, the night before last), it came all of a sudden, as though there was nothing but a supramental atmosphere; there was nothing but that. And my body was within it. That was <em>pressing</em> to enter, from everywhere, everywhere, everywhere at the same time—everywhere. So it was not a current that was entering, it was an atmosphere that penetrated from everywhere. That continued for at least four or five hours. And there was only one part that was <em>hardly</em> penetrated, it was from here to there (<em>Mother indicates between the throat and the crown of the head</em>): there, it had a grey and dull look, as though the current penetrated less there.... But apart from that, all the rest, all... it entered and entered and entered.... I never, never saw anything like <em>it</em>, never! It lasted for hours and hours. Altogether consciously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 571">So, at the time when it came and during the time it was there, I was conscious: "Ah, it is for that, it is for that: it is that, it is that which You want of me, O Lord! It is for that, it is for that, it is that which You want." At that moment I had the feeling that <em>something</em> was about to happen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 572">I hoped for its return this night, but nothing came about. It was the first time. For hours. There was nothing else but That. And this (Mother’s body), it was like an absorbing sponge. Only the head, it is still grey, dull — grey and dull. But then, all the same, a very clear vision of whatever has happened to the body during these few months, and... almost a hope. Almost a hope, it is as though someone told me that something could happen here. That’s all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 573">And this, it was as though an answer to what the body had said (perhaps two or three days back), what I told you in the</p>

<p class="PE">beginning: that it was quite ready to get dissolved (it is a perfect surrender) and it was quite ready to continue to live, under any circumstances whatever, but not in that condition. Not in that condition of decomposition. To that, however, there was no answer for two days, and then there came this Penetration. That is to say, the very next day I began to feel a little better, I could begin to... I could not even remain standing! I did not have the sense of balance; someone had to hold me. I had lost the sense of balance, I could not take a step. It was there that I protested. And from the next morning it began to recover.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 574">Then came the 23rd. I saw X and I noticed that when he was there the body was quite interested; no, it was not the mental or the vital: they had left! I do not know if you are able to realise what that means.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Yes, it is fantastic.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 575">A body without the mind, without the vital. It was in that condition when X came in. There were only these perceptions (towns, buildings, temples), it lived in soul states: there were the soul states of others, the soul states of the earth, the soul states... Soul states that were translated by images. It was interesting. I cannot say it was not interesting; it was interesting, but there was no contact with material life, very little: I could hardly eat, hardly walk... in short, it was something with which one had to busy oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 576">And then, at the contact of X, the body began to be interested in all that, to put questions quite spontaneously, it did not know why. It asked and asked: “Well, it is in that way that one is made...” So it began to amuse itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 577">It will take a little time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 578">When this Penetration came, the day before yesterday, I said to myself: “Ah!” I hoped that the curve would get accelerated and one would come out soon, but this night there was nothing. That makes me say that it will take some time more.</p>

After having looked at it, I came to the conclusion that it is impossible to reproach a human being who does as well as he can according to his consciousness, for how can he go beyond his consciousness?... This is just the error that the majority of people make: they judge one another according to their own consciousness, but the other has not their consciousness! Therefore they cannot judge (I speak only of people of goodwill, naturally). According to the vision of a more total or higher consciousness, another person deceives himself, but according to the person himself, he does to the utmost whatever he believes he must do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 601">This amounts to saying that it is absolutely impossible to lay the blame upon anyone who acts sincerely according to his own limited consciousness. And in fact, if we come to that, everyone in the world has a limited consciousness, excepting <em>the</em> Consciousness. It is only <em>the</em> Consciousness which is not limited. But every manifestation is necessarily limited, unless it comes out of itself and unites itself with the supreme Consciousness, then there... In what conditions can that be done?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 602">It is the problem of identification with the Supreme, which is the Supreme One — One which is All.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 604">There is a whole side of human thought that has the conception that identification with the supreme Consciousness can come only by annulling the individual creation, but Sri Aurobindo precisely has said that it is possible without abolishing the creation.

<p class="PE">man, but it is possible for the supramental being. And it is this that will make the supramental being essentially different: he will be able, without losing a limited form, to unite his consciousness with the supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 605">But for man, it is impossible. That I know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 606">As I have said, you have it, you have the experience, but as soon as you want to express it, it is gone, it becomes again... (<em>gesture of being closed</em>). That is to say, the substance of which we are built up is not sufficiently purified, enlightened, transformed (it does not matter what word) to express the supreme Consciousness without deforming it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 607" style="text-align:center">(<em>Silence. Mother enters into an experience.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 608">It is a certain opacity in Matter, in the substance that makes it unable to manifest the Consciousness... and it is this same (I do not know how to say it) opacity that gives it the sense of existing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 609">This is part of the experience of these last days. I have lived for... I do not know, for weeks, in a kind of fluidity — transparent fluidity — and as this transparent fluidity is replaced by this something that I call now “opacity”, there comes a kind of concretisation of the existence of the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 610">So, the direct contact of the psychic being with the substance of the body, without any intermediary, gives the sensation... is it a “sensation”? I do not know; it is not a sensation, it is not a perception; it is a kind of “felt vision” (and this vision is very precise, very precise) of the value of vibrations in relation to a higher vibration which is (all that I can say about it) more directly the expression of the supreme Vibration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 611">It is very difficult to express, but the body is going through an experience which it never had; it is as though passing from an imprecision to a precision, from a kind of fluidity to... it is not a concrete thing, but from a thing fluid — fluid and imprecise — to a thing precise. All the happenings (no matter how small), which</p>
<span id="page_132"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 132</p>
<p class="PE">vary, are the occasion for a new perception. Before, everything was fluid and imprecise; now it is beginning to be more precise — more precise, more exact. But it loses a little of its fluidity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 612">It is very difficult to express.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 613">I had never thought of it. It is strange, it is not willed. Just now I have had the experience. So it is not yet very clear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 614">Indeed, the mind gives a precision that is lacking when it is not there. Its role in creation is just to give precision, to explain, and at the same time to limit.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>An ordinary mind could ask: "But what is the advantage of this imprecision?"</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 615">There is no advantage!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 616">It is altogether certain that when the Supramental manifests, it will replace the mental precision (how to say it?) that diminishes — the precision that limits and therefore falsifies things in part — by a clarity of vision, another kind of vision that does not diminish. It is that which is being built up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 617">Indeed, it can be said (it is not exactly this): in order to give precision, the mind limits and separates; and evidently there is a precision that can come from a more exact vision, without division and without separation. And it is that precision which will be the precision of the supramental vision. With the precision will come, at the same time, the vision of the <em>relation</em> of all things to one another, without separating them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 618">But that is something in preparation. It comes as a flash, for aminute, and then lapses back into its old way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 619">The same can be said of the vital. The vital gives an intensity which nothing else seems capable of giving; well, this same intensity exists in the Supramental, but without division. It is an intensity that does not separate.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 621">I have had an interesting experience.... Not last night, but the night before, someone, whom I shall not name, told me, "I am wholly down in the physical consciousness: no more meditation, and the Divine has become something up there, so far away." Then immediately, as he was speaking, the whole room got filled with the divine Presence. I told him, "Not up there: <em>here</em>, here itself." And at that moment, <em>everything</em>, the whole atmosphere... it was as though the air had changed into the divine Presence (<em>Mother touches her hands, her face, her body</em>), well, everything was touched, touched, pervaded, but with... the thing that was particularly there was a dazzling Light, a Peace like this (<em>gesture of massiveness</em>), a Power, and then a Sweetness... something... one had the feeling that it could melt a rock.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 622">And it did not go away. It stayed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 623">It came in that way, and then it stayed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 624">And so the whole night it was like that—everything. Even now, the two are there: a little of the ordinary consciousness, as if in a mechanical way, but I have only to be quiet or concentrated for a moment and it is there. And it is the experience of the <em>body</em>, you understand, physical, material, the experience of the body: everything, everything is full, full; there is only <em>That</em>, and we are like... everything is as though shrivelled, a dried up rind, something like that, dried up. One has the feeling that things are (not entirely, but superficially) hardened, dried up, and that is why you do not feel That. That is why you do not feel Him; otherwise, all is That, That, there is <em>nothing but</em> That. You cannot breathe without breathing Him in; you move, it is within Him that you move; you are... everything, everything, the whole universe is within Him—but <em>materially</em>, physically, physically.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 625">It is the cure for this “drying up” that I am now looking for. I feel it is something fantastic, do you understand?</p>
<span id="page_134"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 134</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 626">And then when I listen, He tells me things also. I said to Him, “But then why do people always go up there?” And with the most extraordinarily unusual humour the answer comes: “Because they want me to be very far from their consciousness!” Things like that, but not formulated in such a precise manner: impressions only. Many a time — many — I had heard: “Why do they go so far in search of what is” — of course there are tenets that said: It is within you — “what is everywhere?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 627">I did not say it to this person, first because the experience was not, as it is now, a continuous thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 628">And then there was this particularly: <em>no new religions</em>, no dogmas, no fixed teachings. One must avoid—one must avoid at all cost the thing becoming a new religion. Because as soon as it is formulated in a way that is elegant and imposing and has a force, <em>it would be the end</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 629">You have the feeling that He is everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere; there is nothing else. And we do not know it because we are... shrunken, I do not know how to say it, dried up. We have made great efforts (<em>Mother laughs</em>) to separate ourselves—and succeeded! Succeeded, but succeeded only in our consciousness, not in fact. In fact, It is there. It is there. There is <em>nothing but</em> That. Whatever we know, whatever we see, whatever we touch, it is as though bathing, floating in That; but it is penetrable; it is penetrable, quite penetrable: That passes through it. The sense of separation comes from this (<em>Mother touches her forehead, indicating the mind</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 630">The experience came, perhaps, because for several days there was a very great concentration to find out, not exactly the why or the how, but the fact, the fact of the separation, everything appearing so stupid, so ugly.... I was assailed, assailed by various living memories of all kinds of experiences (all kinds: books, pictures, cinemas, and life, people, things), memories of this body, all the memories that might be called “anti-divine”, in which the body had the sensation of something that was repulsive or evil, like negations of the divine</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 631"> Presence. It began in that way; for two days I was like that, so much so that the body almost sank into despair. And then the experience came and after that it did not move. It did not budge. It came: brrff! finished, and it did not budge. Well, the experiences come and then they withdraw: it did not move. At this moment it is there. And then the body tries to be fluid (<em>Mother makes a gesture of pouring herself out</em>), it tries to melt; it tries, it understands what it is. It tries—it does not succeed, evidently! (<em>Mother looks at her hands</em>), but its consciousness knows.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 632">Only, the experience has its effects: people have felt relief all of a sudden; one or two were completely cured. And when something goes wrong in the body, it need not ask: quite naturally it is set right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 633">And that has not even given to the body the need to do nothing and be wholly concentrated upon its experience: no, there is no desire, nothing at all. Like this, to float in a luminous immensity... which is within! It is not only outside: it is within. It is within. That (<em>Mother touches her hands</em>), that which appears as separate, truly the feeling is that it is... I do not know how to say it, but it is real only in the distortion of the consciousness, but not the human consciousness: something has happened, something has happened in the consciousness....

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 636">But it is difficult to say. I have had days when I have lived truly all the horrors of creation (and in the consciousness of their horror), and then that has brought this experience, and... all the horror has disappeared.</p>

And it was physical, altogether physical, with a physical reason. Yes, the doctors would say, “It is because of this, because of that and that”, quite a material thing, altogether physical; and pouf! it goes away.... The consciousness changes and back it comes.</p>

And this is becoming more and more clear from the general point of view, and it applies it, it applies this to itself; that is to say, a work is being done so that all parts of the body may become conscious, not merely conscious of the forces received, of the forces passing through it, but also of the action of its inner functioning.</p>

Yes, it is that. It is a very small beginning. But it has begun. It has begun to be a bit conscious. And not only for itself alone, but for others also, it has begun: to see how, to perceive in what way the Consciousness (with a capital C) acts in others; and sometimes indeed (the words follow <em>long after</em> the experience) there is no longer the perception of division; there is the perception of diversity and this becomes very interesting....

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 671">Certainly it acts, it has <em>already</em> acted for a long time.

It is for that, so that the thing would go faster. In people it is through the mind and the vital that That acts, but I have said it was also more sure. As an experience this is rather risky.

So for a time, it is left to this imagination (this is what has happened these days) and when it is completely tired of this stupid activity, it prays, yes, with all its intensity, so that the thing may stop. Immediately, just that, hop! it does this (<em>gesture</em>), it turns around straightaway and goes into a contemplation—not distant, but quite close—of this wonderful Presence that is everywhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 675">It is like this, like this (<em>Mother quickly turns two fingers</em>), it does not take time, there is no preparation or anything; it is hop! hop! in this way (<em>same gesture</em>), as though to show the stupidity of the body. It is something altogether idiotic, like a demonstration through evidence of the stupidity of the body left to itself, and then of this wonderful Consciousness that comes, in which all that vanishes... like something which has no consistency, no reality, and which vanishes. And like a proof that it is not merely in the imagination, but that it is in the <em>fact</em>: proof of the power so that all this... vain dream of life as it is (which has become for the consciousness of this body something so frightful) can be changed into a wonder, like this, simply by the reversal of the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 676">The experience is repeated in all the details, in all the domains, as a demonstration through fact. And it is not a "long process" of transformation, it is as though something is reversed all of a sudden (<em>Mother turns two fingers</em>), and instead of seeing ugliness, falsehood, suffering and all that, suddenly it lives in bliss. And all the things are the same, nothing has moved, except the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 677">And so there remains (it is what lies in front, what is probably coming): how is the experience to be translated materially?... For the body itself, it is quite evident: during, say, one hour, or two or three, it suffered much, it was quite miserable (not a moral suffering, an altogether physical suffering), and then all of a sudden, brrff! all gone!... The body apparently has</p>

<p class="PE"> remained the same (<em>Mother looks at her hands</em>) in its appearance, but in place of an inner disorder which makes it suffer, everything is going well and there is a great peace, a great calm, and everything is going well. But this, it is for one body—how does it act upon others? It begins to notice the possibility in other consciousnesses. From the moral point of view (that is to say, in respect to attitudes and character and reactions), it is quite visible; even from the physical point of view sometimes: all of a sudden something disappears—as we had the experience when Sri Aurobindo removed a pain (<em>gesture as if a hand comes and takes away the pain</em>): one wondered... "Ah! gone, vanished, like that." But it is not constant, not general, it is only to show that it can be so, by the fact that it is so in one case or another, to show that it can be like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 678">One might say it in this way: the body has the feeling that it is imprisoned within something — yes, imprisoned — imprisoned as though in a box, but it sees through; it sees and it can also act (in a limited way) through something which is still there and which must disappear. This “something” gives the feeling of an imprisonment. How is it to disappear? That I do not know yet.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 679">One has to find the relation between the consciousness in <em>one</em> body and the consciousness of all. And to what extent there is dependence and to what extent there is independence, that is to say, up to what point the body can be transformed in its consciousness (and as a result, necessarily, in its appearance) without... without the transformation of all—up to what point? And to what extent the transformation of all is necessary for the transformation of one body. This remains to be discovered.</p>

It was something very material, I mean it was very external—very external—and it was luminous, with a golden light. It was very strong, very powerful; but even so, its character was a smiling benevolence, a peaceful delight and a kind of opening out into delight and light.

It would seem that the most conclusive and obvious aspect [of the supramental] and the one which will probably be the first to manifest — probably — will be the aspect of Power, rather than the aspect of Joy or of Truth. For a new race to be founded on earth, it would necessarily have to be protected from other earthly elements in order to be able to survive; and power is protection — not an artificial power, external and false, but the true strength, the triumphant Will. It is therefore not impossible to think that the supramental action, even before being an action of harmonisation, illumination, joy and beauty, might be an action of power, to serve as a protection. Naturally, for this action of power to be truly effective, it would have to be founded on Knowledge and Truth and Love and Harmony; but these things could manifest, visibly, little by little, when the ground, so to say, has been prepared by the action of a sovereign Will and Power.” (18 December 1957)</p>

Itself, it is like this (<em>gesture of self-abandon, palms opened upward</em>); it says, "What Thou willest, Lord." But then, the body knows that it has been decided and it is not to be told to it. It accepts, it is not impatient, it accepts, it says, "It is all right, it shall be what Thou willest." But That which knows and That which does not respond is... something that cannot be expressed. It is... yes, I believe the only word that describes the sensation one has, is: it is an Absolute—an Absolute. Absolute. It is that, the sensation: of being in the presence of the Absolute. The Absolute: absolute Knowledge, absolute Will, absolute Power.... Nothing, nothing can resist it. And then, it is an Absolute which is (one has this kind of sensation, concrete) of compassion! But by the side of that, all that we consider as kindness, compassion... pooh! it is nothing at all. That is Compassion with power absolute, and... it is not Wisdom, it is not Knowledge, it is... It has nothing to do with our procedure. And it is That, everywhere. That is everywhere. And it is the experience of the body; and to That, the body gives itself entirely, totally, asking for nothing, nothing at all.

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>"It is only immutable peace that can make possible eternity of existence."</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 769">I remember I wrote this after having had the experience that the immobility of the Inconscient, the beginning of creation, is, one cannot say a "projection", but a kind of inanimate or inconscient symbol of the Eternity, of the Immobility—it is not "immobility", words are worth nothing, it is between immobility and stability. I have written here "peace", but "peace" is a poor word, it is not that, it is infinitely more than peace, it is the "something" (even the word "eternal" gives a limited sense, all words are impossible), the "Something" which is the Origin of all things and the beginning of the evolution of the manifestation to rejoin the Origin (<em>Mother draws a curve joining the one to the other</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 770">I have the impression that it was at the Playground, and it was as though the inconscient immobility—the immobility of the Inconscient, the inert immobility of the Inconscient—were the starting-point of the evolution and it was like the <em>translation</em> of this... how to say it? (this is also another kind of immobility! but an immobility containing all movements) of this immobility of the Origin, this stability, and that the whole evolution is so that this may find back That, with the whole passage (<em>same gesture of a great curve</em>). It was a very clear vision. I remember having written this, and when I read it the experience came back. Well, we speak always of a "fall"—but it is not that! It is not at all that. If there is a fall, it is at the moment when the vital turned into a will for independence: it is not at the beginning, it occurs altogether on the way.... In the ancient tradition, they</p>
<span id="page_163"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 163</p>
<p class="PE">say it is the “Conscient” that became the Inconscient because it was “cut off from the Origin” — this gives me the impression of stories told to children.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 771">It is curious, in the silence and in the vision, it is very clear and very luminous, understandable; but as soon as you want to tell it, it becomes foolish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 772">But then, in the creation even as it is now, it is true that the word “peace” is perhaps the nearest (although it is not that, it is quite small and restricted, it is not that). As soon as something goes wrong or out of order, it is that which comes as the remedy, within.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 774">Oh! Words are worth nothing, I do not know what to do, I do not know if it is because I have not enough of them or because truly... all mental expression seems artificial. It gives the feeling of a lifeless film. It is curious. And all language belongs to that domain. When I want to relate this experience... with some people I enter into a relation very, very well, very easily, in silence, and I tell them infinitely more things than I would be able to with words; it is more supple, more exact, more profound.... Well! Words, phrases, things written leave me with the impression of a two-dimensional picture, the ordinary picture; and that, that contact which I have in a way with people when I do not talk, that adds the depth and something more true (it is not, it is far from being altogether true, but it is more true) and there is a depth.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 776">That is why the experiences are difficult to recount. They are no longer separate experiences which come one after another; it is like a single and global movement (<em>circular gesture</em>) of transformation, and it has a great intensity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 777">In the ordinary functioning of life, there is this feeling that "it goes well", which is translated in people as a feeling of good health, and then there is a lack of balance, lack of order; and this opposition now seems <em>altogether</em> artificial: it is only a continuous movement which changes over from one kind of vibration to another kind whose origin is much more (how to say it? it is not "deeper", it is not "higher", and "truer" gives only one side, it is not that), well, "superior" in some way—words are foolish, altogether foolish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 778">It is like this, it is all the time like this. And then one is drawn to one spot or to another; it is simply a play of our consciousness, but for the consciousness that sees the whole, it is a continuous movement, and a global one towards... yes, it is this, it is in order that this inert Inconscient becomes the absolute Conscient.... I do not know, I have a vague impression that it has been discovered (here, absolutely on the earth, upon the earth), it has been discovered that a certain intensity of movement (that is to say, what we call “rapidity”) is translated by an impression of immobility. I have a vague impression that I have been told so. But this corresponds to something. What I have called “peace” in the message, what is felt as peace, is an acme of movement, but general — harmonious and general.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 785">But precisely this message, when it was read out to me, brought back the experience; therefore I know how it was, and then the word “peace” contained so much!... Now it is no longer there.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 788">Yes, and then the experience was that this same immutable peace (which was neither"peace" nor "immutable"! but it was "something"), this very Thing was there within the inconscient inertia.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 791">These notions about individuality... they are very much changed for me, very much. Even the whole of this morning... But for a long time, for at least a month, it has been different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 792">When people speak of individuality, there is always as though... at least in the background, some separation, that is to say, something existing independently and having its own destiny. But now, as the consciousness in this body knows it, it is almost like a pulsation of "something" which <em>for the moment</em> has a separate action, but is at bottom, in essence always one; as something which is projected like this (<em>gesture of expansion</em>) for the moment with a form, and then which can (<em>gesture of contraction</em>), can at will annul this form. It is very difficult to explain, but in any case the feeling of the permanence of the separation has disappeared altogether. The universe is an exteriorisation (<em>same gesture of pulsation</em>) of the Supreme Consciousness; it is our incapacity for a total vision which gives us the sense of fixity; it is not there, it is something like pulsations or... in fact, it is a play of forms—there is only <em>one</em> Being. There is only one Being, only one, only one Consciousness, only one Being. The separation, it is truly... I do not know what has happened. And it is this that has done all the mischief—all the unhappiness, all the misery.... This body has just passed, for some days, through a series of experiences (too long to narrate), through all the states of consciousness that one can pass through, starting from the sense of the sole reality of that (<em>Mother pinches her skin with her hand</em>), of the substance, with all the miseries, all the suffering resulting from the belief that Matter is the sole reality; from that up to the liberation. It has been, hour after hour, a labour.</p>
<span id="page_167"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 167</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 793">But even before this, the consciousness of the cells had realised the unity, the <em>true</em> essential unity, which <em>could</em> become total if this sort of illusion disappeared. Indeed, the illusion that created this misery was lived so intensely that it became almost unbearable, with all the horrors and frightfulnesses created by it in the human consciousness and upon earth.... There had been things... frightful. And just after—just after—the liberation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 794">What still remains to be lived, that is to say, the experience still to be realised is... the next forward move of creation, of Matter — the next step to return to the true Consciousness. That, it is...</p>

It was quite interesting. There were games, there was art, there was even cooking! But all that was very symbolic. And I was explaining to him as though on a table, in front of a vast landscape. I was explaining to him the principle on which physical exercises and games were going to be organised. It was very clear, very precise, I was giving as though a demonstration, and it was as though I was showing on a very small scale a miniature representation of what was going to be done. I was moving people and things (<em>gesture, as though on a chess-board</em>). But it was very interesting, and he was very much interested: he was laying down the broad laws of organisation (I do not know how to explain). There was art and it was beautiful, it was good. And how to make the houses pleasant and pretty, upon what principle of construction. And then even the kitchen; it was so amusing, each one brought forward his invention.... This went on for three hours—three hours of the night, it is a lot! Very interesting.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-177-1">
        The reference is to a book by Frantz Fanon, <em>The Wretched of the Earth</em>, the central theme of which is: violence alone pays. "The practice of violence binds men together as a whole, since each individual forms a violent link in the great chain, a part of the great organism of violence which has surged upward." This book has been prefaced by Jean-Paul Sartre, who says still more clearly: "Irrepressible violence... is man recreating himself." It is the "mad fury" through which "the wretched of the earth" can "become men". "To shoot down a European is to kill two birds with one stone... there remains a dead man and a free man."<br/>

And at the <em>same time</em> I was in the state of true consciousness: his solution and the true one. It was really interesting. How the Buddhist solution is only <em>one</em> step taken—one step.

And we are all in the Falsehood and Unreality; that is why it is like that. And what was interesting was that this escape into Nirvana was not the solution, was only a remedy, a remedy for a time (how to explain? I do not know), partial.

They are all at different levels, but all are worth <em>nothing</em>. And then, after that, at the time when you really have the feeling of an everlasting hell, all of a sudden... (nothing but a state of consciousness, it is nothing else but that), all of a sudden a state of consciousness... in which all is light, splendour, beauty, happiness, goodness... and everything inexpressible. And it is like that: "There, there you are", and then, pfft! it appears and then, hop! off it goes.

There is some sense that that<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="184-1" href="#">1</a> would be a wonderful solution. When you said it, something became concrete all of a sudden. But there was no personal sense within... the body has none at all, at all, no ambition or desire whatsoever or even aspiration to become that, but there was only a kind of delight in the possibility of "that" being done; if it were done, it matters not who or where or how: only let that be done. And I looked at it with very, very close attention; not for a moment was there the idea: "It must be this" (<em>Mother pinches her skin with her fingers</em>), you understand? It was: "Let there be this incarnation, this manifestation"—not to choose one person or another, one place or another, no, nothing of that kind existed: it was the thing in itself which was like a wonderful solution.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 896">And then the consciousness began to observe: if there is nothing in this body which “aspired” to be that, it proves that this is not its work.

(one could translate it in quite a childlike manner): “It is not your business!” And that’s all. And then it was finished, I was not busy with it any more. “Not your business” in the sense: this does not concern you; whether it is this or that or that, it is not your business. That is all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 897">But what has become its business—in such an intense way that it cannot be expressed—is: "Thou, Thou, Thou, Thou."

I say, "It is possible"; it is a fact. Only, what is needed... what prevents it generally is that the physical consciousness in most men is very obscure; it is made only of the most material needs, desires, reactions. But what is needed is to awaken in the cells the love for the Divine; it is always so, all the time, and it does not change, does not change any more. It is even <em>much more</em> constant than any mental or vital movement; it is like this (<em>Mother closes both her fists</em>), it does not move. The cells are all the while like this, in a state of love for the Divine. What is most remarkable in the physical is that once it has learnt a thing it never forgets it. The cells, once they have learnt it, this self-giving, this offering to the Divine, this <em>need</em> of self-offering, have learnt it for good; it does not flicker any more. It is constant, twenty-four hours out of twenty-four, without stop and day after day, and there is no change. Even if there be something that is not all right (either a pain or something else), the first movement, yes, it is that, it is to offer itself, give itself—spontaneously. The higher consciousness does not intervene. It is spontaneous, it is</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 191</p>
<p class="PE"> the consciousness contained in the cells. It is the vital and the mental that are unstable in that way (<em>gesture of zigzagging</em>). Particularly, particularly it is the vital that is interested in all sorts of things. Naturally, the two are interdependent.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 938">For a <em>perfect</em> realisation, the whole being must be illumined; but for the beginning of a realisation, it is probably easier for a body that does not possess a very developed mind.... For us, well, who have reached the maximum possibility of the mind, it is through the maximum that we have gone beyond: it is only when the mind had realised its maximum that it abdicated. And this is quite all right for the integral realisation, but generally the body is too much used to obeying the mind, it is not supple enough to be transformed. And that is why my mind has been sent away.... But that is a method which others cannot be encouraged to follow. For out of ten nine would die.</p>

I see that each time there is a pressure for acting upon one part of the body or another, the thing begins by an absolute passivity—which is... the "perfection of inertia". You understand? It is the perfection of that which inertia represents as imperfect... something that has no activity</p>

<p class="PE"> of its own. It is just the <em>most</em> difficult thing for those who have a very well—developed mind, very difficult. Because the whole body has worked all its life for being just in this state of receptivity to the mind, which makes it obedient, passive, etc., and it is that which must be abolished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 943">How to explain?... The development through mind means a constant and general awakening of the whole being, even the most material, an awakening as a result of which there is also something quite opposite to sleep. And to receive the Supreme Force, one must have, on the contrary, the equivalent of immobility—the immobility of sleep, <em>but absolutely conscious</em>, absolutely conscious. The body feels the difference. It feels the difference to such an extent that... for example, I stretch myself in the evening and I remain like that, for hours together I remain so; and if after a time I fall into ordinary sleep, my body wakes up in a terrible anguish! And then it begins again to put itself back into that state. This anguish I feel from time to time—and it goes away as soon as it gets back into the true attitude, which is a state of immobility, but absolutely conscious. "Immobility", I do not know how to say it.... But it is almost the opposite of the inertia in immobility.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 944">And it is that which is making me understand now the reason why creation began with inertia. And so, that state had to be rediscovered (<em>Mother describes a big curve</em>) after having gone through all the states of consciousness. And it is that which has given us...

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 948">It is difficult to say, because I am convinced that each one has his own way, but for this body the way is to have this active aspiration.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 950">Yes, they are together. That is what it succeeded in getting: a complete immobility and an <em>intense</em> aspiration. It is only when immobility is there without the aspiration that it falls into a frightful anguish which wakes it up immediately. It is that, an intense aspiration. And it is absolutely immobile, immobile within, as though all the cells became immobile.... It must be that. What we call intense aspiration must be the supramental vibration. It must be the divine vibration, the true divine vibration. That I have said to myself often.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 951">But if, even for a single minute, the body falls into the state of inertia — immobility without aspiration — it is awakened by an</p>

And the feeling is that only the body—receptive, open, in any case partially transformed—is capable of having the understanding. Understanding the creation, what we call creation: why and how, the two things.

And I understand why there have been people, there have been Yogis who spoke of the unreality of the world; because, to the consciousness of immortality, the consciousness of mortality is an unreal absurdity. It is like this (<em>Mother passes the fingers of one hand into the fingers of the other, indicating a coming and going of the two consciousnesses</em>). So it is like this at one moment and like that at another. And the other state, the state of immortality, is immutably peaceful, tranquil, with... like staggeringly rapid waves, so rapid that they seem immobile. It is like that—nothing moves (apparently) in a tremendous Movement.

Because there came a day when many problems had cropped up as a consequence of something that had happened, then this morning (towards the end of the night), I had the experience that was the explanation. And for two hours I lived in an absolutely clear perception (not a thought: a clear perception) of the why and how of creation. It was so luminous, so clear; it was irrefutable. It lasted at least for four or five hours and then it petered out; gradually the experience diminished in intensity and clarity.... I had just seen many people, then... it is difficult to explain now. But all had become so limpid; all the contrary theories, everything was at the bottom (<em>Mother looks from above</em>), and all the explanations, all that Sri Aurobindo had said and also some things that Thَeon had said were seen as a consequence of the experience: each thing in its place and absolutely clear.

<p class="pg-num">Page 200</p>
<p class="PE"> by someone who said that creation is separation): for example, night and day, black and white, good and evil, etc., etc.—all that, but it is our explanation. The whole of it, all together is a perfect unity, immutable and... indissoluble. Creation means separation of all that constitutes this unity—one might call it the division of consciousness. The division of consciousness starts from the unity conscious of its unity, in order to arrive at the unity conscious of its multiplicity <em>in the unity</em>. And then it is this path which, because of its fragments, is translated for us by space and time. For us, such as we are, it is possible for each point of this consciousness to be conscious of itself <em>and</em> conscious of the original Unity. And that is the work which is being done; that is to say, each infinitesimal element of this consciousness, while keeping this state of consciousness, is in the process of rediscovering the state of the total original consciousness—and the result is the original Consciousness conscious of its unity <em>and</em> conscious of the whole play, conscious of the innumerable elements of this Unity. This for us is translated into the sense of time: moving from the Inconscient up to this state of Consciousness. And the Inconscient is the projection of the first Unity (if one can say it; all these words are altogether senseless), of the essential unity which is only conscious of its unity—yes, that is the Inconscient. And this Inconscient becomes more and more conscious in beings who are conscious of their infinitesimal existence and <em>at the same time</em>, through what we call progress or evolution or transformation, become conscious of the original Unity.

And for the beginnings (are they the beginnings?), what is called in English the outskirts, what is farthest from the central realisation, that becomes the multiplicity of things, and the multiplicity also of sensations, of feelings, of all... the multiplicity of consciousness. It is this act of separation that has created, that is creating the world constantly and that is creating everything at the same time: suffering, happiness, everything, everything that is created through this... what might be called "diffusion"; but it is absurd, it is not a diffusion—we ourselves live in the sense of space, so we speak of diffusion and concentration, but it is nothing of the sort.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1001">All human reactions, even the highest, the purest, the noblest, appeared so childish!... There is a sentence written by Sri Aurobindo somewhere that was coming all the while to me. One day, I do not remember where, he had written something, a rather long sentence in which there was this: “And when I feel jealous, I know that the old man is still there.” It is now perhaps more than thirty years since I read it — yes, almost thirty years — and I remember, when I read “jealous”, I said to myself: How can Sri Aurobindo be jealous? And so after thirty</p>

<p class="PE"> years I have understood what he meant by being "jealous"—it is not at all what men call "jealous", it was altogether another state of consciousness. I saw it clearly. And this morning it came back to me: "And when I feel jealous, I know that the old man is still there." To be "jealous" for him did not mean what we call "jealous"... It is this infinitesimal particle that we call the individual, this particle of infinitesimal consciousness which places itself at the centre, which is the centre of the perception, and which consequently perceives things coming like that (<em>gesture towards oneself</em>) or going like that (<em>gesture outward</em>) and all that does not come to it gives it a kind of perception that Sri Aurobindo called "jealous": the perception that things are going towards diffusion, instead of coming in towards centralisation; it was that which he called "jealous". So he said: When I feel jealous (this was what he meant to say), I know that the old man is still there; that is to say, this infinitesimal particle of consciousness can <em>still</em> be at the centre of itself; it is the centre of action, the centre of perception, the centre of sensation....</p>

It was frightful!... And all that is gone. It is gone completely after so many years, so many years of effort, it is gone; and the body itself felt the divine Presence, it had the impression that... all must necessarily change. And then, some days ago this formation that had left (which is an earthly formation, of all humanity, that is to say, of those who had the vision, the perception, even only the aspiration for the higher Truth—when they come back to the Fact, they stand before this terribly painful thing, this ceaseless negation of all circumstances), this formation from which the body had been completely liberated has come back. It has come back, but... when it came back, when the body saw that, it saw it as one sees a falsehood. And I understood how much the body had changed, because when it saw that, it had the impression... it looked at that with a smile and the impression, ah! that it was an old formation with no truth in it any more. And this was an extraordinary experience: that, the time for that has ended—the time for that has ended. And I know that this Pressure of the Consciousness is a pressure so that things as they were—so miserable, so small, so obscure, so... inescapable as well, apparently—all that is gone behind (<em>Mother makes a gesture over her shoulders</em>); it is a past that has passed. So I really saw—I saw, I understood—that the work of this Consciousness (which is without pity, it does not care whether the thing is difficult or not, probably it does not even care much for apparent ravages) is so that the normal condition should no longer be a thing so heavy, so obscure, and so ugly—so low—and that it should be the dawn... something breaking out on the horizon: a new consciousness—something more true, more luminous.</p>

That explains, moreover, why all those who had not foreseen the possibility that things could be otherwise, used to say, "Better to depart and then..." All that has become so clear.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1175">Even otherwise, it is inexpressible, because it is multiple, complex, and if you do not lay it out in an explanation... it cannot even be said. And as you lay it out in an explanation, at that very moment it is no more true.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1204">It may have become impersonal. I have the feeling that even the consciousness of the body has a minimum of the personal in it. At times I no longer have the feeling of the limits of my body.... I do not know how to say it.... Yes, it is that, it is almost as though it had become fluid. And there <em>should no longer be</em> any personal action. But precisely, inside (I do not know how to explain), it is not even something like a person who has become so big as to take others within herself, it is not that: it is a force, a consciousness which is <em>spread</em> over everything. I do not feel any limit, I feel it is a thing spread out, even physically.... It is because of this that if someone comes with a very active critical sense, wanting to observe and judge, it is as though he enters within, you understand, and that upsets one inside.</p>

And that makes life a little difficult—particularly, yes, particularly when I am seeing people. I see a huge number of people (forty, fifty people every day) and each one brings something which necessitates that this Consciousness that works out all this has to adapt itself to the things coming from outside.... And I see, many people fall ill (or think they are ill or seem to get ill or are really so), but it becomes concrete in the body through their way of being, which is the old way; for this new physical consciousness, it can be avoided, but, oh! it means such a difficulty. One must maintain, through a sort of conscious concentration, a condition, a way of being which is not natural according to the old nature, but which is evidently the new way of being. But in that way, illness can be avoided. But it is almost a Herculean task.</p>

It is the same thing with regard to hearing. So, when they are not there any more, one becomes directly conscious of the thing, and that gives the true knowledge. The Supramental will surely act in that way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1213">Physical sight and hearing have been thrown into the background to make room for identification by consciousness, for the sake of the growth of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1214">The means for relating, knowing, is consciousness identifying itself with the thing or the person. Instead of having the normal sense of separation, there is the sense of constant union. There are experiences altogether interesting. There are people who call me and think of me. That comes into the field of my consciousness. And after a time I am told, “Such a person has come” or “Something has happened to such a person”, and I say, “I know.” At the time the thing had happened, I was not told anything, but I was conscious as though the thing had happened in a part of my own being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1215">One of my legs had been dead for a long time (it is just beginning to revive), paralysed. One leg. So naturally, all became difficult.... But what was remarkable, I can tell you immediately, is that the consciousness established there (<em>gesture above the head</em>) became more and more strong, more and more clear; and it was <em>constant</em>. I worked, I continued to work, not only for India but for the world and in constant relation ("consulted", you understand), actively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1216">About transformation, well, I do not know.... What I have explained about "replacement of consciousness" is being done methodically, methodically, continually, continually, but then with... apparent damages or in any case, for a time, a great diminution of capacities. But it is a curious phenomenon with the sight and hearing: from time to time it is clear, as clear as it can be, and from time to time it is completely veiled. And that has very very clearly another origin—another origin of influence. It will take months, I believe, before I am able to see clearly. In any case, the general consciousness (<em>same gesture above the head</em>), what may be called the universal consciousness (in any case the terrestrial consciousness), has not moved for a minute—not for a minute. It remained there all the while.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1220">Yes, altogether—altogether. It is very strange.... Actually, all this time has been utilised for developing the consciousness of the physical being. And this physical being (<em>Mother touches her body</em>) seems really to have been prepared for another consciousness, because there are things... its reactions are altogether different, its attitude is different. I have passed through a period of total indifference when the world represented nothing, meant nothing. And then, gradually, from there emerged a new perception, as it were. It is only on the way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1221">But it was not an innocent paralysis! For at least three weeks — at least — for three weeks, a constant pain, night and day, twenty-four hours out of twenty-four, without fluctuation, none: it was as though I was being torn asunder.... So there was no question of seeing anybody. Now it is finished. The pain is quite bearable and the body has resumed a little of its normal life.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1227">But I, on my side, kept contact with everyone even physically — I do not know if they remained conscious or not, but I kept contact with everybody. It depends on the receptivity of people. I did not feel at all that there was any rupture of relations or anything of the kind — not at all, not at all. Even at the time when, externally, I was suffering in that way and people thought I was wholly concerned with my suffering, it did not occupy me. I do not know how to explain... I was seeing quite well that this poor body was not very bright, but that did not occupy me. All the while there was the feeling of this... this Truth which has to be understood and manifested.</p>

And then, the reason why only this part has remained became quite clear to me. It is on the way to being converted in a very rapid and interesting manner. This physical mind is being developed under the supramental Influence.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1416">Ah! I do not know, because for me everything has simply been taken away from me — the mind has left completely. If you like, in appearance I became stupid, I knew nothing. And it is the physical mind that developed little by little, through successive revelations. For me, I do not know, the work has been done for me — I did nothing. It has been done in a quite radical way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1417">It could be done because I was <em>very</em> conscious of my psychic (the psychic being which has been formed through all the lives), I was very conscious and it has remained; it has remained and it, precisely, has allowed me to have dealings with men without this making any difference, due to this psychic presence. That is why there has been so little apparent change. So I can say only what I know, and I say this: the psychic must remain there dominating the whole being—the whole bodily being—and guiding the life; then the mental has time to transform itself. My own mind proper has simply been sent away.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1423">Well, the body has given itself entirely, it had even said to the Divine: "I pray to you to make me will for my dissolution if I am to die", so that <em>even there</em> I do not resist if it is necessary for the body to die—even to will for my dissolution. That is its attitude, it was like that (<em>gesture with open hands</em>). And instead of that there came a sort of... (I could translate it by words, but they were not words): "If you accept suffering and ailments, transformation is better than dissolution." And so when there is ailment, it accepts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1424">It is not that, what I say is... it is not really that, but it is something difficult to explain. It is really a new attitude and a new sensation. I am not able to say it.</p>

This body-mind is a very tangible truth; owing to its obscurity and mechanical clinging to past movements and facile oblivion and rejection of the new, we find in it one of the chief obstacles to permeation by the supermind Force and the transformation of the functioning of the body. On the other hand, once effectively converted, it will be one of the most precious instruments for the stabilisation of the supramental Light and Force in material Nature."<br/>

This is the experience: the thing in itself is of a certain kind, and it is our reaction with respect to the thing which differs. The experience is more and more conclusive. There are three categories: our attitude towards things, the things in themselves (these two always bring difficulties), and there is a third category in which everything, everything exists in relation to the Divine, in the Consciousness of the Divine—everything goes on wonderfully!

The goal of this creation is this Consciousness of the Infinite, the Eternal who is Omnipotent — Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent (called God by our religions: for us, in relation to life, it is the Divine) — Infinite and Eternal, Omnipotent... beyond time; each individual particle possessing this Consciousness, each individual particle containing this same Consciousness.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1459">I have observed that people were insincere simply because one part of the being says one thing and another part says another thing. It is that which constitutes insincerity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1460">But that is true so long as one is not unified, my child. As for me it has <em>always</em> been the same thing (<em>Mother makes a gesture of a straight line</em>) for years and years. It comes from there, it is the psychic consciousness, and it is CONSTANT.</p>

This indeed is a sure sign, always like that, always the same. And it is always the same thing: "What Thou willest, what Thou willest."

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1462">This is a recent discovery of mine.

Here it seems to me that the food should not be positively liquid, but not solid either. And then there is the question of the mouth — I do not know. The teeth? Evidently there is no more need of chewing and so the teeth have no more... But there must be something in their place....

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1614">Well, it is very simple. The whole creation must want nothing but the Divine, nothing but to manifest the Divine.

<p class="P" search_id="Notes on the Way - 1615">I have come to this conclusion.
