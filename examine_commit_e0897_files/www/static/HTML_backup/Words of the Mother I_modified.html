<h1><em>Publisher's Note</em></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 10">This volume consists primarily of brief written statements by the Mother about Sri Aurobindo, herself, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Auroville, India, and nations other than India. Written over a period of nearly sixty years (1914 – 1973), the statements have been compiled from her public messages, private notes, and correspondence with disciples. The majority (about sixty per cent) were written in English; the rest were written in French and appear here in translation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 11">The volume also contains a number of conversations, most of them in the part on Auroville. All but one were spoken in French and appear here in translation. There are also several reports of comments by the Mother. These reports were noted down by disciples and later approved by her for publication. All of them were spoken in English. They are identified by the symbol § placed at the end.
</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 12">The volume is arranged by theme in six parts, each part having a number of sections. Within the sections, dated pieces are placed in chronological order, undated ones where they best fit in thematically.
</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 13">Readers should note that most of these statements were given to particular individuals under particular circumstances. The advice in them, therefore, may not apply to everyone.

Grant that we may be worthy of this marvellous Presence and that henceforth everything in us be concentrated on the one will to be more and more perfectly consecrated to the fulfilment of Thy sublime Work.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 269">For the knowledge of the mission, it is difficult to say when it came to me. It is as though I were born with it, and following the growth of the mind and brain, the precision and completeness of this consciousness grew also.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 270">Between 11 and 13 a series of psychic and spiritual experiences revealed to me not only the existence of God but man’s possibility of uniting with Him, of realising Him integrally in consciousness and action, of manifesting Him upon earth in a life divine. This, along with a practical discipline for its fulfilment, was given to me during my body’s sleep by several teachers, some of whom I met afterwards on the physical plane.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 271">Later on, as the interior and exterior development proceeded, the spiritual and psychic relation with one of these beings became more and more clear and frequent; and although I knew little of the Indian philosophies and religions at that time I was led to call him Krishna, and henceforth I was aware that it was with him (whom I knew I should meet on earth one day) that the divine work was to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 272">In the year 1910 my husband came alone to Pondicherry where, under very interesting and peculiar circumstances, he made the acquaintance of Sri Aurobindo. Since then we both strongly wished to return to India — the country which I had always cherished as my true mother-country. And in 1914 this joy was granted to us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 273">As soon as I saw Sri Aurobindo I recognised in him the well-known being whom I used to call Krishna.... And this is enough to explain why I am fully convinced that my place and my work are near him, in India.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 563">I am with you because I am you or you are me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 564">I am with you, that signifies a world of things, because I am with you on all levels, on all planes, from the supreme consciousness down to my most physical consciousness. Here, in Pondicherry, you cannot breathe without breathing my consciousness. It saturates the atmosphere almost materially, in the subtle physical, and extends to the Lake, ten kilometres from here. Farther, my consciousness can be felt in the material vital, then on the mental plane and the other higher planes, everywhere. When I came here for the first time, I felt the atmosphere of Sri Aurobindo, felt it materially at a distance of ten miles, ten nautical miles, not kilometres. It was very sudden, very concrete, an atmosphere pure, luminous, light, light that lifts you up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 565">It is now long since Sri Aurobindo has put up everywhere in the Ashram this reminder that you all know: “Always behave as if the Mother was looking at you, because she is, indeed, always present.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 566">This is not a mere phrase, not simply words, it is a fact. I am with you in a very concrete manner and they who have a subtle vision can see me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 567">In a general way my Force is there constantly at work, constantly shifting the psychological elements of your being to put them in new relations and defining to yourself the different facets of your nature so that you may see what should be changed, developed, rejected.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 568">But that apart, there is a special personal tie between you and me, between all who have turned to the teaching of Sri Aurobindo and myself, — and, it is well understood, distance does not count here, you may be in France, you may be at the other end of the world or in Pondicherry, this tie is always true and living. And each time there comes a call, each time there is a need for me to know so that I may send out a force, an inspiration, a protection or any other thing, a sort of message comes to me all of a sudden and I do the needful. These communications reach me evidently at any moment, and you must have seen me more than once stop suddenly in the middle of a sentence or work; it is because something comes to me, a communication and I concentrate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 569">With those whom I have accepted as disciples, to whom I have said Yes, there is more than a tie, there is an emanation of me. This emanation warns me whenever it is necessary and tells me what is happening. Indeed I receive intimations constantly, but not all are recorded in my active memory, I would be flooded; the physical consciousness acts like a filter. Things are recorded on a subtle plane, they are there in a latent state, something like a piece of music that is recorded without being played, and when I need to know with my physical consciousness, I make contact with this subtle physical plane and the disc begins to turn. Then I see how things are, their development in time, the actual result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 570">And if for some reason you write to me asking for my help and I answer “I am with you”, it means that the communication with you becomes active, you come into my active consciousness for a time, for the time necessary.</p>

<span id="page_74"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 74</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 573">Now remember one thing. Sri Aurobindo and myself are one and the same consciousness, one and the same person. Only, when this force or this presence, which is the same, passes through your individual consciousness, it puts on a form, an appearance which differs according to your temperament, your aspiration, your need, the particular turn of your being. Your individual consciousness is like a filter, a pointer, if I may say so; it makes a choice and fixes one possibility out of the infinity of divine possibilities. In reality, the Divine gives to each individual exactly what he expects of Him. If you believe that the Divine is far away and cruel, He will be far away and cruel, because it will be necessary for your ultimate good that you feel the wrath of God; He will be Kali for the worshippers of Kali and Beatitude for the Bhakta. And He will be the All-knowledge of the seeker of Knowledge, the transcendent Impersonal of the illusionist; He will be atheist with the atheist and the love of the lover. He will be brotherly and close, a friend always faithful, always ready to succour, for those who feel Him as the inner guide of each movement, at every moment. And if you believe that He can wipe away everything, He will wipe away all your faults, all your errors, tirelessly, and at every moment you can feel His infinite Grace. The Divine is indeed what you expect of Him in your deepest aspiration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 574">And when you enter into this consciousness where you see all things in a single look, the infinite multitude of relations between the Divine and men, you see how wonderful all that is, in all details. You can look at the history of mankind and see how much the Divine has evolved according to what men have understood, desired, hoped, dreamed and how He was materialist with the materialist and how He grows every day and becomes nearer, more luminous according as human consciousness widens itself. Each one is free to choose. The perfection of this endless variety of relations of man with God throughout the history of the world is an ineffable marvel. And all that</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 575">The Divine is with you according to your aspiration. Naturally that does not mean that He bends to the caprices of your outer nature, — I speak here of the truth of your being. And yet, sometimes he does fashion himself according to your outer aspirations, and if, like the devotees, you live alternately in separation and union, ecstasy and despair, the Divine also will separate from you and unite with you, according as you believe. The attitude is thus very important, even the outer attitude. People do not know how important is faith, how faith is miracle, creator of miracles. If you expect at every moment to be lifted up and pulled towards the Divine, He will come to lift you and He will be there, quite close, closer, ever closer.</p>

The world is not ready for the supramental force and if it is used without preparing the base, things will shatter completely. I have to prepare the base and then bring down the force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 721">Your human vision sees things in a straight line. For you it is either this way or that way. For me it is not like this. I see the whole thing as a mass of consciousness moving towards its end or goal. For every small movement I have to see what its reactions will be on the whole mass, what repercussions may follow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 722">When I say something should be done in this way or that way, your human mind takes it as a principle and tries to apply it rigidly in all cases. For me it is not like that. For me there are no rules, no regulations and no principles. For me each one is an exceptional case, to be dealt with in a special way. No two cases are similar.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 723">In the movement of this mass of consciousness I know that a certain point should move in a certain direction for reaching the goal more easily. With this point in view I declare that this should be done or not done, but I find that sometimes there is a big obstruction in the way. Now, it can be dealt with in two ways: either I should allow the point to change its direction and leave the barrier alone for the time being till more and more light falls upon it and it gets changed, or I should break the barrier. As I have said, every small movement has its reactions and repercussions on the mass, so this breaking also will cause</p>
<span id="page_93"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 93</p>
<p class="PE">a chain of reactions which may affect a much larger field. I am no respecter of persons, but I have to see at every moment the changing circumstances due to the change of the person or persons concerned and the change of time and the channel through which the thing passes. I have to see with all these changes how best the thing can be done so that it may help the progress of the mass. I have to see whether it is worthwhile to break the barrier and have all the resulting consequences or whether it would not be better to leave it for the moment and tolerate the human stupidity. What appears to you to be contradiction is not contradiction when the whole thing is seen as one. There are various ways to reach the same end. So if I find that breaking will cost much more than what it is worth, then I allow you to go the way you like. But that does not prevent me from condemning the obstruction and saying that it ought to go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 724">After all, sooner or later each and everything in this mass of consciousness has to move towards the same goal. But to lead the consciousness towards that goal I have to allow human beings to move with me and I have to appear in their own form and speak in their own language. I have to adopt a crude expression. I can see the stupidity of the way in which I have to speak and lay down rules and regulations, but this is a concession that I must make to humanity; otherwise it would not be able to understand anything. Even when I speak in their own language, people misunderstand me and make a mess. If I were to speak in the language of the light, then the whole thing would pass over their heads and they would be left gaping without understanding anything.</p>

I say that a certain thing is stupid, but I see that you cannot remain without doing it, so I have to tolerate it. I see the relative value of things and adopt the way that may be helpful in making the progress. In your interest and in the interest of the progress of the whole mass of consciousness, I may have to allow a good many things, but it does not mean that I am blind to them and cannot see their stupidity. Sometimes it is necessary that you should have an experience and so the thing is allowed. But when I say No definitely, it is dangerous to oppose it. There can be many reasons for the same action; but it is not possible to explain them to your mind.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 951">If India is in danger, Pondicherry cannot be expected to remain outside the danger zone. It will share the fate of the rest of the country. The protection I can give is not unconditional. It is idle to hope that in spite of anything and everything, the protection will be there over all. My protection is there if conditions are fulfilled. It goes without saying that any sympathy or support for the Nazis (or for any ally of theirs) automatically cuts across the circle of protection. Apart from this obvious and external factor, there are more fundamental psychological conditions which demand fulfilment. The Divine can give protection only to those who are whole-heartedly faithful to the Divine, who live truly in the spirit of sadhana and keep their consciousness and preoccupation fixed upon the Divine and the service of the Divine. Desire, for example, insistence on one’s likes and conveniences, all movements of hypocrisy and insincerity and falsehood, are great obstacles standing in the way of the Divine’s protection. If you seek to impose your will upon the Divine, it is as if you were calling for a bomb to fall upon you. I do not say that things are bound to happen in this way; but they are very likely to happen, if people do not become conscious and strictly vigilant and act in the true spirit of a spiritual seeker. If the psychological atmosphere remains the same as that of the outside world, there can be no sure wall of security against the dark Forces that are working out in it the ordeal of danger, suffering and destruction entering here.</p>

We carry it very high so that all who have a soul may see it and gather round it.</p>

It <em>continues</em> to be like this. The consciousness is at work constantly, and not as a continuation of what was before, but as a result of what it sees at each instant. In mental movement, there is the consequence of what has been done before―it is not that, it is the consciousness seeing <em>constantly</em> what is to be done. It is extremely important to understand, because it is like this that it continues to work, for everything. It is not at all a "formation" whose growth must be looked after: the consciousness at each second follows—it follows its own movement.... That permits everything; it is just that which permits miracles, reversals, etc.; it permits everything. It is just the opposite of human creations.

<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">DECLARATION TO THE WORKERS OF SRI AUROBINDO ASHRAM</h4>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1405">It is my desire to explain to the workers the special relationship that exists between them and me as compared with the ordinary relationship between employer and employees. It is also</p>
<span id="page_170"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 170</p>
<p class="PE">my desire that having understood this special relationship the workers should always keep this understanding before them in all their deliberations and in all the joint demands which they make to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1406">This special relationship is as follows:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1407">(a) The work in the Ashram is not done for profit, as is well known. Therefore during the war when things became expensive and difficult for everyone, it became so for me too, without my income increasing in any way by the fact of the same circumstances. Industrial and commercial concerns made more profits and so could easily increase the wages, but here in the Ashram only the expenses went on increasing. In spite of this, in view of the difficulties of the workers I gave them regular increments and dearness allowances.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1408">(b) There have been times when there was no work for some workers, but unlike business firms I have never dismissed workers but have always endeavoured to find some other work for them to do. It has always been my policy not to send away, for want of work, workers who have served faithfully. I could have easily done so and could have even closed down all the works without any serious hardship to the Ashram. But by doing so I would have only increased the general misery which is already so great, and that I did not want to do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1409">(c) There are a good number of workers who have worked for me for many long years and have served me with devotion and faithfulness and who besides considering me as their employer have also looked to me as their protector, of them and their families.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1410">(d) On the whole the workers of the Ashram have so far worked more or less as members of a family with me as their head, and this special relationship has no doubt brought benefit to many of them. I would like to preserve this relationship and make it the foundation for all my dealings with the workers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1411">With these points in view, it is suggested that the workers of the Ashram should form a separate syndicate of their own,</p>
<span id="page_171"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 171</p>
<p class="PE">since they stand with regard to their employer in a different position from other workers, as has already been explained. This syndicate might be affiliated to the general body of workers, but would maintain its own line of action and conduct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1412">It is further suggested that this syndicate of Ashram workers should elect a committee which represents the various shades of opinion among the workers. This committee would receive and consider the demands put forward by the workers and, having deliberated and arrived at a decision that it considers just and reasonable, would present it to me for action through their president. I will receive with goodwill and sympathy all requests of this kind and will act for the best according to the reasonableness of the demand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1413">In these times of struggle and conflict and misery and suffering I offer to all who wish to work under me, with me, the possibility of a reciprocal understanding and a fruitful and beneficial collaboration.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1418">As for an increase in your wages, I have already answered you, and I repeat, I have overstepped the limits of my present resources and I cannot add to my expenditure in any way. So if I increase the wages of some of you, I shall be obliged to dismiss some others in order to compensate. It remains to be seen which is stronger: your individual egoism or your collective egoism.</p>

All these — alcohol, tobacco and sexual excess — ruin your health.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1421">Money does not bring happiness. The Sannyasi who possesses nothing and usually eats only one meal a day is perfectly happy if he is sincere. Whereas a rich man may be thoroughly unhappy if he has ruined his health by all sorts of excess and over-indulgence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1422">I repeat, it is not money that makes a man happy, but rather an inner balance of energy, good health and good feelings. Stop drinking, smoking and over-indulging, stop hating and envying, and then you will no longer lament your lot, you will no longer feel that the world is full of misery.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1424">What I wish to do for you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1425">I shall tell you how I view the solution of your problems, both individual and collective, and what is the truth of the relation between us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1426">But for the working out of the programme I am going to place before you, two essential conditions are necessary. First, I must have the financial means to execute my plan; secondly, you must show a minimum of sincerity, honesty and goodwill in your attitude towards me and towards your work. You have most unfortunately the habit of trying to deceive me. Bad advisers have taught you that that is the best thing to do in your relation with your employer. It may be that when the employer himself seeks to deceive you and exploit you, this attitude on your part is legitimate. But in regard to me it is a foolishness</p>
<span id="page_173"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 173</p>
<p class="PE">and a blunder; first of all, because you cannot deceive me and your deceit becomes immediately obvious and takes away from me all desire to come to your aid, and secondly because I am not a “boss” and I do not seek to exploit you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1427">All my effort is towards realising in the world as much truth as actual circumstances will allow; and with the increase of truth, the welfare and happiness of all will necessarily increase.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1428">Differences of caste and class have no truth for me; all that counts is individual value. My aim is to create a big family in which it will be possible for each one to fully develop his capacities and express them. Each one will have his place and occupation in accordance with his capacities and in a relation of goodwill and brotherhood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1429">As a consequence of such a family organisation there will be no need of remuneration or wages. Work should not be a means of earning one’s livelihood; its purpose should be twofold: first to develop one’s nature and capacity for action, and, secondly, in proportion to one’s physical means and moral and intellectual aptitude, to give service to the family to which one belongs and to whose welfare it is but proper to contribute, as it is proper for the family to provide for the real needs of each of its members.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1430">To give a concrete form to this ideal under the present conditions of life, my idea is to build a kind of city accommodating at the outset about two thousand persons. It will be built according to the most modern plans, meeting all the most up-to-date requirements of hygiene and public health. It will have not only residential houses, but also gardens and sportsgrounds for physical culture. Each family will be lodged in a separate house; bachelors will be grouped according to their occupations and affinities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1431">Nothing necessary for life will be forgotten. Kitchens equipped in the most modern hygienic way will supply equally to all simple and healthy food, assuring the energy necessary for the proper maintenance of the body.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1433">Each one can choose the kind of activity that is most suitable to his nature and will receive the required training. Even small gardens will be provided where those who like cultivation can grow flowers, fruits and vegetables.</p>

A department of hygiene will have the exclusive function of inspecting all public and private buildings to see that the most rigorous rules of cleanliness are observed everywhere and by all. As natural adjuncts to this department public baths and common laundries will be put at the disposal of everyone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1435">Finally, big stores will be set up where one can find all the small “extras” which give life variety and pleasantness and which one will get against “coupons” that will be given in recompense for especially notable achievement in work or conduct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 1436">I shall not give a long description of the organisation and the working of the institution, although everything in it to the smallest details has already been foreseen.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2129">Have you heard of Auroville?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2130">For a long time, I had a plan of the “ideal town”, but that was during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime, with Sri Aurobindo living at the centre. Afterwards, I was no longer interested. Then the idea of Auroville — I gave the name Auroville — was taken up again, but from the other end: instead of the formation having to find the place, it was the place — near the lake — which gave birth to the formation, and until now I took only a very minor interest in it, for I had received nothing directly. Then our little A took it into her head to have a house there, by the lake, and to have a house for me next to hers, and to offer it to me. And she wrote me all her dreams: one or two sentences suddenly stirred an old, old memory of something which had tried to manifest — a creation — when I was very young and which had again started trying to manifest at the very beginning of the century, when I was with Theon.´ Then all that was forgotten. It came back with this letter; all at once, I had my plan for Auroville. Now I have my overall plan, I am waiting for B to draw the detailed plans, for I had said from the beginning: “B will be the architect”, and I wrote to B. When he came here last year, he went to see Chandigarh, the town built by Le Corbusier, up there in the Punjab, and he was not very happy. It seems quite ordinary to me — I know nothing about it, I haven’t seen it, I only saw some photographs which were horrible. And while he was speaking to me, I could see that he felt, “Oh, if only I had a town to build!...” So I wrote to him: “If you want, I have a town to build.” He is happy. He is coming. When he comes, I shall show him my plan and he will build the town. My plan is very simple.</p>
<span id="page_250"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 250</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2131">The place is up there, on the Madras road, on top of the hill. (<em>Mother takes a paper and begins to draw.</em>) We have here―naturally, it is not like that in Nature, we shall have to adapt ourselves; it is like that up there on the ideal plane―here, a central point. This central point is a park which I saw when I was very young―perhaps the most beautiful thing in the world from the point of view of physical, material Nature―a park with water and trees, like all parks, and flowers, but not many; flowers in the form of creepers, palms and ferns, all varieties of palms; water, if possible running water, and possibly a small cascade. From the practical point of view, it would be very good: at the far end, outside the park, we could build reservoirs which would be used to supply water to the residents.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2132">So in this park, I saw the "Pavilion of Love". But I dislike this word, for man has turned it into something grotesque; I am speaking of the principle of Divine Love. But that has changed: it will be "The Pavilion of the Mother"―but not this (<em>Mother points to herself</em>)―the Mother, the true Mother, the principle of the Mother. I say "Mother" because Sri Aurobindo used that word, otherwise I would have put something else, I would have put "creative principle" or "principle of realisation" or―I do not know.... It will be a small building, not a big one, with only a meditation room downstairs, but with columns and probably a circular shape. I say probably, because I am leaving that for B to decide. Upstairs, the first floor will be a room and the roof will be a covered terrace. You know the ancient Indo-Moghul miniatures, with palaces where there are terraces with small roofs supported by columns? You know those old miniatures? Hundreds of them have come into my hands.... But this pavilion is very, very beautiful, a small pavilion like this, with a roof on a terrace, and low walls with couches against them to sit on, to meditate in the open air in the evening, at night. And below, downstairs, at ground-level, a meditation room, simply―something quite bare. There would probably be at the far end something which would be a living light, perhaps the symbol in</p>
<span id="page_251"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 251</p>
<p class="PE">living light, a constant light. Otherwise, a very peaceful, very silent place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2133">Nearby, there would be a small dwelling, a small dwelling which would nevertheless have three floors, but not large-sized, and that would be the house of A, who would serve as a guardian. She would be the guardian of the pavilion. She wrote me a very nice letter but she did not understand all that, of course.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2134">That is the centre.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2135">All around, there is a circular road which separates the park from the rest of the town. There would probably be a gateway―in fact there must be one―in the park. A gateway with the guardian of the gate. The guardian of the gate is a new girl who has come from Africa, who wrote me a letter telling me that she wanted to be the guardian of Auroville in order to let only the "servants of Truth" enter (<em>Mother laughs</em>). It is a very nice plan. So I shall probably put her there as guardian of the park, with a small house on the road at the entrance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2136">But the interesting thing is that around this central point, there are four big sections, like four big petals (<em>Mother draws</em>), but the corners of the petals are rounded and there are small intermediate zones―four big sections and four zones.... Naturally that is only in the air; on the ground, it will be an approximation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2137">We have four big sections: the cultural section, to the North, that is to say, towards Madras; to the East, the industrial section; to the South, the international section; and to the West, that is to say, towards the lake, the residential section.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2138">To make myself clear: the residential section, where there will be the houses of the people who have already subscribed and of all the others who are coming in large numbers to have a plot in Auroville. That will be next to the lake.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2139">The international section: we have already approached a certain number of ambassadors and countries for each one to have its pavilion — a pavilion from every country. It was an old idea. Some have already accepted, so it is on the way.</p>
<span id="page_252"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 252</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2140">Each pavilion has its own garden with, as far as possible, a representation of the plants and products of the country which it represents. If they have enough money and enough space, they can also have a sort of small museum or permanent exhibition of the country’s achievements. The buildings should be constructed according to the architecture of each country — it should be like a document of information. Then, depending on the money they wish to spend, they could also have accommodation for students, conference-rooms, etc., a cuisine of the country, a restaurant of the country — they could have all kinds of developments.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2141">Then the industrial section. Already many people, including the Government of Madras — the Madras Government is loaning money — want to start industries, which will be on a special basis. This industrial section is to the East and it is very big, there is plenty of space; it will go down towards the sea. In fact, to the North of Pondicherry there is quite a large area which is totally uninhabited and uncultivated; it is by the sea, going up the coast towards the North. So this industrial section would go down towards the sea, and if possible there would be a kind of wharf — not exactly a port but a place where boats could come alongside; and all these industries, with the inland transportation they need, would have a possibility to export directly. And there, there would be a big hotel — B has already made a plan for it; we wanted to build the hotel here, on the site of the “Messageries Maritimes”, but after having said yes, the owner said no; it is very good, it will be better over there — a big hotel to receive visitors from outside. Already quite a number of industries have registered for this section; I do not know if there will be enough room, but we shall manage.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2142">Then, to the North — that is where there is the most space, of course — towards Madras, the cultural section. There, an auditorium — the auditorium which I have dreamt of building for a long time; plans had already been made — an auditorium</p>
<span id="page_253"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 253</p>
<p class="PE">with a concert-hall and a grand organ, the best of its kind today. It seems they are making wonderful things. I want a grand organ. There will also be a stage with wings — a rotating stage, etc., the best of its kind. So, a magnificent auditorium, there. There will be a library, there will be a museum with all sorts of exhibitions — not inside the auditorium: in addition to it there will be a film-studio, a film-school; there will be a gliding club. Already we almost have authorisation from the Government, and the promise, so it is already well on the way. Then towards Madras, where there is plenty of space, a stadium. We want this stadium to be the most modern and the most perfect possible, with the idea — it is an idea I have had for a long time — that twelve years — the Olympic Games take place every four years — twelve years from 1968 — in ’68 the Olympiads are taking place in Mexico — twelve years later we would hold the Olympic Games in India, there. So we need space.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2143">Between these sections, there are intermediate zones, four intermediate zones: one for public services, post office, etc.; one zone for transport, railway station and possibly an aerodrome; one zone for food — that one would be near the lake and would include dairies, poultry farms, orchards, cultivated lands, etc.; it would spread and include the Lake Estate: what they wanted to do separately would be within the framework of Auroville. Then a fourth zone. I have said: public services, transport, food, and the fourth zone: shops. We do not need many shops, but a few are necessary in order to obtain what we do not produce. They are like districts, you see.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>And you will be there at the centre?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2144">A hopes so (<em>Mother laughs</em>). I did not say no, I did not say yes; I told her, "The Lord will decide." It depends on my state of health. A removal, no―I am here because of the Samadhi, I shall stay here, that is quite sure. But I can go there on a visit; it is not so far, it takes five minutes by car. But A wants to be quiet,</p>
<span id="page_254"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 254</p>
<p class="PE">silent, aloof, and that is quite possible in her park, surrounded by a road, with someone to stop people from coming in; one can stay very quiet — but if I am there, that is the end of it! There would be collective meditations, etc. That is to say that if I get a sign, first the physical sign, then the inner command to go out, I shall drive there and spend an hour, in the afternoon — I can do that now and then. We still have time because, before everything is ready, it will take years.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>That is to say that the disciples will stay here?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2145">Ah! The Ashram stays here — the Ashram stays here, I stay here, that is understood. Auroville is...</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>A satellite.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2146">Yes, it is the contact with the outside world. The centre on my drawing is a symbolic centre.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2147">But that is what A expects: she wants a house where she would be all alone next to a house where I would be all alone. The second part is a dream, because myself all alone.... You only have to see what is happening! It is true, isn’t it? So it does not go with the “all alone”. Solitude must be found within, it is the only way. But as far as living is concerned, I shall certainly not go and live there, because the Samadhi is here; but I could go there to visit. For example, I could go there for an inauguration or for certain ceremonies. We shall see. It will be years from now.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>In short, Auroville is more for outside?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2148">Oh yes! It is a town! Consequently, it is the whole contact with outside. An attempt to realise on earth a more ideal life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2149">In the old formation which I had made, there had to be a hill and a river. There had to be a hill, because Sri Aurobindo’s</p>
<span id="page_255"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 255</p>
<p class="PE">house was on top of the hill. But Sri Aurobindo was there at the centre. It was arranged according to the plan of my symbol, that is to say, a point in the middle, with Sri Aurobindo and all that concerned Sri Aurobindo’s life, and four big petals — which were not the same as on this drawing, it was something else — and twelve all around, the town itself; and around that, there were the residences of the disciples; you know my symbol: instead of lines, there are bands; well, the last circular band formed the area for the disciples’ residences, and each one had his own house and garden — a small house and a garden for each one. There was some means of transport, I wasn’t sure if it was individual transport or collective transport — like those small open tramcars in the mountains, you know — going in all directions to take the disciples back towards the centre of the town. And around all that, there was a wall, with a gateway and guardians at the gate, and one could not enter without authorisation. There was no money — within the walls, no money; at the various entrances, there were banks or counters of some sort, where people could deposit their money and receive tickets in exchange, with which they could obtain lodging, food, this, that. But no money — the tickets were only for visitors, who could not enter without a permit. It was a tremendous organisation.... No money, I did not want any money.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2150">Look! In my plan I forgot one thing. I wanted to build a housing estate for workers, but the housing estate was to be part of the industrial section, perhaps an extension along the edge of the industrial section.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2151">Outside the walls, in my first formation, on one side there was an industrial town, and on the other, fields, farms, etc., to supply the town. But that represented a real country — not a big country, but a country. Now it is much reduced. It is no longer my symbol; there are only four zones and there are no walls. And there will be money. You see, the other formation was truly an ideal endeavour.... But I counted on many years before trying to start. At that time I thought twenty-four years. But now it is</p>
<span id="page_256"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 256</p>
<p class="PE">much more modest, it is a transitional attempt, and it is much more realisable. The other plan was... I almost had the land; it was in the time of Sir Akbar, you remember, from Hyderabad. They sent me some photographs of the State of Hyderabad and there, in those photographs, I found my ideal spot: an isolated hill, quite a big hill, and below it, a large, flowing river. I told him, “I want this place”, and he arranged the matter. Everything was arranged. They sent me the plans, the papers and everything, saying that they were giving it to the Ashram. But they laid down one condition — it was virgin forest, uncultivated land — the place was given on condition, naturally, that we would cultivate it — but the products must be utilised on the spot; for example, the crops, the wood, must be utilised on the spot, not transported; nothing could leave the State of Hyderabad. There was even C, who was a navigator, who said that he would obtain a sailing boat from England to go up the river to fetch the products and bring them to us here. Everything was very well planned! Then they set this condition. I asked if it was not possible to have it removed; then Sir Akbar died and that was the end of it, the matter was dropped. Afterwards, I was glad that it was not done because, now that Sri Aurobindo has departed, I cannot leave Pondicherry. I could only leave Pondicherry with him provided that he accepted to live in his ideal town. At that time, I had spoken of this project to D, the person who built Golconde; and he was enthusiastic, he told me, “As soon as you start to build, call me, I shall come.” I had shown him my plan; it was based on an enlargement of my symbol; he was most enthusiastic, he thought it was magnificent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2152">It was dropped. But the other one, which is just a small intermediate attempt, we can try.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2153">I have no illusions that it will keep its original purity, but we shall try something.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2154">For the time being, E is taking care of that, because he receives the money through the Sri Aurobindo Society and he bought the land. A fair amount of land has already been bought. It is going well. Naturally, the difficulty is to find enough money. But, for example, the pavilions — each country will bear the expenses for its own pavilion; the industries — each industry will provide the money for its own business; the residents — each one will give the money necessary for his land. The Government — Madras has already given us the promise — will give between sixty and eighty per cent: one part grant, that is to say, gift; one part loan, free of interest and repayable over ten years, twenty years, forty years — a long-term repayment. E knows all about it, he has already had quite a few results. But according to whether the money comes in quickly or comes in little by little, it will go more or less quickly. From the construction point of view, it will depend on B’s plasticity; the details are all the same to me — only I would like this pavilion to be very beautiful. I can see it. For I have seen it, I have had the vision of it; so I shall try to make him understand what I have seen. And the park too, I have seen it — these are old visions which I had repeatedly.

But, anyway, even without such grandiose things, something must be done to supply the water. That will be the greatest difficulty; that will take the most time. All the rest, light, power, will be done on the spot in the industrial section — but water cannot be made! The Americans have seriously thought of finding a way to use sea-water, because the earth no longer has enough drinking water for man — the water which they call “fresh”: it is ironical; the amount of water is not enough for the</p>

There has already been much talk about it. There were discussions between Air India and another company; then they could not come to an agreement — all sorts of petty, foolish difficulties.

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Autonomous?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2191">“Autonomous” is understood to mean some kind of independence which breaks off relations with others, and that is not what I mean.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2192">For example, those who produce food, like Aurofood — of course, when we are 50,000 it will be difficult to provide for all the needs, but for the moment we are only a few thousand at most — well, a factory always produces far too much, so it will sell outside and receive money. Aurofood for example wants to have a special relationship with the workers — not at all the old system, something which would be an improvement on the communist system, a more balanced organisation than sovietism, that is, something which does not err too much on one side at the expense of the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2193">There is one thing I wanted to say: the participation in the well-being and life of the town as a whole is not something calculated on an individual basis; that is, this individual should give so much, it is not like that. It is calculated according to</p>
<span id="page_263"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 263</p>
<p class="PE">the means, the activity, the capacity for production; it is not the democratic idea which cuts everything up into equal pieces, which is an absurd machinery. It is calculated according to one’s means: one who has much gives much, one who has little gives little; one who is strong works hard, one who is not strong does something else. You see, it is something truer, deeper. That is why I make no attempt to explain now, because people will start to make all kinds of complaints. All this must come about automatically, so to speak, with the growth of the city, in the true spirit. That is why this note is extremely concise.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2194">For example, this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">“All who live there will participate in its life and development.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2195">All who live there will participate in its life and development according to their capacities and means, not mechanically — so much per unit. That’s it, it must be something living and true, not a mechanical thing; and according to each one’s capacities: that is, one who has material means, such as those provided by a factory, should give in proportion to its production, not so much per individual, per head.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">“The participation may be passive or active.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2196">I do not understand what “passive” means; I said it in French and it has been put into English. What could that mean, “passive”?... It would be something more like planes or different levels of consciousness.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2197">Yes, that’s it. Those who have a higher knowledge do not need to work with their hands, that is what I meant.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2198">So that is clear: there will be no taxes, but each one will have to contribute to the collective welfare by his work, in kind or in money. Those who have nothing but money will give money. But to tell the truth, “work” can be inner work — but one cannot say that, because people are not honest enough. The work can be an occult, completely inner work; but for that, it must be absolutely sincere and true, and with the capacity for it: no pretension. But not necessarily a physical work.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>"Sections like industries which participate actively will contribute part of their income towards the development of the township; or if they produce something (like foodstuffs) that is useful to the citizens, they will contribute in kind to the township, which is responsible for feeding its citizens."</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2199">This is what we were just saying. The industries will participate actively, they will contribute. If these industries produce articles which are not constantly needed and therefore in amounts or quantities that are too great to be used within the city but which will sell outside, they, of course, should participate with money. And I give food as an example; those who produce food will give what they produce to the town — in proportion to what they produce, of course — and the town is responsible for feeding everyone. That means that people will not need to buy food with money; but it must be earned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2200">It is a sort of adaptation of the communist system, but not in a spirit of levelling; according to the capacity, the position — not the psychological or intellectual, but the inner position of each one.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2202">What I mean is that usually―always so far, and now more and more―men lay down mental rules according to their conceptions and ideals, and then they apply them (<em>Mother brings down her fist to show the world in the grip of mind</em>), and that is absolutely false, it is arbitrary, unreal―and the result is that things revolt or wither and disappear... It is the experience of life itself that should slowly elaborate rules which are as flexible and wide as possible, to be always progressive. Nothing should be fixed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2203">That is the great error of governments; they make a framework and say, “There you are, we have set this up and now we must live by it”, and so of course they crush life and prevent it from progressing.

Insincerity is in all men. There are perhaps a hundred men on earth who are totally sincere.

Yoga is the way to become sincere in all parts of the being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2217" style="font-style:italic">Apropos Auroville: on money and government.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2218">The conflict about money is what might be called a "conflict of ownership", but the truth is that money belongs to no one. This idea of <em>possessing</em> money has warped everything. Money should not be a "possession": like power it is a means of action which is given to you, but you must use it according to... what we can call the "will of the Giver", that is, in an impersonal and enlightened way. If you are a good instrument for diffusing and utilising money, then it comes to you, and it comes to you in proportion to your capacity to use it as it is meant to be used. That is the true mechanism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2219">The true attitude is this: money is a force intended for the work on earth, the work required to prepare the earth to receive and manifest the divine forces, and it — that is, the power of</p>
<span id="page_268"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 268</p>
<p class="PE">utilising it — must come into the hands of those who have the clearest, most comprehensive and truest vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2220">To start with, the first thing (but this is elementary) is not to have the sense of possession — what does it mean, “it is mine”?... Now, I don’t quite understand. Why do people want it to belong to them? — so that they can use it as they like and do what they want with it and handle it according to their own conceptions? That’s how it is. On the other hand, yes, there are people who like to store it up somewhere... but that is a disease. To be sure of always having some, they hoard it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2221">But if people understood that one should be like a receiving and transmitting station and that the wider the range (just the opposite of personal), the more impersonal, comprehensive and wide it is, the most force it can hold (“force” that is translated materially: notes and coins). This power to hold is proportional to the capacity to use the money in the best way — “best” in terms of the general progress: the widest vision, the greatest understanding and the most enlightened, exact and true usage, not according to the warped needs of the ego but according to the general need of the earth for its evolution and development. That is to say, the widest vision will have the largest capacity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2222">Behind all wrong movements, there is a true movement; there is a joy in being able to direct, utilise, organise in such a way that there is a minimum of waste and the maximum of result. It is a very interesting vision to have. And this must be the true side in people who want to accumulate money: it is the capacity to use it on a very large scale. Then, there are those who very much like to have it and spend it; that is something else―they are generous natures, neither regulated nor organised. But the joy of being able to satisfy all <em>true</em> needs, all necessities, is good. It is like the joy of changing a sickness into health, a falsehood into truth, a suffering into joy; it is the same thing: to change an artificial and foolish need―which does not correspond to anything natural―into a possibility which becomes something quite natural. So much money is needed to do this or that or</p>

<p class="PE">the other, so much is needed to arrange this, to repair that, to build this, to organise that — that is good.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2223">When the need to accumulate and the need to spend (which are both blind and ignorant) are combined, they can lead to a clear vision and a most efficient utilisation. That is good.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2226">Money does not belong to anybody. Money is a collective possession which should be used only by those who have an integral, comprehensive and universal vision. I would add something to that: not only integral and comprehensive, but essentially <em>true</em> as well; a vision which can tell the difference between a use which is in accord with the universal progress, and a use which could be termed fanciful. But these are details, for even the mistakes, even, from a certain standpoint, the waste, help the general progress: these are lessons learned the hard way.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2232">Yes. The first thing that should be accepted and recognised by everyone is that the invisible and higher power — that is, the power which belongs to a plane of consciousness that is mostly veiled, but which is within each; a consciousness which can be called anything, by any name, it does not matter, but which is integral and pure in the sense that it is not false, it is in the Truth — that this power is capable of ordering material things in a way that is truer, happier and better for everyone than any material power. That is the first point. Once people agree on that...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2233">It is not something one can pretend to have; an individual cannot pretend to have it, either he has it or he hasn't, because (<em>Mother laughs</em>) in any circumstance of life, if it is a pretension, it will show clearly! On top of that, it does not give you any material power. There again, X once said―he was speaking of the true hierarchy, the hierarchy based on each one's power of consciousness―the individual or individuals who are at the very summit necessarily have the least needs; their material needs become less as their capacity of material vision grows. And that is very true. It is automatic and spontaneous, not the result of an effort: the wider the consciousness, the more it embraces things and realities―the less its material needs, automatically, because</p>
<span id="page_271"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 271</p>
<p class="PE">they lose all their importance and value. The need for material necessities is reduced to a minimum, which will itself change with the progressive development of Matter.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2235">And the second thing is the power of conviction; that is, the highest consciousness, when it is brought into contact with Matter, spontaneously has a greater power of conviction than all the intermediary planes. By mere contact, its power of conviction, that is, its power of transformation, is greater than that of all the intermediary planes. That is a fact. These two facts together make it impossible for any pretension to last long. I am looking at it from the standpoint of a collective organisation.</p>

Only what is right at the very summit and is perfectly pure, has this power of spontaneous conviction.

Like that, with a ray of light striking it all the time, which turns, turns, turns... with the sun, you understand. If that is properly done, it will be very good. And then underneath, so that people can sit and meditate, or simply rest, <em>nothing</em>, nothing, except something comfortable underneath so that they can sit without getting tired, probably with some pillars, which would serve as back-rests at the same time. Something like that. And that is what I always see. And the room should be high, so that the sun can enter as a <em>ray</em>, according to the time of day, and strike the centre which will be there. If that is done, it will be very good.</p>

At first they thought of making a place for me to stay, but I will never go there, so it is not worth the trouble, it is completely useless. And to look after this island it was agreed that there would be a little house for B who would like to be there simply as the guardian. And then A had arranged a whole system of bridges to link it with the other bank. And the other bank would consist entirely of gardens all around. These gardens... we thought of twelve gardens — to divide the distance into twelve, of making twelve gardens, each one centred on something, a state of consciousness, and the flowers which represent it. And then, the twelfth garden would be in the water, around — not around, but beside — the “Mandir”, with the tree, the banyan which is there. That is the centre of the city. And there, the twelve gardens around the outside would be repeated with the flowers arranged in the same way.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2275">And then, inside, there will be twelve columns. The walls and then twelve columns. And right at the centre, on the floor, there is my symbol, and above it four of Sri Aurobindo's symbols, joined to form a square, and above that.. a globe. If possible, a globe made of transparent material, and with or without light inside, but the sun should strike the globe; then according to the month, the time, it will be from here, from there, from there (<em>gesture indicating the movement of the sun</em>). You understand? There will always be an opening with a ray. Not a diffused light: a ray which strikes, which should strike. It will require some technical knowledge to be able to carry it out, and that is why I want to make a design with an engineer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2276">And then, there will be no windows or lights inside. It will always be in a kind of clear half-light, day and night―by day with the sun, by night with artificial light. And on the floor, nothing, just a floor like this one (<em>in Mother's room</em>). That is to say, first wood (wood or something else), then a sort of rubber foam, thick, very soft, and then a carpet. A carpet everywhere, everywhere except at the centre. And people will be able to sit everywhere. And the twelve columns are for people who need support for their backs!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2277">And then, people will not come for a regular meditation or anything of that kind (but the inner organisation will be made afterwards): it will be a place for concentration.

We cannot think of having to open and close something when it rains, it is not possible. It must be arranged in such a way that the rain cannot get in. But the sun must enter as rays, not diffused.

The following talks were edited from tape-recordings of these twenty-two meetings.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2436">To be practical, you must first have a very clear vision of your goal, of where you are going. From this point of view, take money for example. An ideal which may be several hundred years ahead of its time, we don’t know: money should be a power which belongs to nobody and which should be controlled by the most universal wisdom present. Put on the earth someone who has a vision vast enough to be able to know the needs of the earth and precise enough to be able to tell where the money should go — you understand, we are very far from that, aren’t</p>

<p class="PE">we? For the moment, the gentleman still says, “This is mine”, and when he is generous, he says, “I give it to you.” That’s not it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2437">But there is a long way to go between what we are and what must be. And for that we must be very flexible, never losing sight of the goal, but knowing that we cannot reach it at one bound and that we must find the way. Well, that is much more difficult, even more difficult than to make the inner discovery. Truly speaking, that should have been made before coming here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2438">For there is a starting-point: when you have found within yourself the light that never wavers, the presence which can guide you with certitude, then you become aware that constantly, in everything that happens, there is something to be learnt, and that in the present state of matter there is always a progress to be made. That is how one should come, eager to find out at every minute the progress to be made. To have a life that wants to grow and perfect itself, that is what the collective ideal of Auroville should be: “A life that wants to grow and perfect itself”, and above all, not in the same way for everyone — each one in his own way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2439">Well, now there are thirty of you, it is difficult, isn’t it? When there are thirty thousand of you, it will be easier, because, naturally, there will be many more possibilities. You are the pioneers, you have the most difficult task, but I feel it is the most interesting one. Because you must establish in a concrete, durable and growing way the attitude that is needed to truly be an Aurovilian. To learn every day the lesson that is needed to truly be an Aurovilian. To learn every day the lesson of the day.... Each sunrise is an opportunity to make a discovery. So, with that state of mind, you find out. Everyone does.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2440">And the body needs activity: if you keep it inactive, it will begin to revolt by becoming sick and so on. It needs an activity, it really needs an activity like planting flowers, building a house,</p>
<span id="page_311"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 311</p>
<p class="PE">something really material. You must feel it. Some people do exercises, some ride bicycles, there are countless activities, but in your little group you must all come to an agreement so that each one can find the activity which suits his temperament, his nature and his need. But not with ideas. Ideas are not much good, ideas give you preconceptions, for example, “That is a good work, that work is not worthy of me,” and all that sort of nonsense. There is no bad work — there are only bad workers. All work is good when you know how to do it in the right way. Everything. And it is a kind of communion. If you are fortunate enough to be conscious of an inner light, you will see that in your manual work, it is as if you called the Divine down into things; then the communion becomes very concrete, there is a whole world to be discovered, it is marvellous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2441">You are young, you have plenty of time before you. And to be young, to be really young, we must always, always keep on growing, developing, progressing. Growth is the sign of youthfulness and there is no limit to the growth of consciousness.

It is their own business. It is their own business. If they want to go through this experience, let them do it. But the Ashram is not the place for it. Thank God, at the Ashram we have learnt that life is something else. True life is not the satisfaction of desires.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2931">Most of the statements in this volume were first published between the 1930s and 1970s in books and journals put out by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram or groups associated with it. The remaining statements first appeared in 1980 in the first edition of this volume. About sixty per cent of the statements were written or spoken in English, the rest in French.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2932">The volume has been divided into six parts, each part having a number of sections. Each section does not necessarily contain all of the statements that could be placed there. Each statement has been put only in one section, though it might have been put in more than one. Statements that appear in other volumes have not, as a rule, been reproduced here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2933">Quotations from the works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother are occasionally cited in the text and footnotes. The sources of these works are the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library (SABCL) and the second edition of the Collected Works of the Mother (CWM).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother I - 2934">The text of this second edition is the same as that of the first edition, apart from the correction of some typographical errors and the revision of a few English translations.</p>
