<h1><em>Publisher's Note</em></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 10">This volume consists primarily of brief written statements by the Mother on various aspects of spiritual life. Written between the late 1920s and the early 1970s, the statements have been compiled from her public messages, private notes, and correspondence with disciples. About two-thirds of them were written in English; the rest were written in French and appear here in English translation. The volume also contains a small number of spoken comments, most of them in English. Some are tape-recorded messages; others are reports by disciples that were later approved by the Mother for publication. These reports are identified by the symbol § placed at the end.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 11">
The volume is arranged by theme in seven parts, each part having a number of sections. Within the sections, dated statements have been placed in chronological order, undated ones where they best fit in thematically.
</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 12">
Many of the one-sentence statements dated 1954 and 1955 are translations or adaptations by the Mother of extracts from her <em>Prières et Méditations</em>. A number of definitions of terms are comments by her on the significances she has given to various flowers.
</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 13">
The reader should note that most of the statements here were given to particular persons under particular circumstances. The advice in them, therefore, may not apply to everyone.</p>

Once the union with the Supreme is realised one must bring down that realisation to the exterior world and change the conditions of life upon the earth until a total transformation is accomplished. In accordance with this aim, the sadhaks of the integral yoga do not retire from the world to lead a life of contemplation and meditation. Each one must devote at least one third of his time to a useful work. All activities are represented in the Ashram and each one chooses the work most congenial to his nature, but must do it in a spirit of service and unselfishness, keeping always in view the aim of integral transformation.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 435">The integral yoga consists of an uninterrupted series of examinations that one has to undergo without any previous warning, thus obliging you to be constantly on the alert and attentive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 436">Three groups of examiners set us these tests. They appear to have nothing to do with one another, and their methods are so different, sometimes even so apparently contradictory, that it seems as if they could not possibly be leading towards the same goal. Nevertheless, they complement one another, work towards the same end, and are all indispensable to the completeness of the result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 437">The three types of examination are: those set by the forces of Nature, those set by spiritual and divine forces, and those set by hostile forces. These last are the most deceptive in their appearance and to avoid being caught unawares and unprepared requires a state of constant watchfulness, sincerity and humility.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 438">The most commonplace circumstances, the events of everyday life, the most apparently insignificant people and things all belong to one or other of these three kinds of examiners. In this vast and complex organisation of tests, those events that are generally considered the most important in life are the easiest examinations to undergo, because they find you ready and on your guard. It is easier to stumble over the little stones in your path, because they attract no attention.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 441">Vigilance, sincerity and humility for the examinations from hostile forces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 442">And do not imagine that there are on the one hand people who undergo the examinations and on the other people who set them. Depending on the circumstances and the moment we are all both examiners and examinees, and it may even happen that one is at the same time both examiner and examinee. And the benefit one derives from this depends, both in quality and in quantity, on the intensity of one’s aspiration and the awakening of one’s consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 443">To conclude, a final piece of advice: never set yourself up as an examiner. For while it is good to remember constantly that one may be undergoing a very important examination, it is extremely dangerous to imagine that one is responsible for setting examinations for others. That is the open door to the most ridiculous and harmful kinds of vanity. It is the Supreme Wisdom which decides these things, and not the ignorant human will.</p>

It is long since this time has passed. The force has come farther down in its action and now it is at work not only in the material but also in the subconscient and even in the inconscient. Unless you follow this descending movement and allow the force to act in your body and these material regions of the consciousness, you find yourself stranded on the side of the road without being able to advance any further. And to allow this working of the force it is a detailed surrender of all movements, habits, tastes, preferences, sense of necessities, etc. that is urgently required.</p>

I had no fear at all, but simply said, "If you have come from the Mother, you can do what you like; if not, I have nothing to do with you, whoever you may be. I firmly withdraw from your influence and you cannot touch one hair of mine." With that, I quietly started taking your name and withdrew into myself, yet observed their actions.

That is why love sprang up, the irresistible power of union.</p>

In its essence, love is one, just as consciousness is one; but in the manifestation, it is coloured and differentiated by each individual nature. If you are impure and egoistic, love in you will become impure and egoistic, narrow, sectarian, limited, ambitious and possessive, violent, jealous, vulgar, brutal and cruel. Is this the kind of love that can be offered to God? If you want your love to be worthy of the one you love, if you want to enjoy love in its eternal perfection, become perfect, break out of the limitations of your ego, partake of eternity. And then you will always be close to the object of your love, for you will grow into his likeness.</p>

These are movements of ignorance, nothing more. You should not attempt to convince; above all, you should not let yourself be touched or shaken.

To be one in aspiration and ascension, to move forward at the same pace on the same spiritual path, that is the secret of a lasting union.</p>

In any case, marriage is not a direct way to prepare oneself for sadhana. It can be an indirect one if the outward nature needs troubles and disappointments to get rid of all worldly attachments, but in that case the experiment usually ends by separation and often a painful one, at least for one of the two associates. That is all I can tell you on the subject.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>This raises some important questions which I state below for Your clarification:</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="Q">1. Do You consider this dissolution of the family system indispensable only for the few exceptional individuals who follow some high mental or spiritual ideal or also for the general humanity?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3331">Yes, only for the few exceptional individuals who follow some high mental or spiritual ideal.</p>
<p class="Q">2. If You advocate a complete dissolution of the family system for the entire humanity, do You consider it advisable for it to happen even before the new process of birth by direct materialisation has been normalised on earth?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3332">More liberty and plasticity in the system are advisable. Fixed rules are harmful to evolution.</p>
<span id="page_289"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 289</p>
<p class="Q">3. Do You also consider the abolition of the marriage system as equally indispensable as the abolition of the family system for the higher development of humanity? So long as the new process of birth has not been normalised, would not the present manner of sexual procreation continue? In that case, would not some form of marriage relationship be necessary?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3333">Marriage will always take place, but legal ceremonies must not be enforced, to avoid <em>illegality</em>.</p>
<p class="Q">4. So long as the new process of birth has not been normalised and the children continue to be born through the present sexual process, is not the family life and atmosphere best suited to their upbringing, especially in their early formative years? The other alternative is to provide for their care and upbringing through some other agency, like the State-nurseries, as was advocated by some Communist thinkers. But this view has not found many supporters, for it has been realised that the tender and affectionate care which the young children need could best be provided only in the intimate atmosphere of the family home by the parents. If this is true, then for the sake of the young children at least, would not the family be necessary, until the new method of birth becomes possible and normal in future?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3334">Here also both things must be equally admitted and practised. There are many cases in which it would be a blessing for the baby to be separated from his parents.</p>

When you surrendered, it is not the whole of your being that did so. Little by little some other part that had not surrendered came to the surface and the joy of the surrender vanished and was replaced by dullness and indifference. But after some time this part also gets converted and thus the happy condition comes back.</p>

For it is the lack of unification which is the cause of all problems. One part of the being pulls one way, another pulls the other way, sometimes one is stronger and gives a certain orientation to life, sometimes it is the other and then the orientation suddenly changes, and the result is an incoherence. And as it is the <em>unsatisfied</em> part which usually comes to the surface to express its want of satisfaction, <em>so</em>, unless one is a sage, one is never satisfied with the life one leads and always misses the life one could have led—whether in one direction or the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3706">In your case there is something more. As your soul remains very closely linked with my being, as the contact with the supra-mental consciousness grows more and more total and constant, it acts very strongly on your soul like an almost irresistible attraction. This is what happened in 1958.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of the Mother II - 3707">To conclude, “an easy and pleasant life” can only satisfy the outer being; but what answers in the physical being to the soul’s influence needs for its flowering a life more in conformity with the soul’s needs and “languishes” when it cannot find it.</p>

Each section does not necessarily contain all of the statements that could be placed there. Each statement has been put only in one section, though it might have been put in more than one. Statements that appear in other volumes have not, as a rule, been reproduced here.</p>
