<em>Essays Divine and Human </em>consists of short prose pieces
	written by Sri Aurobindo after his arrival in Pondicherry in 1910
	but not published before his passing in 1950. Short prose works
	written during the same period and published during his lifetime
	appear in <em>Essays in Philosophy and Yoga</em>, volume 13 of THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SRI AUROBINDO
</p>
<p class="P">	There are indications in Sri Aurobindo's Pondicherry note books that
	he intended to bring out a collection of essays on yoga and other
	subjects. The headings written above two pieces, "Essays Divine and
	Human" and "Essays - Human and Divine", seem to have been intended as
	possible titles for this proposed book. The editors have chosen the
	first of these to be the title of the present volume.
	</p>
<p class="P">

	The material has been arranged in four parts:
	</p>
<p class="P">

	I. <em>Essays Divine and Human</em> - complete essays on yoga and
	related subjects, arranged in five chronological sections.
	</p>
<p class="P">

	II. <em>From Man to Superman: Notes and Fragments on Philosophy,
		Psychology and Yoga</em>, arranged in three thematic sections.
	</p>
<p class="P">

	III. <em>Notes and Fragments on Various Subjects</em>, arranged in
	five thematic sections.
	</p>
<p class="P">

	IV. <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em>, as arranged by the author in
	three sections, with a section of additional aphorisms.
	</p>
<p class="P">

	All the writings in this book have been reproduced from
	Sri Aurobindo's manuscripts. He did not prepare any of them for
	publication and left many in an unfinished state. Simple editorial
	problems arising from illegibility, incomplete revision, etc. are
	indicated by means of the system explained in the Guide to Editorial
	Notation on the next page. More complex problems are discussed in
	the reference volume.

<p class="P"> The contents of this volume were never prepared by Sri
	Aurobindo for publication. They have been transcribed from
	manuscripts that present a variety of textual difficulties. As far

	In the deep there is a greater deep, in the heights a greater height.
	Sooner shall man arrive at the borders of infinity than at the fulness of his own being.
	For that being is infinity, is God —
</p>
<p class="P">
	I aspire to infinite force, infinite knowledge, infinite bliss.
	Can I attain it?
	Yes, but the nature of infinity is that it has no end.
	Say not therefore that I attain it.
	I become it.
	Only so can man attain God by becoming God.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But before attaining he can enter into relations with him.
	To enter into relations with God is Yoga, the highest rapture<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1" href="#">1</a> and the
	noblest utility.
	There are relations within the compass of the humanity we have developed.
	These are called prayer, worship, adoration, sacrifice, thought, faith, science, philosophy.
	There are other relations beyond our developed capacity, but within the compass of the humanity we have yet to
	develop.
	Those are the relations that are attained by the various practices we usually call Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We may not know him as God, we may know him as Nature, our Higher Self, Infinity, some ineffable goal.
	It was so that Buddha approached Him; so approaches him the rigid Adwaitin.
	He is accessible even to the Atheist.
	To the materialist He disguises Himself in matter.
	For the Nihilist he waits ambushed in the bosom of Annihilation.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="moksha">Moksha</h1>
<p class="P">
	The pessimists have made moksha synonymous with annihilation or dissolution, but its true meaning is freedom.
	He who is free from bondage, is free, is mukta.
	But the last bondage is the passion for liberation itself which must be renounced before the soul can be perfectly
	free, and the last knowledge is the realisation that there is none bound, none desirous of freedom, but the soul is
	for ever and perfectly free, that bondage is an illusion and the liberation from bondage is an illusion.
	Not only are we bound but in play, the mimic knots are of such a nature that we ourselves can at our pleasure undo
	them.</p>
<p class="P">Nevertheless the bonds are many and intricate.
	The most difficult of all their knots is egoism, the delusion that we have an individual existence sufficient in
	itself, separate from the universal and only being, ekamevadwitiyam, who is one not only beyond Time, Space and
	Causality.
	Not only are we all Brahman in our nature and being, waves of one sea, but we are each of us Brahman in His
	entirety, for that which differentiates and limits us, nama and rupa, exists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="2" href="#">1</a> only in play and for the sake of the world-drama.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Whence then comes this delusion of egoism, if there is no separate existence and only Brahman is?
	We answer that there is separate existence but only in manifestation not in reality.
	It is as if one actor could play different parts not in succession but at one and the same moment; each part is He
	Himself, one and indivisible, but each part is different from the other.
	Brahman extends Himself in Time, Space and Causality which do not condition Him but exist in Him and can at any time
	be changed or abolished, and in Time, Space and Causality He attaches Himself to many namarupas which are merely
	existences in His universal being.
	They<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="3" href="#">2</a> are real in manifestation, unreal outside manifestation.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="man">Man
</h1>
<p class="P">The Shastras use the same word for man and the one divine and universal Being—Purusha—as if to lay stress
	upon the oneness of humanity with God. Nara and Narayana are the eternal couple, who, though they are two, are one,
	eternally different, eternally the same. Narayana, say the scholiasts, is he who dwells in the waters, but I rather
	think it means he who is the essence and sum of all humanity. Wherever there is a man, there there is Narayana; for
	the two cannot be separated. I think sometimes that when Christ spoke of himself as the Son of Man, he really meant
	the son of the Purusha, and almost find myself imagining that <em>anthropos</em> is only the clumsy Greek
	equivalent, the literal and ignorant translation of some Syrian word which corresponded to our Purusha.</p>
<p class="P">
	Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that man is full of divine possibilities — he is not merely a term in
	physical evolution, but himself the field of a spiritual evolution which with him began and in him will end.
	It was only when man was made, that the gods were satisfied — they who had rejected the animal forms, — and cried
	सुकृतमेव, “Man indeed is well and wonderfully made; the higher evolution can now begin.”
	He is like God, the sum of all other types and creatures from the ani mal to the god, infinitely variable where they
	are fixed, dynamic where they, even the highest, are static, and, therefore, although in the present and in his
	attainment a little lower than the angels, yet in the eventuality and in his culmination considerably higher than
	the gods.
	The other or fixed types, animals, gods, giants, Titans, demigods, can rise to a higher development than their own,
	but they must use the human body and the terrestrial birth to effect the transition.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="philosophy">Philosophy
</h1>
<p class="P">
	The knowledge which the man of pure intellect prefers to a more active and mundane curiosity, has in its
	surroundings a certain loftiness and serene detachment that cannot fail in their charm.
	To withdraw from contact with emotion and life and weave a luminous colourless shadowless web of thought, alone and
	far away in the infinite azure empyrean of pure ideas, can be an enthralling pastime fit for Titans or even for
	Gods.
	The ideas so found have always their value and it is no objection to their truth that, when tested by the rude
	ordeal of life and experience, they go to pieces.
	All that inopportune disaster proves is that they are no fit guides to ordinary human conduct; for material life
	which is the field of conduct is only intellectual on its mountaintops; in the plains and valleys ideas must undergo
	limitation by unideal conditions and withstand the shock of crude sub-ideal forces.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless conduct is a great part of our existence and the mere metaphysical, logical or scientific knowledge
	that either does not help me to act or even limits my self-manifestation through action, cannot be my only concern.
	For God has not set me here merely to think, to philosophise, to weave metaphysical systems, to play with words and
	syllogisms, but to act, love and know.
	I must act divinely so that I may become divine in being and deed; I must learn to love God not only in Himself but
	in all beings, appearances, objects, enjoyments, events, whether men call them good or bad, real or mythical,
	fortunate or calamitous; and I must know Him with the same divine impartiality and completeness in order that I may
	come to be like Him, perfect, pure and unlimited — that which all sons of Man must one day be.
	This, I cannot help thinking, is the meaning and purpose of the Lila.
	It is not true that because I think, I am; but rather because I think, feel and act, and even while I am doing any
	or all of these things, can transcend the thought, feeling and</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="P">

	action, therefore I am.
	Because I manifest, I am, and because I transcend manifestation, I am.
	The formula is not so clear and catching as the Cartesian, but there is a fuller truth in its greater
	comprehensiveness.</p>
<p class="P">
	The man of unalloyed intellect has a very high and difficult function; it is his function to teach men to think
	clearly and purely.
	In order to effect that for mankind, to carry reason as far as that somewhat stumbling and hesitating Pegasus will
	go, he sacrifices all the bypaths of mental enjoyment, the shady alleys and the moonlit gardens of the soul, in
	order that he may walk in rare air and a cold sunlight, living highly and austerely on the peaks of his mind and
	seeking God severely through knowledge.
	He treads down his emotions, because emotion distorts reason and replaces it by passions, desires, preferences,
	prejudices, prejudgments.
	He avoids life, because life awakes all his sensational being and puts his reason at the mercy of egoism, of
	sensational reactions of anger, fear, hope, hunger, ambition, instead of allowing it to act justly and do
	disinterested work.
	It becomes merely the paid pleader of a party, a cause, a creed, a dogma, an intellectual faction.
	Passion and eagerness, even intellectual eagerness, so disfigure the greatest minds that even Shankara becomes a
	sophist and a word-twister, and even Buddha argues in a circle.
	The philosopher wishes above all to preserve his intellectual righteousness; he is or should be as careful of his
	mental rectitude as the saint of his moral stainlessness.
	Therefore he avoids, as far as the world will let him, the conditions which disturb.
	But in this way he cuts himself off from experience and only the gods can know without experience.
	Sieyes said that politics was a subject of which he had made a science.
	He had, but the pity was that though he knew the science of politics perfectly, he did not know politics itself in
	the least and when he did enter political life, he had formed too rigidly the logical habit to replace it in any
	degree by the practical.
	If he had reversed the order or at least coordinated experiment with his theories before they were formed, he might
	have succeeded better.
	His ready-made Constitutions are monuments of logical perfection and practical ineffectiveness.
	They have the weakness of all logic; — granting your premises, your conclusion is all-triumphant; but then who is
	going to grant you your premises?
	There is nothing Fact and Destiny delight in so much as upsetting the logician's major and minor.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The logician thinks he has ensured himself against error when he has made a classification of particular fallacies;
	but he forgets the supreme and general fallacy, the fallacy of thinking that logic can, as a rule, prove anything
	but particular and partial propositions dealing with a fragmentary and one-sided truth.
	Logic?
	But Truth is not logical; it contains logic, but is not contained by it.
	A particular syllogism may be true, so far as it goes, covering a sharply limited set of facts, but even a set of
	syllogisms cannot exhaust truth on a general subject, for the simple reason that they necessarily ignore a number of
	equally valid premises, facts or possibilities which support a modified or contrary view.
	If one could arrive first at a conclusion, then at its exact opposite and, finally, harmonise the contradiction, one
	might arrive at some approach to the truth.
	But this is a process logic abhors.
	Its fundamental conception is that two contradictory statements cannot be true at the same time and place and in the
	same circumstances.
	Now, Fact and Nature and God laugh aloud when they hear the logician state his fundamental conception.
	For the universe is based on the simultaneous existence of contradictions covering the same time, place and
	circumstances.
	The elementary conception that God is at once One and Many, Finite and Infinite, Formed and Formless and that each
	attribute is the condition of the existence of its opposite, is a thing metaphysical logic has been boggling over
	ever since the reign of reason began.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 11</p>
<p class="P">
	The metaphysician thinks that he has got over the difficulty about the validity of premises by getting to the
	tattwas, the ideal truths of universal existence.
	Afterwards, he thinks, there can be no fear of confusion or error and by understanding and fixing them we shall be
	able to proceed from a sound basis to the rest of our task.
	He fashions his critique of reason, his system of pramanas, and launches himself into the wide inane.
	Alas, the tattwas are the very foundation, support and initial reason of this worldwide contradiction and logically
	impossible conciliation of opposites in which God has shadowed out some few rays of His luminous and infinite
	reality, — impossible to bind with the narrow links of a logical chain precisely because it is infinite.
	As for the pramanas, their manipulation is the instrument of all difference of opinion and the accompaniment to an
	unending jangle of debate.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Both the logician and the philosopher are apt to forget that they are dealing with words and words divorced from
	experience can be the most terrible misleaders in the world.
	Precisely because they are capable of giving us so much light, they are also capable of lighting us into
	impenetrable darkness.
	Tato bhuya iva te tamo ya u vidyayam ratah; “Deeper is the darkness into which they enter who are addicted to
	knowledge alone.”
	This sort of word worship and its resultant luminous darkness is very common in India and nowhere more than in the
	intellectualities of religion, so that when a man talks to me about the One and Maya and the Absolute, I am tempted
	to ask him, “My friend, how much have you experienced of these things in which you instruct me or how much are you
	telling me out of a vacuum or merely from intellectual appreciation?
	If you have merely ideas and no experience, you are no authority for me and your logic is to me but the clashing of
	cymbals good to deafen an opponent into silence, but of no use for knowledge.
	If you say you have experienced, then I have to ask you, ‘Are you sure you have measured all possible experience?’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="4" href="#">1</a>
	If you have not, then how can you be sure that my contradictory experience is not equally true?
	If you say you have, then I know you to be deluded or a pretender, one who has experienced a fragment or nothing;
	for God in His entire being is unknowable, avijnatam vijanatam.”
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 12</p>
<p class="P">
	The scientist thinks he has corrected the mistakes of the metaphysician because he refuses to deal with anything but
	a narrow and limited circle of facts and condemns everything else as hallucination, imposture and imagination.
	His parti pris, his fierce and settled prejudgments, his determined begging of the question are too obvious and well
	known to need particular illustration.
	He forgets that all experiences are facts, that ideas are facts, that subjective knowledge is the one fact of which
	he can be decently sure and that he knows nothing even of the material world by his senses but only by the use his
	subjective knowledge makes of the senses.
	Many a materialist will tell you that only those facts can be accepted as a basis to knowledge which the senses
	supply, — a position which no man can substantiate and which his science daily denies in practice.
	These reasoners consent to trust to their sovereign subjective instrument when it settles for them the truths about
	this world visible to their lower instruments, but the same sovereign instrument is condemned as wholly fallacious
	and insane when it deals in precisely the same way with another field of perceptions and experiences.
	When my subjective experience tells him, “I am hungry”, he consents; “Of course, you must be since you say so.”
	But let it tell him, “I am full of bliss from an immaterial source”; or “By certain higher instruments repeatedly
	tested I know that I have wandered in regions illuminated by no material sun,” and he answers, “You are only fit for
	the gaol or the lunatic asylum.”
	No one has seen the earth whirling round the sun, indeed we see daily the opposite, yet he holds the first opinion
	obstinately, but if you say “Although God is not seen of men, yet He exists,” he turns from you angrily and stalks
	into his laboratory.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The practical man avoids error by refusing to think at all.
	His method at least cannot be right.
	It is not right even for the practical uses he prefers exclusively to all others.
	You see him stumbling into some pit because he refuses to walk with a light and then accusing adverse circumstances
	or his evil fortune, or he shouts, elbows, jostles, tumbles and stumbles himself into a final success and departs at
	last, satisfied; leaving behind a name in history and a legacy of falsehood, evil and suffering to unborn
	generations.
	The method of the practical man is the shortest and most facile, but the least admirable of all.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 13</p>
<p class="P">
	Truth is an infinitely complex reality and he has the best chance of arriving nearest to it who most recognises but
	is not daunted by its infinite complexity.
	We must look at the whole thought-tangle, fact, emotion, idea, truth beyond idea, conclusion, contradiction,
	modification, ideal, practice, possibility, impossibility (which must be yet attempted,) and keeping the soul calm
	and the eye clear in this mighty flux and gurge of the world, seek everywhere for some word of harmony, not
	forgetting immediate in ultimate truth, nor ultimate in immediate, but giving each its due place and portion in the
	Infinite Purpose.
	Some minds, like Plato, like Vivekananda, feel more than others this mighty complexity and give voice to it.
	They pour out thought in torrents or in rich and majestic streams.
	They are not logically careful of consistency, they cannot build up any coherent, yet comprehensive systems, but
	they quicken men's minds and liberate them from religious, philosophic and scientific dogma and tradition.
	They leave the world not surer, but freer than when they entered it.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Some men seek to find the truth by imaginative perception.
	It is a good instrument like logic, but like logic it breaks down before it reaches the goal.
	Neither ought to be allowed to do more than take us some way and then leave us.
	Others think that a fine judgment can arrive at the true balance.
	It does, for a time; but the next generation upsets that fine balancing, consenting to a coarser test or demanding a
	finer.
	The religious prefer inspiration, but inspiration is like the lightning, brilliantly illuminating only a given reach
	of country and leaving the rest in darkness intensified by the sharpness of that light.
	Vast is our error if we mistake that bit of country for the whole universe.
	Is there then no instrument of knowledge that can give us the heart of truth and provide us with the key word of
	existence?
	I think there is, but the evolution of mankind at large yet falls far short of it; their highest tread only on the
	border of that illumination.
	After all pure intellect carries us very high.
	But neither the scorner of pure intellectual ideation, nor its fanatic and devotee can attain to the knowledge in
	which not only the senses reflect or the mind thinks about things, but the ideal faculty directly knows them.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-siddhis">The Siddhis

</h1>
<p class="P">
	S<b>ome</b> men sneer at the Siddhis because they do not believe in them, others because they think it is noble and
	spiritual to despise them.
	Both attitudes proceed from ignorance.
	It is true that to some natures the rule of omne ignotum pro magnifico holds and everything that is beyond their
	knowledge is readily accepted as true marvel and miracle, and of such a temper are the credulous made, it is also
	true that to others it is omne ignotum pro falso and they cannot forbear ridiculing as fraud or pitiable
	superstition everything that is outside the reach of their philosophy.
	This is the temper of the incredulous.
	But the true temper is to be neither credulous nor incredulous, but calmly and patiently to inquire.
	Let the inquiry be scrupulous, but also scrupulously fair on both sides.
	Some think it shows superior rationality, even when they inquire, to be severe, and by that they mean to seize every
	opportunity of disproving the phenomenon offered to their attention.
	Such an attitude is good rather for limiting knowledge than increasing it.
	If it saves us from some errors of assertion, it betrays us into many errors of negation and postpones developments
	of the utmost importance to our human advance.

	I do not wish to argue the question of the existence or nonexistence of Yogic siddhis; for it is not with me a
	question of debate, or of belief and disbelief, since I know by daily experience that they exist.
	I am concerned rather with their exact nature and utility.
	And here one is met by the now fashionable habit, among people presuming to be Vedantic and spiritual, of a
	denunciation and holy horror of the Yogic siddhis.
	They are, it seems, Tantric, dangerous, immoral, delusive as conjuring tricks, a stumbling block in the path of the
	soul's liberation.
	Swami Vivekananda did much to encourage this attitude by his eagerness to avoid all mention of them at the outset of
	his mission in order not to startle the incredulity of the Europeans.
	“These things are true” he said, “but let them lie hidden.”
	And now many who have not the motives of Vivekananda, think that they can ape his spiritual greatness by imitating
	his limitations.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 16</p>
<p class="P">
	There was no such weakness in the robust temperament of our forefathers.
	Our great Rishis of old did not cry out upon Siddhis, but recognised them as a part, though not the most important
	part of Yogic accomplishment, and used them with an abundant and unhesitating vigour.
	They<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="5" href="#">1</a> are recognised in our sacred books, formally included in Yoga by so
	devotional a Purana as the Bhagawat, noted and some of their processes carefully tabled by Patanjali.
	Even in the midnight of the Kali great Siddhas and saints have used them more sparingly, but with power and
	effectiveness.
	It would be difficult for many of them to do otherwise than use the siddhis since by the very fact of their
	spiritual elevation, these powers have become not exceptional movements, but the ordinary processes of their thought
	and action.
	It is by the use of the siddhis that the Siddhas sitting on the mountains help the world out of the heart of their
	solitude and silence.
	Jesus Christ made the use of the siddhis a prominent feature of his pure, noble and spiritual life, nor did he
	hesitate to communicate them to his disciples — the laying of hands, the healing of the sick, the ashirvada, the
	abhishap, the speaking with many tongues were all given to them.
	The day of Pentecost is still kept holy by the Christian Church.
	Joan of Arc used her siddhis to liberate France.
	Socrates had his siddhis, some of them of a very material nature.
	Men of great genius are usually born with some of them and use them unconsciously.
	Even in natures far below the power and clarity of genius we see their occasional or irregular operation.
	The West, always avid of knowledge, is struggling, sadly hampered by misuse and imposture, to develop them and
	gropes roughly for the truth about them in the phenomena of hypnotism, clairvoyance, telepathy, vouched for by men
	and women of great intellectuality and sincerity.
	Returning Eastwards, where only their right practice has been understood, the lives of our saints northern and
	southern are full of the record of Siddhis.
	Sri Ramakrishna, whose authority is quoted against them, not only made inward use of them but manifested them with
	no inconsiderable frequency in His lila.
	I see nothing in this long record immoral, dangerous or frivolous.
	But because Europe looks with scorn and incredulity on these “miracles” and this “magic”, we too must needs be
	ashamed of them, hustle them into the background and plead that only a few charlatans and followers of false paths
	profess their use.
	But as for us, we are men of intellect and spirituality, ascetics, devotees, self-deniers, Vedantins; for these
	things we are too high and we leave them to Theosophists, immoral Tantrics and deluded pseudo-Yogins.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 17</p>
<p class="P">
	Let us have done with cant and pretension in all matters.
	There are no such things as miracles in this world of divine processes, for either there is no such thing as a
	miracle or, if we consider more closely, everything in this world is a miracle.
	A miracle is, literally, a marvel, a thing to be wondered at — so long as the process is [not] known.
	Wireless telegraphy is a great marvel, the speechless passage of a thought from brain to brain is a yet greater, yet
	it happens daily even in the most commonplace minds and existences.
	But when the process is known, nothing is left to be wondered at except the admirable greatness of wisdom, width and
	variety of conception and subtlety and minuteness in execution with which this universe is managed.
	And even that wonder ceases when we know God and realise that the most wonderful movements of the cosmos are but
	trifles and “conjuring-tricks” compared with His infinite Reality.
	And as it is with this siddhi of science which we call wireless telegraphy and with this other siddhi of nature
	which is exampled in the momentary or rapid spread of a single thought or emotion in a mob, a nation, an army, so it
	is with the Yogic siddhis.
	Explain and master their processes, put them in their proper relation to the rest of the economy of the universe and
	we shall find that they are neither miraculous nor marvellous nor supernatural.
	They<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="6" href="#">2</a> are supernormal only in the way in which aviation is supernormal or
	motoring or the Chinese alphabet.
	Nor is there anything magical in them except in so far as magic, the science of the Persian Magi, means originally
	and properly the operations of superior power or superior knowledge.
	And in that sense the occultism of the present day is magic precisely in the same sense as the scientific
	experiments of Roger Bacon or Paracelsus.
	There is a good deal of fraud and error and self-deception mixed up with it, but so there was with the earliest
	efforts of the European scientists.
	The defects of Western practitioners or Eastern quacks do not get rid of our true and ancient Yoga.

	The Psychology of Yoga
</h1>
<p class="P">
	Yoga is not a modern invention of the human mind, but our ancient and prehistoric possession.
	The Veda is our oldest extant human document and the Veda, from one point of view, is a great compilation of
	practical hints about Yoga.
	All religion is a flower of which Yoga is the root; all philosophy, poetry and the works of genius use it,
	consciously or unconsciously, as an instrument.
	We believe that God created the world by Yoga and by Yoga He will draw it into Himself again.
	Yogah prabhavapyayau, Yoga is the birth and passing away of things.
	When Srikrishna reveals to Arjuna the greatness of His creation and the manner in which He has built it out of His
	being by a reconciliation of logical opposites, he says “Pasya me yogam aishwaram”, Behold my divine Yoga.
	We usually attach a more limited sense to the word; when we use or hear it, we think of the details of Patanjali's
	system, of rhythmic breathing, of peculiar ways of sitting, of concentration of mind, of the trance of the adept.
	But these are merely details of particular<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7" href="#">1</a> systems.
	The systems are not the thing itself, any more than the water of an irrigation canal is the river Ganges.
	Yoga may be done without the least thought for the breathing, in any posture or no posture, without any insistence
	on concentration, in the full waking condition, while walking, working, eating, drinking, talking with others, in
	any occupation, in sleep, in dream, in states of unconsciousness, semiconsciousness, double-consciousness.
	It is no nostrum or system or fixed practice, but an eternal fact of process based on the very nature of the
	Universe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 19</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless in practice the name may be limited to certain applications of this general process for specific and
	definite ends.
	Yoga stands essentially on the fact that in this world we are everywhere one, yet divided; one yet divided in our
	being, one with yet divided from our fellow creatures of all kinds, one with yet divided from the infinite existence
	which we call God, Nature or Brahman.
	Yoga, generally, is the power which the soul in one body has of entering into effective relation with other souls,
	with parts of itself which are behind the waking consciousness, with forces of Nature and objects in Nature, with
	the Supreme Intelligence, Power and Bliss which governs the world either for the sake of that union in itself or for
	the purpose of increasing or modifying our manifest being, knowledge, faculty, force or delight.
	Any system which organises our inner being and our outer frame for these ends may be called a system of Yoga.

	Na Kinchidapi Chintayet
</h1>
<p class="P">The cessation of thought is the one thing which the believer in intellect as the highest term of our
	evolution cannot contemplate with equanimity. To master the fleeting randomness of thought by regulating the
	intellectual powers and thinking consecutively and clearly is an ideal he can understand. But to still this higher
	development of thought seems to him the negation of human activity, a reversion to the condition of the stone. Yet
	it is certain that it is only by the stilling of the lower that the higher gets full play. So long as the body and
	the vital desires are active the mind is necessarily distracted and it is only when the body is forgotten and the
	vital part consents to quietude that a man can concentrate himself in thought and follow undisturbed the consecutive
	development whether of a train of reasoning or a train of inspiration. Not only is this so, but the higher faculties
	of the mind can only work at their best when the lower are quieted. If the accumulations in the chitta, the
	recording part of the mind, are continually active, full as it is of preconceived ideas, prejudices, predilections,
	the great mass of previous <em>sanskaras</em>, the reflective mind which is ordinarily called the reason is
	obstructed in its work and comes to false conclusions. It is essential for the faculties of the reason to be freed
	as far as may be from this ever increasing accumulation of thought-sensations good and bad, false and true which we
	call mind—manas. It is this freedom which is called the scientific spirit. To form no conclusions which are not
	justified by observation and reasoning, to doubt everything until it is proved but to deny nothing until it is
	disproved, to be always ready to reconsider old conclusions in the light of new facts, to give a candid
	consideration to every new idea or old idea revived if it deserves a hearing, no matter how contradictory it may be
	of previously ascertained experience or previously formed conclusion, is the sceptical temper, the temper</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 25</p>
<p class="P"> that the bodily consciousness is annulled and in the acme of the <em>samadhi</em> a man can be cut or
	burned without being aware of the physical suffering. Even before the concentration is begun the forgetfulness
	acquired is sufficient to prevent any intrusion upon the mind except under a more than ordinarily powerful physical
	stimulus. After this point has been reached the Yoga proceeds to the processes of pranayam by which the whole system
	is cleared of impurities and the <em>pranasakti</em>, the great cosmic energy which lies behind all processes of
	Nature, fills the body and the brain and becomes sufficient for any work of which man is actually or potentially
	capable. This is followed by concentration. The first process is to withdraw the senses into the mind. This is
	partly done in the ordinary process of absorption of which every thinking man is capable. To concentrate upon the
	work in hand whether it be a manual process, a train of thought, a scientific experiment or a train of inspiration,
	is the first condition of complete capacity and it is the process by which mankind has been preparing itself for
	Yoga. To concentrate means to be absorbed; but absorption may be more or less complete. When it is so complete that
	for all practical purposes the knowledge of outward things ceases, then the first step has been taken towards Yogic
	absorption. We need not go into the stages of that absorption rising from pratyahar to samadhi and from the lower
	samadhi to the higher. The principle is to intensify absorption. It is intensified in quality by the entire
	cessation of outward knowledge, the senses are withdrawn into the mind, the mind into the buddhi or supermind, the
	supermind into Knowledge, Vijnana, Mahat, out of which all things proceed and in which all things exist. It is
	intensified in quantity or content; instead of absorption in a set of thoughts or a train of intuitions, the Yogin
	concentrates his absorption on a single thought, a single image, a single piece of knowledge, and it is his
	experience that whatever he thus concentrates on, he masters,—he becomes its lord and does with it what he wills. By
	knowledge he attains to mastery of the world. The final goal of Rajayoga is the annulment of separate consciousness
	and complete communion with that which alone is whether we call Him Parabrahman or Parameshwara,</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 26</p>
<p class="P">
	In the Gita we have a process which is not the process of Raja-Yoga.
	It seeks a short cut to the common aim and goes straight to the stillness of the mind.
	After putting away desire and fear the Yogin sits down and performs upon his thoughts a process of reining in by
	which they get accustomed to an inward motion.
	Instead of allowing the mind to flow outward, he compels it to rise and fall within, and if he sees, hears, feels or
	smells outward objects he pays no attention to them and draws the mind always inward.
	This process he pursues until the mind ceases to send up thoughts connected with outward things.
	The result is that fresh thoughts do not accumulate in the chitta at the time of meditation, but only the old ones
	rise.
	If the process be farther pursued by rejecting these thoughts as they rise in the mind, in other words by
	dissociating the thinker from the mind, the operator from the machine and refusing to sanction the continuance of
	the machine's activity, the result is perfect stillness.
	This can be done if the thinker whose interest is necessary to the mind, refuses to be interested and becomes
	passive.
	The mind goes on for a while by its own impetus just as a locomotive does when the steam is shut off, but a time
	must come when it will slow down and stop<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="10" href="#">3</a> altogether.
	This is the moment towards which the process moves.
	Na kinchid api Chintayet: — the Yogin should not think of anything at all.
	Blank cessation of mental activity is aimed at leaving only the sakshi, the witness watching for results.
	If at this moment the Yogin entrusts himself to the guidance of the universal Teacher within himself, Yoga will
	fulfil itself without any farther effort on his part.
	The passivity will be confirmed, the higher faculties will awake and the cosmic Force passing down from the vijnana
	through the supermind will take charge of the whole machine and direct its workings as the Infinite Lord of All may
	choose.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 27</p>
<p class="P">
	Whichever of the two methods be chosen, the result is the same.
	The mind is stilled, the higher faculties awakened.
	This stillness of the mind is not altogether a new idea or peculiar to India.
	The old Highland poets had the secret.
	When they wished to compose poetry, they first stilled the mind, became entirely passive and waited for the
	inspiration to flow into them.
	This habit of yogic passivity, a relic doubtless of the discipline of the Druids, was the source of those faculties
	of second sight and other psychic powers which are so much more common in this Celtic race than in the other peoples
	of Europe.
	The phenomena of inspiration are directly connected with these higher faculties of which we find rudiments or
	sporadic traces in the past history of human experience.

	The Sources of Poetry
</h1>
<p class="P">The swiftness of the muse has been embodied in the image of Pegasus, the heavenly horse
	of Greek legend; it was from the rapid beat of his hoofs on the rock that Hippocrene flowed.
	The waters of Poetry flow in a current or a torrent; where there is a pause or a denial, it is a sign of
	obstruction in the stream or of imperfection in the mind which the waters have chosen for their bed and
	continent.
	In India we have the same idea; Saraswati is for us the goddess of poetry, and her name means the stream
	or “she who has flowing motion”.
	But even Saraswati is only an intermediary.
	Ganga is the real mother of inspiration, she who flows impetuously down from the head of Mahadev, God
	high-seated, over the Himalay<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11" href="#">1</a> of the mind to the homes and cities of
	men.
	All poetry is an inspiration, a thing breathed into the thinking organ from above; it is recorded in the
	mind, but is born in the higher principle of direct knowledge or ideal vision which surpasses mind.
	It is in reality a revelation.
	The prophetic or revealing power sees the substance; the inspiration perceives the right
	expression.
	Neither is manufactured; nor is poetry really a poiesis or composition, nor even a creation, but rather
	the revelation of something that eternally exists.
	The ancients knew this truth and used the same word for poet and prophet, creator and seer,
	<em>sophos</em>, <em>vates</em>, <em>kavi</em>.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="P">But there are differences in the manifestation.
	The greatest motion of poetry comes when the mind is still and the ideal principle works above and
	outside the brain, above even the hundred petalled lotus of the ideal mind, in its proper empire; for then it is
	Veda that is revealed, the perfect substance and expression of eternal truth.
	This<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="12" href="#">2</a> higher ideation transcends genius just as genius
	transcends ordinary intellect and perception.
	But that great faculty is still beyond the normal level of our evolution.
	Usually we see the action of the revelation and inspiration reproduced by a secondary, diluted and
	uncertain process in the mind.
	But even this secondary and inferior action is so great that it can give us Shakespeare, Homer and
	Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="13" href="#">3</a>.
	There is also a tertiary and yet more common action of the inspiration.
	For of our three mental instruments of knowledge, — the heart or emotionally realising mind, the
	observing and reasoning intellect with its aids, fancy and memory, and the intuitive intellect, — it is into the
	last and highest that the ideal principle transmits its inspirations when the greatest poetry writes itself out
	through the medium of the poet.
	But if the intuitive intellect is not strong enough to act habitually, it is better for the poetry to
	descend into the heart and return to the intellect suffused and coloured with passion and emotion than to be formed
	directly in the observing intellect.
</p>
<p class="P">Poetry written from the reasoning intellect is apt to be full of ingenious conceits, logic,
	argumentation, rhetorical turns, ornamental fancies, echoes learned and imitative rather than uplifted and
	transformed.
	This is what is sometimes called classical poetry, the vigorous and excellent but unemotional and
	unuplifted poetry of Pope and Dryden.
	It has its inspiration, its truth and value; it is admirable in its way, but it is only great when it is
	lifted out of itself into intuitive writing or else invaded by the heart.
	For everything that needs fire rather than light, driving-force rather than clearness, enthusiasm rather
	than correctness, the heart is obviously the more potent instrument.
	Now, poetry to be great must have either enthusiasm or ecstasy.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 30</p>
<p class="P">Yet the poetry that rises up from the heart is usually a turbid stream; our own restless ideas
	and imaginations mix with the pure inrush from above a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="14" href="#">4</a> turbulent uprush
	from below, our excited emotions seek an exaggerated expression, our aesthetic habits and predilections busy
	themselves to demand a satisfaction greatly beyond their due.
	Such poetry may be inspired, but it is not always suitable or inevitable.
	There is often a double inspiration, the higher or ecstatic and the lower or emotional, and the lower
	disturbs and drags down the higher.
	This is the birth of romantic or excessively exuberant poetry, too rich in expression, too abundant and
	redundant in substance.
	The best poetry coming straight from the right centres may be bare and strong, unadorned and lofty, or it
	may be rich and splendid; it may be at will romantic or classical; but it will always be felt to be the right thing
	for its purpose; it is always nobly or rapturously inevitable.
</p>
<p class="P">But even in the higher centres of the intuitive intellect there may be defects in the
	inspiration.
	There is a kind of false fluency which misses the true language of poetry from dulness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="15" href="#">5</a> of perception.
	Under the impression that it is true and inspired writing it flows with an imperturbable flatness, saying
	the thing that should be said but not in the way that it should be said, without force and felicity.
	This is the tamasic or clouded stimulus, active, but full of unenlightenment and
	self-ignorance.
	The thing seen is right and good; accompanied with the inspired expression it would make very noble
	poetry.
	Instead, it becomes prose rendered unnatural and difficult to tolerate by being cut up into
	lengths.
	Wordsworth is the most characteristic and interesting victim of tamasic stimulus.
	Other great poets fall a prey to it, but that superb and imperturbable self-satisfaction under the
	infliction is his alone.
	There is another species of tamasic stimulus which transmits an inspired and faultless expression, but
	the substance is neither interesting to man nor pleasing to the gods.
	A good deal of Milton comes under this category.
	In both cases what has happened is that either the inspiration or the revelation has been active, but its
	companion activity has refused to associate itself in the work.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 31</p>
<p class="P">It is when the mind works at the form and substance of poetry without either the revelation or
	the inspiration from above that respectable or minor poetry is produced.
	Judgment, memory and imagination may work, command of language may be there, but without that secondary
	action of a higher than intellectual force, it is labour wasted, work that earns respect but not
	immortality.
	Doggerel and bastard poetry take their rise not even in the observing intellect but from the sensational
	mind or the passive memory guided only by the mere physical pleasure of sound and emotion.
	It is bold, blatant, external, imitative, vulgar; its range of intellectuality and imaginativeness cannot
	go beyond the vital impulse and the vital delight.
	But even in the sensational mind there is the possibility of a remote action from the ideal self; for
	even to the animals who think sensationally only, God has given revelations and inspirations which we call
	instincts.
	Under such circumstances even bastard poetry may have a kind of worth, a kind of inevitability<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="16" href="#">6</a>.
	The poet in the sensational man may be entirely satisfied and delighted, and even in the more developed
	human being the sensational element may find a poetical satisfaction not of the highest.
	The best ballad poetry and Macaulay's lays are instances in point.
	Scott is a sort of link between sensational and intellectual poetry.
	While there are men mainly sensational, secondarily intellectual and not at all ideal, he will always be
	admired.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 32</p>
<p class="P">Another kind of false inspiration is the rajasic or fiery stimulus.
	It is not flat and unprofitable like the tamasic, but hasty, impatient and vain.
	It is eager to avoid labour by catching at the second best expression or the incomplete vision of the
	idea, insufficiently jealous to secure the best form, the most satisfying substance.
	Rajasic poets, even when they feel the defect in what they have written, hesitate to sacrifice it because
	they also feel and are attached either to what in it is valuable or to the memory of their delight when it was first
	written.
	If they get a better expression or a fuller sight, they often prefer to reiterate rather than strike out
	inferior stuff with which they are in love.
	Sometimes, drifting or struggling helplessly along that shallow and vehement current, they vary one idea
	or harp on the same imagination without any final success in expressing it inevitably.
	Examples of the rajasic stimulus are commonest in Shelley and Spenser, but few English poets are free
	from it.
	This is the rajasic fault in expression.
	But the fiery stimulus also perverts or hampers the substance.
	An absence of self-restraint, an unwillingness to restrict and limit the ideas and imaginations is a sure
	sign of a rajasic ideality.
	There is an attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of the subject, to expand and multiply thoughts and
	imaginative visions beyond the bounds of the right and permissible.
	Or else the true idea is rejected or fatally anticipated by another which is or seems to be more catching
	and boldly effective.
	Keats is the principle<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="17" href="#">7</a> exemplar of the first tendency, the
	Elizabethans of the second.
	The earlier work of Shakespeare abounds with classical instances.
	As distinguished from the Greek, English is a pronouncedly<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="18" href="#">8</a>
	rajasic literature and, though there is much in it that is more splendid than almost anything done by the Greeks, —
	more splendid, not better, — a great deal even of its admired portions are rather rich or meretricious than great
	and true.
</p>
<p class="P">The perfect inspiration in the intuitive intellect is the sattwic or luminous inspiration, which
	is disinterested, self-contained, yet at will noble, rich or vigorous, having its eye only on the right thing to be
	said and the right way to say it.
	It does not allow its perfection to be interfered with by emotion or eagerness, but this does not shut it
	out from ecstasy and exaltation.
	On the contrary, its delight of self-enjoyment is a purer and more exquisite enthusiasm than that which
	attends any other inspiration.
	It commands and uses emotion without enslaving itself to it.
	There is indeed a sattwic stimulus which is attached to its own luminosity, limpidity and steadiness, and
	avoids richness, force or emotion of a poignant character even when these are needed and appropriate.
	The poetry of Matthew Arnold is often though not always of this character.
	But this is a limited inspiration.
	Sattwic as well as rajasic poetry may be written from the uninspired intellect, but the sensational mind
	never gives birth to sattwic poetry.
</p>
<p class="P">One thing has to be added.
	A poet need not be a reflective critic; he need not have the reasoning and analysing intellect and
	dissect his own poetry.
	But two things he must have in some measure to be perfect, the intuitive judgment which shows him at a
	glance whether he has got the best or the second-best idea, the perfect or the imperfect expression and rhythm, and
	the intuitive reason which shows him without analysis why or wherein it is best or second-best, perfect or
	imperfect.
	These four faculties, revelation or prophecy, inspiration, intuitive judgment and intuitive reason, are
	the perfect equipment of genius doing the works of interpretative and creative knowledge.

	The Interpretation of Scripture
</h1>
<p class="P">The spirit who lies concealed behind the material world, has given us, through the
	inspiration of great seers, the Scriptures<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="19" href="#">1</a> as helpers and guides to
	unapparent truth, lamps of great power that send their rays into the darkness of the unknown beyond which He dwells,
	<em>tamasah parastat</em>.
	They are guides to knowledge, brief indications to enlighten us on our path, not substitutes for thought
	and experience.
	They are <em>shabdam Brahma</em>, the Word, the oral expression of God, not the thing
	to be known itself nor the knowledge of Him.
	<em>Shabdam</em> has three elements, the word, the meaning and the spirit.
	The word is a symbol, <em>vak</em> or <em>nama</em>; we have to find the <em>artha</em>, the meaning or form of thought which the symbol indicates. But the meaning itself is only the indication of something deeper which the thought seeks to convey to the intellectual conception. For not only words, but ideas also are eventually no more than symbols of a knowledge which is beyond ideas and words. Therefore it comes that no idea by itself is wholly true.
	There is indeed a <em>rupa</em>, some concrete or abstract form of knowledge, answering to every name, and it is that which the meaning must present to the intellect. We say a form of knowledge, because according to our philosophy, all things are forms of an essentially unknowable existence which reveals them as forms of knowledge to the essential awareness in its Self, its Atman or Spirit, the Chit in the Sat.
	But beyond <em>nama</em> and <em>rupa</em> is <em>swarupa</em>, the essential figure of Truth, which we cannot know with the intellect, but only
	with a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">2</a> higher faculty.
	And every <em>swarupa</em> is itself only a symbol of the one essential existence which
	can only be known by its symbols because in its ultimate reality it defies logic and exceeds perception, —
	God.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 34</p>
<p class="P">Since the knowledge the Scripture conveys is so deep, difficult and subtle, — if it were easy
	what would be the need of the Scripture? — the interpreter cannot be too careful or too perfectly
	trained.
	He must not be one who will rest content in the thought-symbol or in the logical implications<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="21" href="#">3</a> of the idea; he must hunger and thirst for what is
	beyond.
	The interpreter who stops short with the letter, is the slave of a symbol and convicted of
	error.
	The interpreter who cannot go beyond the external meaning, is the prisoner of his thought and rests in a
	partial and incomplete knowledge.
	One must transgress limits and penetrate to the knowledge behind, which must be experienced before it can
	be known; for the ear hears it, the intellect observes it, but the spirit alone can possess it.
	Realisation in the self of things is the only knowledge; all else is mere idea or opinion.
</p>
<p class="P">The interpretation of the Veda is hampered by many human irrelevancies<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="22" href="#">4</a>.
	Men set up an authority and put it between themselves and knowledge.
	The orthodox are indignant that a mere modern should presume to differ from Shankara in interpreting the
	Vedanta or from Sayana in interpreting the Veda.
	They forget that Shankara and Sayana are themselves moderns, separated from ourselves by some hundreds of
	years only, but the Vedas are many thousands of years old.
	The commentator ought to be studied, but instead we put him in place of the text.
	Good commentaries are always helpful even when they are wrong, but the best cannot be allowed to fetter
	inquiry.
	Sayana's commentary on the Veda helps me by showing what a man of great erudition some hundreds of years
	ago thought to be the sense of the Scripture.
	But I cannot forget that even at the time of the Brahmanas the meaning of the Veda had become dark to the
	men of that prehistoric age.
	Shankara's commentary on the Upanishads helps me by showing what a man of immense metaphysical genius and
	rare logical force after arriving at some fundamental realisations thought to be the sense of the
	Vedanta.
	But it is evident that he is often at a loss and always prepossessed by the necessity of justifying his
	philosophy.
	I find that Shankara had grasped much of Vedantic truth, but that much was dark to him.
	I am bound to admit what he realised; I am not bound to exclude what he failed to realise.
	<em>Aptavakyam</em>, authority, is one kind of proof; it is not the only kind: <em>pratyaksha</em> is more important.
	</em></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="P"> The heterodox on the other hand swear by Max Muller and the Europeans.
	It is enough for them that Max Muller should have found henotheism in the Vedas for the Vedas to be
	henotheistic.
	The Europeans have seen in our Veda only the rude chants of an antique and primitive pastoral race sung
	in honour of the forces of Nature, and for many their opinion is conclusive of the significance of the <em>mantras</em>.
	All other interpretation is to them superstitious.
	But to me the ingenious guesses of foreign grammarians are of no more authority than the ingenious
	guesses of Sayana.
	It is irrelevant to me what Max Muller thinks of the Veda or what Sayana thinks of the Veda.
	I should prefer to know what the Veda has to say for itself and, if there is any light there on the
	unknown or on the infinite, to follow the ray till I come face to face with that which it illumines.
</span></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 36</p>
<p class="P">There<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="23" href="#">5</a> are those who follow neither Sayana and
	Shankara nor the Europeans<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24" href="#">6</a>, but interpret Veda and Vedanta for
	themselves, yet permit themselves to be the slaves of another kind of irrelevancy.
	They come to the Veda with a preconceived and established opinion and seek in it a support for some
	trifling polemic; they degrade it to the position of a backer in an intellectual prizefight.
	Opinions are not knowledge, they are only sidelights on knowledge.
	Most often they are illegitimate extensions of an imperfect knowledge.
	A man has perhaps travelled to England and seen Cumberland and the lakes; he comes back and imagines
	England ever after as a country full of verdant mountains, faery woodlands, peaceful and enchanted
	waters.
	Another has been to the manufacturing centres; he imagines England as a great roaring workshop, crammed
	with furnaces and the hum of machinery and the smell of metal.
	Another has sojourned in the quiet country-side and to him England is all hedges and lanes and the
	daisy-sprinkled meadow and the well-tilled field.
	All have realised a little, but none have realised England.
	Then there is the man who has only read about the country or heard descriptions from others and thinks he
	knows it better than the men who have been there.
	They may all admit that what they have seen need not be the whole, but each has his little ineffaceable
	picture which, because it is all he has realised, persists in standing for the whole.
	There is no harm in that, no harm whatever in limitation if you understand and admit the
	limitation.
	But if all the four begin quarrelling, what an aimless confusion will arise!
	That is what has happened in India because of the excessive logicality and too robust opinionativeness of
	Southern metaphysicians.
	We should come back to a more flexible and rational spirit of inquiry.
</p>
<p class="P">What then are the standards of truth in the interpretation of the Scripture?
	The standards are three, the knower, knowledge and the known.
</p>
<p class="P">The known is the text itself that we seek to interpret.
	We must be sure we have the right word, not an emendation to suit the exigency of some individual or
	sectarian opinion; the right etymology and shade of meaning, not one that is traditional or forced to serve the ends
	of a commentator; the right spirit in the sense, not an imported or too narrow or too elastic spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">The knower is the original <em>drashta</em> or seer of the <em>mantra</em>, with whom we ought to be in spiritual contact.
	If knowledge is indeed a perishable thing in a perishable instrument, such contact is impossible; but in
	that case the Scripture itself must be false and not worth considering.
	If there is any truth in what the Scripture says, knowledge is eternal and inherent in all of us and what
	another saw I can see, what another realised I can realise.
	The <em>drashta</em> was a soul in relation with the infinite Spirit, I am also<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="25" href="#">7</a> a soul in relation with the infinite Spirit.
	We have a meeting-place, a possibility of communion.
</span></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 37</p>
<p class="P">Knowledge is the eternal truth, part of which the <em>drashta</em> expresses
	to us.
	Through the part he shows us, we must travel to the whole, otherwise we shall be subject to the errors
	incidental to an imperfect knowledge.
	If even the part is to be rightly understood, it must be viewed in the terms of the whole, not the whole
	in the terms of the part.
	I am not limited by the Scriptures; on the contrary I must exceed them in order to be master of their
	knowledge.
	It is true that we are usually the slaves of our individual and limited outlook, but our capacity is
	unlimited, and, if we can get rid of <em>ahankara</em>, if we can put ourselves at the service of
	the Infinite without any reservation of predilection or opinion, there is no reason why our realisation should be
	limited.
	<em>Tasmin vijnate sarvam vijnatam</em>.
	He being known, all can be known.
	To understand Scripture, it is not enough to be a scholar, one must be a soul.
	To know what the <em>drashta</em> saw one must oneself have <em>drishti</em>, sight, and be a student if not a master of the knowledge.
	<em>Atha para yaya tad aksharam adhigamyate</em>.
	Grammar, etymology, prosody, astronomy, metaphysics, logic, all that is good; but afterwards there is
	still needed the higher knowledge by which the Immutable is known.

	On Original Thinking
</h1>
<p class="P">The attitude of mankind towards originality of opinion is marked by a natural hesitation and
	inconsistency.
	Admired for its rarity, brilliancy and potency, yet in practice and for the same qualities it is more
	generally dreaded, ridiculed or feared.
	There is no doubt that it tends to disturb what is established.
	Therefore tamasic men and tamasic states of society take especial pains to discourage independence of
	opinion.
	Their watchword is authority.
	Few societies have been so tamasic, so full of inertia and contentment in increasing narrowness as Indian
	society in later times; few have been so eager to preserve themselves in inertia.
	Few therefore have attached so great an importance to authority.
	Every detail of our life has been fixed for us by Shastra and custom, every detail of our thought by
	Scripture and its commentators, — but much oftener by the commentators than by Scripture.
	Only in one field, that of individual spiritual experience, have we cherished the ancient freedom and
	originality out of which our past greatness sprang; it is from some new movement in this inexhaustible source that
	every fresh impulse and rejuvenated strength has arisen.
	Otherwise we should long ago have been in the grave where dead nations lie, with Greece and Rome of the
	Caesars, with Esarhaddon and the Chosroes.
	You will often hear it said that it was the forms of Hinduism which have given us so much national
	vitality.
	I think rather it was its spirit.
	I am inclined to give more credit for the secular miracle of our national survival to Shankara, Ramanuja,
	Nanak and Kabir, Guru Govind, Chaitanya, Ramdas and Tukaram than to Raghunandan and the Pandits of Nadiya and
	Bhatpara.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 39</p>
<p class="P">The result of this well-meaning bondage has been an increasing impoverishment of the Indian
	intellect, once the most gigantic and original in the world.
	Hence a certain incapacity, atrophy, impotence have marked our later activities even at their
	best.
	The most striking instance is our continued helplessness in the face of the new conditions and new
	knowledge imposed on us by recent European contact.
	We have tried to assimilate, we have tried to reject, we have tried to select; but we have not been able
	to do any of these things successfully.
	Successful assimilation depends on mastery; but we have not mastered European conditions and knowledge,
	rather we have been seized, subjected and enslaved by them.
	Successful rejection is possible only if we have intelligent possession of that which we wish to
	keep.
	Our rejection too must be an intelligent rejection; we must reject because we have understood, not
	because we have failed to understand.
	But our Hinduism, our old culture are precisely the possessions we have cherished with the least
	intelligence; throughout the whole range of our life we do things without knowing why we do them, we believe things
	without knowing why we believe them, we assert things without knowing what right we have to assert them, — or, at
	most, it is because some book or some Brahmin enjoins it, because Shankara thinks it, or because someone has so
	interpreted something that he asserts to be a fundamental Scripture of our religion.
	Nothing is our own, nothing native to our intelligence, all is derived.
	As little have we understood the new knowledge; we have only understood what the Europeans want us to
	think about themselves and their modern civilisation.
	Our English culture — if culture it can be called — has increased tenfold the evil of our dependence
	instead of remedying it.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 40</p>
<p class="P">More even than the other two processes successful selection requires the independent play of
	intellect.
	If we merely receive new ideas and institutions in the light in which they are presented to us, we shall,
	instead of selecting, imitate — blindly, foolishly and inappropriately.
	If we receive them in the light given by our previous knowledge, which was on so many points nil, we
	shall as blindly and foolishly reject.
	Selection demands that we should see things not as the foreigner sees them or as the orthodox Pandit sees
	them, but as they are in themselves.
	But we have selected at random, we have rejected at random, we have not known how to assimilate or
	choose.
	In the upshot we have merely suffered the European impact, overborne at points, crassly resisting at
	others, and, altogether, miserable, enslaved by our environments, able neither to perish nor to survive.
	We preserve indeed a certain ingenuity and subtlety; we can imitate with an appearance of brightness; we
	can play plausibly, even brilliantly with the minutiae of a subject; but we fail to think usefully, we fail to
	master the life and heart of things.
	Yet it is only by mastering the life and heart of things that we can hope, as a nation, to
	survive.
</p>
<p class="P">How shall we recover our lost intellectual freedom and elasticity?
	By reversing, for a time at least, the process by which we lost it, by liberating our minds in all
	subjects from the thraldom to authority.
	That is not what reformers and the Anglicised require of us.
	They ask us, indeed, to abandon authority, to revolt against custom and superstition, to have free and
	enlightened minds.
	But they mean by these sounding recommendations that we should renounce the authority of Sayana for the
	authority of Max Muller, the Monism of Shankara for the Monism of Haeckel, the written Shastra for the unwritten law
	of European social opinion, the dogmatism of Brahmin Pandits for the dogmatism of European scientists, thinkers and
	scholars.
	Such a foolish exchange of servitude can receive the assent of no self-respecting mind.
	Let us break our chains, venerable as they are, but let it be in order to be free, — in the name of
	truth, not in the name of Europe.
	It would be a poor bargain to exchange our old Indian illuminations, however dark they may have grown to
	us, for a derivative European enlightenment or replace the superstitions of popular Hinduism by the superstitions of
	materialistic Science.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 41</p>
<p class="P">Our first necessity, if India is to survive and do her appointed work in the world, is that the
	youth of India should learn to think, — to think on all subjects, to think independently, fruitfully, going to the
	heart of things, not stopped by their surface, free of prejudgments, shearing sophism and prejudice asunder as with
	a sharp sword, smiting down obscurantism of all kinds as with the mace of Bhima.
	Let our brains<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="26" href="#">1</a> no longer, like European infants, be swathed
	with swaddling clothes; let them<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="27" href="#">2</a> recover the free and unbound motion of
	the gods; let them<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="28" href="#">3</a> have not only the minuteness but the wide mastery
	and sovereignty natural to the intellect of Bharata and easily recoverable by it if it once accustoms itself to feel
	its own power and be convinced of its own worth.
	If it cannot entirely shake off past shackles, let it at least arise like the infant Krishna bound to the
	wain, and move forward dragging with it wain and all and shattering in its progress the twin trees, the twin
	obstacles to self-fulfilment, blind mediaeval prejudice and arrogant modern dogmatism.
	The old fixed foundations have been broken up, we are tossing in the waters of a great upheaval and
	change.
	It is no use clinging to the old ice-floes of the past, they will soon melt and leave their refugees
	struggling in perilous waters.
	It is no use landing ourselves in the infirm bog, neither sea nor good dry land, of a secondhand
	Europeanism.
	We shall only die there a miserable and unclean death.
	No, we must learn to swim and use that power to reach the good vessel of unchanging truth; we must land
	again on the eternal rock of ages.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 42</p>
<p class="P">Let us not, either, select at random, make a nameless hotchpotch and then triumphantly call it
	the assimilation of East and West.
	We must begin by accepting nothing on trust from any source whatsoever, by questioning everything and
	forming our own conclusions.
	We need not fear that we shall by that process cease to be Indians or fall into the danger of abandoning
	Hinduism.
	India can never cease to be India or Hinduism to be Hinduism, if we really think for
	ourselves.
	It is only if we allow Europe to think for us that India is in danger of becoming an ill-executed and
	foolish copy of Europe.
	We must not begin by becoming partisans but know before we take our line.
	Our first business as original thinkers will be to accept nothing, to question everything.
	That means to get rid of all unexamined opinions old or new, all mere habitual sanskaras in the mind, to
	have no preconceived judgments.
	Anityah sarvasanskarah, said the Buddha.
	I do not know that I quite agree.
	There are certain sanskaras that seem to me as eternal as things can be.
	What is the Atman itself but an eternal and fundamental way of looking at things, the essentiality of all
	being in itself unknowable, neti, neti.
	Therefore the later Buddhists declared that the Atman itself did not exist and arrived at ultimate
	nothingness, a barren and foolish conclusion, since Nothingness itself is only a sanskara.
	Nevertheless it is certain that the great mass of our habitual conceptions are not only temporary, but
	imperfect and misleading.
	We must escape from these imperfections and take our stand on that which is true and lasting.
	But in order to find out what in our conceptions is true and lasting, we must question all alike
	rigorously and impartially.
	The necessity of such a process not for India, but for all humanity has been recognised by leading
	European thinkers.
	It was what Carlyle meant when he spoke of swallowing all formulas.
	It was the process by which Goethe helped to reinvigorate European thinking.
	But in Europe the stream is running dry before it has reached its sea.
	Europe has for some time ceased to produce original thinkers, though it still produces original
	mechanicians.
	Science preserves her freedom of inquiry in details, in the mint and anise and cummin of the world's
	processes, but, bound hand and foot in the formulas of the past, she is growing helpless for great ideas and sound
	generalisations.
	She sits contented with her treasuries; she has combed all the pebbles on the seashore and examined the
	shoreward gulfs and bays; of the oceans beyond and their undiscovered continents she cries scornfully “They are a
	dream; there is nothing there but mists mistaken for land or a waste of the same waters that we have already here
	examined.”
	Europe is becoming stereotyped and unprogressive; she is fruitful only of new and ever multiplying
	luxuries and of feverish, fiery and ineffective changes in her political and social machinery.
	China, Japan and the Mussulman States are sliding into a blind European imitativeness.
	In India alone there is self-contained, dormant, the energy and the invincible spiritual individuality
	which can yet arise and break her own and the world's fetters.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="P">It is true that original thinking makes for original acting, and therefore a caution is
	necessary.
	We must be careful that our thinking is not only original but thorough before we even initiate
	action.
	To run away with an isolated original idea, or charmed with its newness and vigour, to ride it into the
	field of action is to make of ourselves cranks and eccentrics.
	This world, this society, these nations and their civilisations are not simple existences, but complex
	and intricate, the result of a great organic growth in many centuries, sometimes in many millenniums.
	We should not deal with them after snatching at a few hurried generalisations or in the gust and fury of
	a stiff fanaticism.
	We must first be sure that our new thought is wide and strong-winged enough, our thoughts large enough,
	our natures mighty enough to deal with those vastnesses.
	We must be careful, too, to comprehend what we destroy.
	And destroy we must not unless we have a greater and more perfect thing to put in the place even of a
	crumbling and mouldering antiquity.
	To tear down Hindu society in the spirit of the social reformers or European society in the spirit of the
	philosophical or unphilosophical Anarchists would be to destroy order and substitute a licentious
	confusion.
	If we carefully remember these cautions, there is no harm in original thinking even of the boldest and
	most merciless novelty.
	I may, for example, attack unsparingly the prevailing system of justice and punishment as extraordinarily
	senseless and evil, even if I have no new system ready-made to put in as its successor; but I must have no wish to
	destroy it, senseless and evil though it be, until our new system is ready.
	For it fills a place the vacancy of which the Spirit that uplifts and supports our human welfare, would
	greatly abhor.
	I may expose, too, the weaknesses and narrownesses of an existing form of religion, even if I have no new
	and better form to preach of my own, but I must not so rage against those weaknesses as to destroy all religious
	faith and I should remember before the end of my criticism that even a bad religion is better than no religion, —
	that it is wiser to worship energy in my surroundings with the African savage than to be dead to all faith and all
	spirituality like the drunkards of a little knowledge — for even in that animal and unintelligent worship there is a
	spark of the divine fire which keeps humanity living, while the cultured imperial Roman or the luxurious modern
	wealth-gatherer and body worshipper drags his kind into a straight</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 44</p>
<p class="P">and well built road which is so broad only to
	lead more easily to a mighty perdition — <em>na ched ibavedin mahati vinashtih</em>.
	Otherwise there is no harm in spreading dissatisfaction with fetish worship or refusing praise to an
	ancient and cruel folly.
	We need not be troubled if our thinking is condemned as too radical or even as reckless and
	revolutionary, — for the success of revolutionary thought always means that Nature has need of one of her
	cataclysms; even otherwise, she will make of it whatever modified use is best for our present humanity.
	In thought as in deeds, to the thinking we have a right, the result belongs to the wise and active Power
	of God that stands over us and in us originating, cherishing, indefatigably dissolving and remoulding man and spirit
	in the progressive harmonies of His universe.
	Let us only strive that our light should be clear, diffused and steady, not either darkness or a narrow
	glare and merely violent lustre.
	And if we cannot compass that ideal, still it is better to think than to cease from thinking.
	For even out of darkness the day is born and lightning has its uses!

<p class="P">
	We have had recently in India a great abundance of speculations on the real causes of that gradual decline and final
	arrest which Indian civilisation no less than European suffered during the Middle Ages.
	The arrest was neither so sudden as in Europe nor so complete; but its effect on our nation, like the undermining
	activity of a slow poison, was all the more profoundly destructive, pervasive, hard to remedy, difficult to expel.
	At a certain period we entered into a decline, splendid at first like a long and gorgeous sunset, afterwards more
	and more sombre, till the darkness closed in, and if our sky was strewn with stars of a great number and brilliance,
	it was only a vast decay, confusion and inertia that they lighted and emphasised with their rays.
	We have, most of us, our chosen explanation of this dolorous phenomenon.
	The patriot attributes our decline to the ravages of foreign invasion and the benumbing influences of foreign rule;
	the disciple of European materialism finds out the enemy, the evil, the fount and origin of all our ills, in our
	religion and its time-honoured social self-expression.
	Such explanations, like most human thoughts, have their bright side of truth as well as their obscure side of error;
	but they are not, in any case, the result of impartial thinking.
	Man may be, as he has been defined, a reasoning animal, but it is necessary to add that he is, for the most part, a
	very badly-reasoning animal.
	He does not ordinarily think for the sake of finding out the truth, but much more for the satisfaction of his mental
	preferences and emotional tendencies; his conclusions spring from his preferences, prejudices and passions; and his
	reasoning and logic paraded to justify them are only a specious process or a formal mask for his covert approach to
	an upshot previously necessitated by his heart or by his temperament.
	When we are awakened from our modern illusions, as we have been awakened from our mediaeval superstitions, we shall
	find that the intellectual conclusions of the rationalist for all their [ . . . ] pomp and profuse apparatus of
	scrupulous enquiry were as much dogmas as those former dicta of Pope and theologian, which confessed without shame
	their simple basis in the negation of reason.
	Much more do all those current opinions demand scrutiny and modification, which express our personal view of things
	and rest patently on a partial and partisan view or have been justified by preferential selection of the few data
	that suited our foregone and desired conclusion.
	It is always best, therefore, to scrutinise very narrowly those bare, trenchant explanations which so easily satisfy
	the pugnacious animal in our intellects; when we have admitted that small part of the truth on which they seize, we
	should always look for the large part which they have missed.
	Especially is it right, when there are subjective movements and causes of a considerable extent and complexity
	behind the phenomena we have to observe, to distrust facile, simple and rapid solutions.

	The Balance of Justice
</h1>
<p class="P">
	The European Court of Justice is a curious and instructive institution.
	Europe, even while vaunting a monopoly of civilisation, cherishes and preens herself in some remarkable relics of
	barbarism.
	In mediaeval times, with the scientific thoroughness and efficiency which she shares with the Mongolian, she
	organised torture as the most reliable source of evidence and the ordeal of battle as the surest guide to judicial
	truth.
	Both ideas were characteristically European.
	A later age may seem to have got rid of these luminous methods, but it is not so in reality.
	In place of the rack the French have invented the investigating judge and the Americans some remarkable processes,
	which I think they call questioning (the old name for torture) in the first, second and up to the fifth degree if
	not to higher stages of excellence.
	The torture is sometimes of the mind not of the body; it is less intense, more lingering, but it leads to the same
	result in the end.
	When the tortured wretch, after protecting with lies for as long as may be his guilt or his innocence, escapes from
	his furious and pitiless persecutor by a true or false confession, preferring jail or the gallows to this
	prolongation of tense misery, the French call it delicately “entering into the way of avowals”.
	The Holy Office in Seville could not have invented a more Christian and gentlemanly euphemism.
	The American system, is in the fifth degree, I think, to keep the miserable accused fasting and sleepless and ply
	him with a ceaseless assault of torturing questions and suggestions until the brain reels, the body sinks, the heart
	is sick and hopeless and the man is ready to say anything his torturers believe or want to be the truth.
	It is a true Inquisition; the mediaeval name fits these modern refinements.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 47</p>
<p class="P">
	The English people have often been accused as a brutal or a stupid nation; but they have a rugged humanity when
	their interests are not touched and enjoy glimpses of a rough common sense.
	They have besides an honourable love of publicity and do not like, for themselves at least, secret police methods.
	They have rejected the investigating judge and torture in the fifth degree.
	But their courts resemble the European.
	Under a civilised disguise these Courts are really the mediaeval ordeal by battle; only in place of the swords and
	lances of military combatants we have the tongues and technicalities of lawyers and the mutually tilting
	imaginations of witnesses.
	The victory is to the skilfullest liar and the most plausible workman in falsehoods and insincerities.
	It is largely an elaborate pitch and toss, an exhilarating gamble, a very Monte Carlo of surprising chances.
	But there is skill in it, too; it satisfies the intellect as well as the sensations.
	One should rather call it a game of human Bridge which admirably combines luck and skill, or consider it as an
	intellectual gladiatorial show.
	In big cases the stake is worthy of the play and the excitement, a man's property or his life.
	But woe to the beaten!
	In a criminal case, the tortures of the jail or the terrifying drop from the gallows are in prospect, and it is
	rather the hardihood of guilt than the trembling consciousness of innocence that shall best help him.
	Woe to him if he is innocent!
	As he stands there, — for to add to the pleasurableness of his condition, the physical ache of hours of standing is
	considerately added to the cruel strain on his emotions, — he looks eagerly not to the truth or falsehood of the
	evidence for or against him, but to the skill with which this or that counsel handles the web of skilfully mixed
	truth and lies and the impression he is making on the judge or the jury.
	A true witness breaking down under a confusing cross-examination or a false witness mended by a judicious
	reexamination may be of much better service to him than the Truth, which, our Scriptures tell us, shall prevail and
	not falsehood, — eventually perhaps and in the things of the truth, but not in the things of falsehood, not in a
	court of Justice, not in the witness box.
	There the last thing the innocent man against whom circumstances have turned, dare tell is the truth; it would
	either damn him completely by fatally helping the prosecution or it is so simple and innocent as to convince the
	infallible human reason of its pitiful falsity.
	The truth!
	Has not the Law expressly built up a hedge of technicalities to keep out the truth?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 48</p>
<p class="P">As one looks on, one begins to understand the passion of the Roman poet's eulogy of the defence counsel,
	<em>praesidium maestis reis</em>, the bulwark of the sorrowful accused. For in this strange civilised gambling with
	human dice where it is so often impossible to be certain about guilt or innocence, one's sympathies naturally go to
	the sufferer, the scapegoat of a callous society, who may be moving to a long period of torturing and unmerited
	slavery or an undeserved death on the gallows. But if one could eliminate this element of human pity, it would be a
	real intellectual pleasure to watch the queer barbarous battle, appraise the methods of the chief players, admire,
	in whatever climes, the elusiveness and fine casualness of Indian perjury or the robust manly cheery downrightness
	of Saxon cross-swearing. If the Courts convince us of our common humanity by making all men liars, they yet preserve
	a relishable unlikeness in likeness. And I think that even theology or metaphysics does not give such admirable
	chances for subtlety as the Law, nor even Asiatic Research or ethnology favour so much the growth of that admirable
	scientific faculty which deduces a whole animal out of some other animal's bone. If the thing proved is generally
	wrong, it is always ingenious; and after all in all these five sciences, or are they not rather arts?—it is not the
	thing that is true but the thing that is desired which must be established. This is perhaps why the Europeans think
	the system civilised, but as a semi-civilised Oriental, one would prefer less room for subtlety and more for truth.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 49</p>
<p class="P">
	On the whole, if anyone were to complain that modern civilisation eliminates danger and excitement out of human
	life, we could well answer the morbid grumbler, “Come into our Courts and see!”
	Still, praise must be given where praise is due, and let the English system once more be lauded for not normally
	exposing the accused to the torture of savage pursuit by a prosecuting judge or the singular revival in modern dress
	of the ancient “question” by the American police.
	Where political or other passions are not roused and bribery does not enter, the poor muddled magistrate does his
	honest best, and where there is a system of trial by jury, the blunders, whims and passions of twelve men may decide
	your fate less insanely than the caprices of a Kazi, — though even that is hardly certain.
	At any rate, if the dice are apt to be loaded, it is, with the exceptions noted, not on one but on both sides of the
	gamble.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="social-reform">
	Social Reform
</h1>
<p class="P">Reform is not an excellent thing in itself as many Europeanised intellects imagine;
	neither is it always safe and good to stand unmoved in the ancient paths as the orthodox obstinately
	believe.
	Reform is sometimes the first step to the abyss, but immobility is the most perfect way to stagnate and
	to putrefy.
	Neither is moderation always the wisest counsel: the mean is not always golden.
	It is often an euphemism for purblindness, for a tepid indifference or for a cowardly
	inefficiency.
	Men call themselves moderates, conservatives or extremists and manage their conduct and opinions in
	accordance with a formula.
	We like to think by systems and parties and forget that truth is the only standard.
	Systems are merely convenient cases for keeping arranged knowledge, parties a useful machinery for
	combined action; but we make of them an excuse for avoiding the trouble of thought.
</p>
<p class="P">One is astonished at the position of the orthodox.
	They labour to deify everything that exists.
	Hindu society has certain arrangements and habits which are merely customary.
	There is no proof that they existed in ancient times nor any reason why they should last into the
	future.
	It has other arrangements and habits for which textual authority can be quoted, but it is oftener the
	text of the modern Smritikaras than of Parasara and Manu.
	Our authority for them goes back to the last five hundred years.
	I do not understand the logic which argues that because a thing has lasted for five hundred years it must
	be perpetuated through the aeons.
	Neither antiquity nor modernity can be the test of truth or the test of usefulness.
	All the Rishis do not belong to the past; the Avatars still come; revelation still continues.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 51</p>
<p class="P">Some claim that we must at any rate adhere to Manu and the Puranas, whether because they are
	sacred or because they are national.
	Well, but, if they are sacred, you must keep to the whole and not cherish isolated texts while
	disregarding the body of your authority.
	You cannot pick and choose; you cannot say “This is sacred and I will keep to it, that is less sacred and
	I will leave it alone.”
	When you so treat your sacred authority, you are proving that to you it has no sacredness.
	You are juggling with truth; for you are pretending to consult Manu when you are really consulting your
	own opinions, preferences or interests.
	To recreate Manu entire in modern society is to ask Ganges to flow back to the Himalayas.
	Manu is no doubt national, but so is the animal sacrifice and the burnt offering.
	Because a thing is national of the past, it need not follow that it must be national of the
	future.
	It is stupid not to recognise altered conditions.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 52</p>
<p class="P">We have similar apologies for the unintelligent preservation of mere customs; but, various as
	are the lines of defence, I do not know any that is imperiously conclusive.
	Custom is <em>shishtachar</em>, decorum, that which all well-bred and respectable
	people observe.
	But so were the customs of the far past that have been discontinued and, if now revived, would be
	severely discountenanced and, in many cases, penalised; so too are the customs of the future that are now being
	resisted or discouraged, — even, I am prepared to believe, the future no less than the past prepares for us new
	modes of living which in the present would not escape the censure of the law.
	It is the <em>achar</em> that makes the <em>shishta</em>, not the
	<em>shishta</em> who makes the <em>achar</em>.
	The <em>achar</em> is made by the rebel, the innovator, the man who is regarded in his
	own time as eccentric, disreputable or immoral, as was Sri Krishna by Bhurisrava<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="29" href="#">1</a> because he upset the old ways and the old standards.
	Custom may be better defended as ancestral and therefore cherishable.
	But if our ancestors had persistently held that view, our so cherished customs would never have come into
	being.
	Or, more rationally, custom must be preserved because its long utility in the past argues a sovereign
	virtue for the preservation of society.
	But to all things there is a date and a limit.
	All long-continued customs have been sovereignly useful in their time, even totemism and
	polyandry.
	We must not ignore the usefulness of the past, but we seek in preference a present and a future utility.
	
</p>
<p class="P">Custom and Law may then be altered.
	For each age its shastra.
	But we cannot argue straight off that it must be altered, or even if alteration is necessary, that it
	must be altered in a given direction.
	One is repelled by the ignorant enthusiasm of social reformers.
	Their minds are usually a strange jumble of ill-digested European notions.
	Very few of them know anything about Europe, and even those who have visited it know it
	badly.
	But they will not allow things or ideas contrary to European notions to be anything but superstitious,
	barbarous, harmful and benighted, they will not suffer what is praised and practised in Europe to be anything but
	rational and enlightened.
	They are more appreciative than Occidentals themselves of the strength, knowledge and enjoyment of
	Europe; they are blinder than the blindest and most self-sufficient Anglo-Saxon to its weakness, ignorance and
	misery.
	They are charmed by the fair front Europe presents to herself and the world; they are unwilling to
	discern any disease in the entrails, any foulness in the rear.
	For the Europeans are as careful to conceal their social as their physical bodies and shrink with more
	horror from nakedness and indecorum than from the reality of evil.
	If they see the latter in themselves, they avert their eyes, crying, “It is nothing or it is little; we
	are healthy, we are perfect, we are immortal.”
	But the face and hands cannot always be covered, and we see blotches.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="P">The social reformer repeats certain stock arguments like shibboleths.
	For these antiquities he is a fanatic or a crusader.
	Usually he does not act up to his ideas, but in all sincerity he loves them and fights for
	them.
	He pursues his nostrums as panaceas; it would be infidelity to question or examine their
	efficacy.
	His European doctors have told him that early marriage injures the physique of a nation, and that to him
	is the gospel.
	It is not convenient to remember that physical deterioration is a modern phenomenon in India and that our
	grandparents were strong, vigorous and beautiful.
	He hastens to abolish the already disappearing nautchgirl, but it does not seem to concern him that the
	prostitute multiplies.
	Possibly some may think it a gain that the European form of the malady is replacing the
	Indian!
	He tends towards shattering our cooperative system of society and does not see that Europe is striding
	Titanically towards Socialism.
</p>
<p class="P">Orthodox and reformer alike lose themselves in details; but it is principles that determine
	details.
	Almost every point that the social reformers raise could be settled one way or the other without
	effecting the permanent good of society.
	It is pitiful to see men labouring the point of marriage between subcastes and triumphing over an
	isolated instance.
	Whether the spirit as well as the body of caste should remain, is the modern question.
	Let Hindus remember that caste as it stands is merely <em>jat</em>, the trade guild
	sanctified but no longer working, it is not the eternal religion, it is not <em>chaturvarnya</em>.
	I do not care whether widows marry or remain single; but it is of infinite importance to consider how
	women shall be legally and socially related to man, as his inferior, equal or superior; for even the relation of
	superiority is no more impossible in the future than it was in the far-distant past.
	And the most important question of all is whether society shall be competitive or cooperative,
	individualistic or communistic.
	That we should talk so little about these things and be stormy over insignificant details, shows
	painfully the impoverishment of the average Indian intellect.
	If these greater things are decided, as they must be, the smaller will arrange themselves.
</span></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 54</p>
<p class="P">There are standards that are universal and there are standards that are particular.
	At the present moment all societies are in need of reform, the Parsi, Mahomedan and Christian not a whit
	less than the Hindu which alone seems to feel the need of radical reformation.
	In the changes of the future the Hindu society must take the lead towards the establishment of a new
	universal standard.
	Yet being Hindus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="30" href="#">2</a> we must seek it through that which is
	particular to ourselves.
	We have one standard that is at once universal and particular, the eternal religion, which is the basis,
	permanent and always inherent in India, of the shifting, mutable and multiform thing we call Hinduism.
	Sticking fast where you are like a limpet is not the dharma, neither is leaping without looking the
	dharma.
	The eternal religion is to realise God in our inner life and our outer existence, in society not less
	than in the individual.
	<em>Esha dharmah sanatanah</em>.
	God is not antiquity nor novelty: He is not the Manava Dharmashastra, nor Vidyaranya, nor Raghunandan;
	neither is He an European.
	God who is essentially Sachchidananda, is in manifestation Satyam, Prema, Shakti<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="31" href="#">3</a>, — Truth, Strength and Love.
	Whatever is consistent with the truth and principle of things, whatever increases love among men,
	whatever makes for the strength of the individual, the nation and the race, is divine, it is the law of Vaivaswata
	Manu, it is the <em>sanatana dharma</em> and the Hindu shastra.
	Only, God is the triple harmony, He is not one-sided.
	Our love must not make us weak, blind or unwise; our strength must not make us hard and furious; our
	principles<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="32" href="#">4</a> must not make us fanatical or sentimental.
	Let us think calmly, patiently, impartially; let us love wholly and intensely but wisely; let us act with
	strength, nobility and force.
	If even then we make mistakes, yet God makes none.
	We decide and act; He determines the fruit, and whatever He determines is good.
</p>
<p class="P">He is already determining it.
	Men have long been troubling themselves about social reform and blameless orthodoxy, and orthodoxy has
	crumbled without social reform being effected.
	But all the time God has been going about India getting His work done in spite of the
	talking.
	Unknown to men the social revolution prepares itself, and it is not in the direction they think, for it
	embraces the world, not India only.
	Whether we like it or not, He will sweep out the refuse of the Indian past and the European
	present.
	But the broom is not always sufficient; sometimes He uses the sword in preference.
	It seems probable that it will be used, for the world does not mend itself quickly, and therefore it will
	have violently to be mended.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 55</p>
<p class="P">But this is a general principle; how shall we determine the principles that are particular to
	the nature of the community and the nature of the Age?
	There is such a thing as yugadharma, the right institutions and modes of action for the age in which we
	live.
	For action depends indeed on the force of knowledge or will that is to be used, but it depends, too, on
	the time, the place and the vessel.
	Institutions that are right in one age are not right in another.
	Replacing social system by social system, religion by religion, civilisation by civilisation God is
	perpetually leading man onwards to loftier and more embracing manifestations of our human
	perfectibility.
	When in His cosmic circling movement He establishes some stable worldwide harmony, that is man's Satya
	Yuga.
	When harmony falters, is maintained with difficulty, not in the nature of men, but by an accepted force
	or political instrument, that is his Treta.
	When the faltering becomes stumbling and the harmony has to be maintained at every step by a careful and
	laborious regulation, that is his Dwapara.
	When there is disintegration, and all descends in collapse and ruin, nothing can stay farther the
	cataclysm that is his Kali.
	This is the natural law of progress of all human ideas and institutions.
	It applies always in the mass, continually though less perfectly in the detail.
	One may almost say that each human religion, society, civilisation has its four Ages.
	For this movement is not only the most natural, but the most salutary.
	It is not a justification of pessimism nor a gospel of dumb fate and sorrowful annihilation.
	It is not, as we too often think in our attachment to the form, a melancholy law of decline and the
	vanity of all human achievements.
	If each Satya has its Kali, equally does each Kali prepare its Satya.
	That destruction was necessary for this creation, and the new harmony, when it is perfected, will be
	better than the old.
	But there is the weakness, there is the half success turning to failure, there is the discouragement,
	there is the loss of energy and faith which clouds our periods of disintegration, the apparent war, violence,
	ragging, tumult and trample to and fro which attends our periods of gradual creation and
	half-perfection.
	Therefore men cry out dismally and lament that all is perishing.
	But if they trusted in God's Love and Wisdom, not preferring to it their conservative and narrow notions,
	they would rather cry out that all is being reborn.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 56</p>
<p class="P">So much depends on Time and God's immediate purpose that it is more important to seek out His
	purpose than to attach ourselves to our own nostrums.
	The Kala Purusha, Zeitgeist and Death Spirit, has risen to his dreadful work — lokakshayakritpravriddhas
	— increasing to destroy a world, — and who shall stay the terror and mightiness and irresistibility of
	Him?
	But He is not only destroying the world that was, He is creating the world that shall be; it is therefore
	more profitable for us to discover and help what He is building than to lament and hug in our arms what He is
	destroying.
	But it is not easy to discover His drift, and we often admire too much temporary erections which are
	merely tents for the warriors in this Kurukshetra and take them for the permanent buildings of the
	future.
</p>
<p class="P">The Pandits are therefore right when they make a difference between the practice of the Satya
	and the practice of the Kali.
	But in their application of this knowledge, they do not seem to me to be always wise or
	learned.
	They forget or do not know that Kali is the age for a destruction and rebirth, not for a desperate
	clinging to the old that can no longer be saved.
	They entrench themselves in the system of Kalivarjya, but forget that it is not the weaknesses but the
	strengths of the old harmony that are being subjected to varjanam, abandonment.
	That which is saved is merely a temporary platform which we have erected on the banks of the sea of
	change awaiting a more stable habitation; and it too must one day break down under the crash of the waves, must
	disappear into the engulfing waters.
	Has the time arrived for that destruction?
	We think that it has.
	Listen to the crash of those waters, — more formidable than the noise of assault, mark that slow, sullen,
	remorseless sapping, — watch pile after pile of our patched incoherent ramshackle structure corroding, creaking,
	shaking with the blows, breaking, sinking silently or with a splash, suddenly or little by little into the yeast of
	those billows.
	Has the time arrived for a new construction?
	We say it has.
	Mark the activity, eagerness and hurrying to and fro of mankind, the rapid prospecting, seeking, digging,
	founding — see the Avatars and great vibhutis coming, arising thickly, treading each close behind the
	other.
	Are not these the signs and do they not tell us that the great Avatar of all arrives to establish the
	first Satya Yuga of the Kali?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 57</p>
<p class="P">For in the Kali too, say the secret and ancient traditions of the Yogins, there is a perpetual
	minor repetition of Satya-Treta-Dwapara-Kali subcycles, the subSatya a temporary and imperfect harmony which in the
	subTreta and subDwapara breaks down and disappears in the subKali.
	The process then begins over again [............................................] for each new temporary
	harmony is fairer and more perfect than its preceding harmony, each new temporary collapse more resounding and
	terrible than its anterior dissolution.
	Already ended are the first five thousand years of the Kali which were necessary to prepare for final
	destruction the relics of the ancient Satya.
	Weakness and violence, error and ignorance and oblivion rushing with an increasing speed and rhythm over
	the whole earth have done for us that work.
	The morning of the first Kali-Satya is ready to break, the first few streaks dimly visible.
	So runs the not incredible tradition.
</p>
<p class="P">Yes. A new harmony, but not the scrannel pipes of European materialism, not an Occidental
	foundation upon half truths and whole falsehoods.
	When there is destruction it is the form that perishes, not the spirit — for the world and its ways are
	forms of one Truth which appears in this material world in ever new bodies and constantly varied apparel — the
	inward Eternal taking the joy of outward Mutability.
	The truth of the old Satya that is dead was not different from the Truth of the new Satya that is to be
	born, for it is Truth that restores itself always and persists.
	In India, the chosen land, it is preserved; in the soul of India it sleeps, expectant of that soul's
	awakening, the soul of India leonine, luminous, locked in the closed petals of the ancient lotus of strength and
	wisdom, not in her weak, sordid, transient and miserable externals.
	India alone can build the future of mankind; in India alone can the effective Avatar appear to the
	nations.
	And until He appears, it is for India to gather herself up out of her dust and degradation, — symbol of
	the shattered Satyayuga — commune with her soul by Yoga and to know her past and her future.
	I have not here speculated on what we should build, what we should break, nor shall I now define my
	detailed opinions — but whatever it be, we must do it in the light and in the spirit of that triple principle of the
	divine nature; we must act in the reflection of God's Love, Strength and Wisdom.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 58</p>
<p class="P">We are Hindus seeking to re-Hinduise society, not to Europeanise it.
	But what is Hinduism?
	Or what is its social principle?
	 One thing at least is certain about Hinduism religious or social, that its whole outlook is Godward, its
	whole search and business is the discovery of God and our fulfilment in God.
	But God is everywhere and universal.
	Where did Hinduism seek Him?
	Ancient or preBuddhistic Hinduism sought him both in the world and outside it; it took its stand on the
	strength and beauty and joy of the Veda, unlike modern or postBuddhistic Hinduism which is oppressed with Buddha's
	sense of universal sorrow and Shankara's sense of universal illusion, — Shankara who was the better able to destroy
	Buddhism because he was himself half a Buddhist.
	Ancient Hinduism aimed socially at our fulfilment in God in life, modern Hinduism at the escape from life
	to God.
	The more modern ideal is fruitful of a noble and ascetic spirituality, but has a chilling and hostile
	effect on social soundness and development, social life under its shadow stagnates for want of belief and delight,
	sraddha and ananda.
	If we are to make our society perfect and the nation is to live again, then we must revert to the earlier
	and fuller truth.
	We must not make life a waiting for renunciation, but renunciation a preparation for life; instead of
	running from God in the town to God in the forest, we must rather plunge into the mountain solitude in our own souls
	for knowledge and joy and spiritual energy to sustain any part that may be given to us by the master of the
	Lila.
	If we get that strength, any society we build up must be full of the instinct of immortal life and move
	inevitably towards perfection.
	As to the precise way in which society will be reconstructed, we have hardly yet knowledge enough to
	solve the problem.
	We ought to know before we act, but we are rather eager to act violently in the light of any dim ray of
	knowledge that may surprise our unreflecting intellects, and although God often uses our haste for great and
	beneficial purposes, yet that way of doing things is not the best either for a man or a nation.
	One thing seems to me clear that the future will deny that principle of individual selfishness and
	collective self-interest on which European society has hitherto been based and our renovated systems will be based
	on the renunciation of individual selfishness and the organisation of brotherhood, — principles common to
	Christianity, Mahomedanism and Hinduism.

	Hinduism and the Mission of India
</h1>
<p class="P">
	[.....] [That] which is permanent in the Hindu religion, must form the basis on which the world will increasingly
	take its stand in dealing with spiritual experience and religious truth.
	Hinduism, in my sense of the word, is not modern Brahmanism.
	Modern Brahmanism developed into existence at a definite period in history.
	It is now developing out of existence; its mission is done, its capacities exhausted, the Truth which, like other
	religions, it defended, honoured, preserved, cherished, misused and disfigured, is about to take to itself new forms
	and dispense with all other screens or defender than its own immortal beauty, grandeur, truth and effectiveness.
	It is this unchanging undying Truth which has to be discovered and placed in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="33" href="#">1</a> its native light before humanity.
	Tad etat satyam.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 60</p>
<p class="P">
	There are many defenders and discoverers of truth now active among us.
	They are all busy defending, modifying, attacking, sapping or bolstering current Hinduism.
	I am not eager to disparage but neither do I find myself satisfied with any of them.
	If I were, there would be no need for any speculation of my own.
	There are the orthodox who are busy recovering and applying old texts or any interpretations, new or old, of these
	texts, which will support the existing order, — and ignoring all that go against it.
	Their learning is praiseworthy and useful; it brings to notice many great and helpful things which were in danger of
	being misprized, lost or flung away as worthless; but they do not seem to me to go to the heart of the matter.
	There are the heterodox who are busy giving new interpretations to old texts and institutions in order to get rid of
	all such features as the modern world finds it hard to assimilate.
	Their brainwork can hardly be too highly praised; it is bringing to light or to a half light many luminous realities
	and possibilities which, if they cannot all be accepted, yet invigorate and sharpen the habit of original thinking
	and help to remove that blind adherence to traditions which is truth's greatest obstacle.
	Still they too do not seem to me to have the right grasp and discernment.
	Then there are the ascetics mystical or rationalistic who call men to disgust with the world and point to the
	temple, the monastery or the mountaintop as the best, if not the only place for finding God, and most of whom, in
	order to honour the Maker slight and denounce His works.
	Their position and temperament is so lofty and noble and their solvent force on the gross impurities of a
	materialised humanity has been so invaluable that it is with some reluctance one finds oneself obliged to put them
	on one side and pass onward.
	But it seems to me that we must pass onward if we would know and possess God in His entirety and not merely in a
	side or aspect.
	There is a story in the Jewish Scriptures which relates that when God wished to show himself to Moses, he could
	only, owing to the spiritual imperfections of the Jewish prophet, reveal safely to him His hinder parts.
	Moses would have died if he had seen the front of God; he had not the dharanam, the soul-power to support that
	tremendous vision.
	The story well illuminates the character of materialism generally and to its aggressive modern form, European
	thought and civilisation, it applies with a quite overwhelming apposite-ness.
	But it seems to me that the average Vedantist, too, has only seen, for his part, the crown of the Lord's head and
	the average bhakta only the Kaustubh-stone over His heart or the Srivatsa mark upon it.
	On the other hand, there are those rationalists who are by no means ascetical in their views or temperament and
	their name is legion; they insist on our putting religion and God aside or keeping Him only for ornamental uses in
	spare moments, leave that, they say, and devote yourselves to practical work for mankind.
	That rationalism is necessary too if only to balance the error of the ascetics who would make of God's world a
	mistake and of its Maker an Almighty blunderer or an inscrutable eccentric or an indefinable Something inhabiting a
	chaos or a mirage.
	Nevertheless, from materialism least of all, however philanthropic or patriotic, can our future salvation be
	expected.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="P">
	Finally, there are the mystics who are not ascetics, — the Theosophists.
	From one point of view I cannot find praise warm enough to do justice to the work of Theosophy; from another I
	cannot find condemnation strong enough to denounce it.
	It has forced on the notice of an unwilling world truths to which orthodoxy is blind and of which heterodoxy is
	afraid or incredulous.
	It has shown a colossal courage in facing ridicule, trampling on prejudice and slander, persisting in faith in spite
	of disillusionment, scandal and a continual shifting of knowledge.
	They have kept the flag of a past and future science flying against enormous difficulties.
	On the other hand by bringing to the investigation of that science — not its discovery, for to the Hindu Yogin it is
	known already — the traditional European methods, the methods of the market-place and the forum, it has brought on
	the truths themselves much doubt and discredit, and by importing into them the forms, jugglery and jargon of
	European mystics, their romanticism, their unbridled imagination, their galloping impatience, their haste, bragging
	and loudness, their susceptibility to dupery, trickery, obstinate error and greedy self-deception, Theosophists have
	strengthened doubt and discredit and driven many an earnest seeker to bewilderment, to angry suspicion or to final
	renunciation of the search for truth.
	They have scattered the path of the conscientious investigators, the severe scientists of Yoga who must appear in
	the future, with the thorns and sharp flints of a well-justified incredulity and suspicion.
	I admit the truths that Theosophy seeks to unveil; but I do not think they can be reached if we fall into bondage
	even to the most inspiring table talk of Mahatmas or to the confused anathemas and vaticinations hurled from their
	platform tripods by modern Pythonesses of the type of Mrs Annie Besant, that great, capacious but bewildered and
	darkened intellect, now stumbling with a loud and confident blindness through those worlds of twilight and glamour,
	of distorted inspirations, perverted communications and misunderstood or half-understood perceptions which are so
	painfully familiar to the student and seeker.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 62</p>
<p class="P">
	If these things do not satisfy me, what then do I seek?
	I seek a light that shall be new, yet old, the oldest indeed of all lights.
	I seek an authority that accepting, illuminating and reconciling all human truth, shall yet reject and get rid of by
	explaining it all mere human error.
	I seek a text and a Shastra that is not subject to interpolation, modification and replacement, that moth and white
	ant cannot destroy, that the earth cannot bury nor Time mutilate.
	I seek an asceticism that shall give me purity and deliverance from self and from ignorance without stultifying God
	and His universe.
	I seek a scepticism that shall question everything but shall have the patience to deny nothing that may possibly be
	true.
	I seek a rationalism not proceeding on the untenable supposition that all the centuries of man's history except the
	nineteenth were centuries of folly and superstition, but bent on discovering truth instead of limiting inquiry by a
	new dogmatism, obscurantism and furious intolerance which it chooses to call common sense and enlightenment; I seek
	a materialism that shall recognise matter and use it without being its slave.
	I seek an occultism that shall bring out all its processes and proofs into the light of day, without mystery,
	without jugglery, without the old stupid call to humanity, “Be blind, O man, and see!”
	In short, I seek not science, not religion, not Theosophy, but Veda — the truth about Brahman, not only about His
	essentiality, but about His manifestation, not a lamp on the way to the forest, but a light and a guide to joy and
	action in the world, the truth which is beyond opinion, the knowledge which all thought strives after — yasmin
	vijnate sarvam vijnatam.
	I believe that Veda to be the foundation of the Sanatan Dharma; I believe it to be the concealed divinity within
	Hinduism, — but a veil has to be drawn aside, a curtain has to be lifted.
	I believe it to be knowable and discoverable.
	I believe the future of India and the world to depend on its discovery and on its application, not to the
	renunciation of life, but to life in the world and among men.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 63</p>
<p class="P">
	In these articles I shall not try to announce truth, but merely to inquire what are those things in Hinduism by
	following which we may arrive at the truth.
	I shall try to indicate some of my reasons — as far as within these limits it can be done — for my faith in my
	guides and the manner in which I think they should be followed.
	I am impelled to this labour by the necessity of turning the mind of young India to our true riches, our real source
	of power, purification and hope for the future and of safeguarding it in the course of its search both from false
	lights and from the raucous challenges and confident discouragements cast at us by the frail modern spirit of
	denial.
	I write, not for the orthodox, nor for those who have discovered a new orthodoxy, Samaj or Panth, nor for the
	unbeliever; I write for those who acknowledge reason but do not identify reason with Western materialism; who are
	sceptics but not unbelievers; who, admitting the claims of modern thought, still believe in India, her mission and
	her gospel, her immortal life and her eternal rebirth.

</h1>
<p class="P">
	As the Indian mind, emerging from its narrow mediaeval entrenchments, advances westward towards inevitable
	conquest, it must inevitably carry with it Yoga and Vedanta for its banners wherever it goes.
	Brahmajnana, Yoga and Dharma are the three essentialities of Hinduism; wherever it travels and find harbourage and
	resting place, these three must spread.
	All else may help or hinder.
	Shankara's philosophy may compel the homage of the intellectual, Sankhya attract the admiration of the analytical
	mind, Buddha capture the rationalist in search of a less material synthesis than the modern scientist's continual
	Annam Brahma Pranam Brahma, but these are only grandiose intellectualities.
	The world at large does not live by the pure intellect, concrete itself it stands by things concrete or practical,
	although, immaterial in its origin, it bases practicality upon abstractions.
	A goal of life, a practice of perfection and a rational, yet binding law of conduct, — these are man's continual
	quest, and in none of these demands is modern Science able to satisfy humanity.
	In reply to all such wants Science can<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="34" href="#">1</a> only cry, Society and again
	Society and always Society.
	But the nature of man knows that Society is not the whole of life.
	With the eye of the soul it sees that Society is only a means, not an end, a passing and changing outward
	phenomenon, not that fixed, clear and eternal inward standard and goal which we seek.
	Of Society as of all things Yajnavalkya's universal dictum stands; a man loves and serves Society for the sake of
	the Self and not for the sake of Society.
	That is his nature and whatever Rationalism may teach, to his nature he must always return.
	What Science could not provide India offers, Brahman for the eternal goal, Yoga for the means of perfection, dharma
	(swabhavaniyatam karma) for the rational yet binding law of conduct.
	Therefore, because it has something by which humanity can be satisfied and on which it can found itself, the victory
	of the Indian mind is assured.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 65</p>
<p class="P">
	But in order that the victory may not be slow and stumbling in its progress and imperfect in its fulfilment, it is
	necessary that whatever India has to offer should be stated to the West in language that the West can understand and
	through a principle of knowledge which it has made its own.
	Europe will accept nothing which is not scientific, nothing, that is to say which does not take up its stand on an
	assured, well-ordered and verifiable knowledge.
	Undoubtedly, for practical purposes the West is right; since only by establishing ourselves on such an assured
	foundation can we work with the utmost effectiveness and make the most of what we know.
	For shastra is the true basis of all perfect action and shastra means the full and careful teaching of the
	principles, relations and processes of every branch of knowledge, action or conduct with which the mind concerns
	itself.
	Indian knowledge possesses such a scientific basis, but, in these greater matters, unexpressed or expressed only in
	broad principles, compact aphorisms, implied logical connections not minutely treated in detail, fully, with a
	patient logical order and development in the way to which the occidental intellect is now accustomed and which it
	has become its second nature to demand.
	The aphoristic method has great advantages.
	It prevents the mind from getting encrusted in details and fossilising there; it leaves a wide room and great
	latitude for originality and the delicate play of individuality in the details.
	It allows a science to remain elastic and full of ever new potentialities for the discoverer.
	No doubt, it has disadvantages.
	It leaves much room for inaccuracy, for individual error, for the violences of the ill-trained and the freaks of the
	inefficient.
	For this, among other more important reasons, the Indian mind has thought it wise to give a firm and absolute
	authority to the guru and to insist that the disciple shall by precept and practice make his own all that the master
	has to teach him and so form and train his mind before it is allowed to play freely with his subject.
	In Europe the manual replaces the guru; the mind of the learner is not less rigidly bound and dominated but it is by
	the written rule and detail not by the more adaptable and flexible word of the guru.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 66</p>
<p class="P">
	Still, the age has its own demands, and it is becoming imperatively necessary that Indian knowledge should reveal in
	the Western way its scientific foundations.
	For if we do not do it ourselves, the Europeans will do it for us and do it badly, discrediting the knowledge in the
	process.
	The phenomenon of the Theosophical Society is a warning to us of a pressing urgency.
	It will never do to allow the science of Indian knowledge to be represented to the West through this strange and
	distorting medium.
	For this society of European and European-led inquirers arose from an impulse on which the Time-Spirit itself
	insists; their object, vaguely grasped at by them, was at bottom the systematic coordination, explanation and
	practice of Oriental religion and Oriental mental and spiritual discipline.
	Unfortunately, as always happens to a great effort in unfit hands, it stumbled at the outset and went into strange
	bypaths.
	It fell into the mediaeval snare of Gnostic mysticism, Masonic secrecy and Rosicrucian jargon.
	The little science it attempted has been rightly stigmatised as pseudo-science.
	A vain attempt to thrust in modern physical science into the explanation of psychical movements, — to explain for
	instance pranayam in the terms of oxygen and hydrogen!
	— to accept uncritically every experience and every random idea about an experience as it occurred to the mind and
	set it up as a revealed truth and almost a semi-divine communication, to make a hopeless amalgam and jumble of
	science, religion and philosophy all expressed in the terms of the imagination — this has been the scientific method
	of Theosophy.
	The result is that it lays its hands on truth and muddles it so badly that it comes out to the world as an untruth.
	And there now abound other misstatements of Indian truth, less elaborate but almost as wild and wide as Theosophy's.
	From this growing confusion we must deliver the future of humanity.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-claims-of-theosophy">The Claims of Theosophy</h1>
<p class="P">I wish to write in no narrow and intolerant spirit about Theosophy. There can be nothing more contemptibly
	ignorant than the vulgar prejudice which ridicules Theosophy because it concerns itself with marvels. From that
	point of view the whole world is a marvel; every operation of thought, speech or action is a miracle, a thing
	wonderful, obscure, occult and unknown. Even the sneer on the lips of the derider of occultism has to pass through a
	number of ill-understood processes before it can manifest itself on his face, yet the thing itself is the work of a
	second. That sneer is a much greater and more occult miracle than the precipitation of letters or the reading of the
	Akashic records. If Science is true, what more absurd, paradoxical and Rabelaisian miracle can there be than this,
	that a republic of small animalcules forming a mass of grey matter planned Austerlitz, wrote Hamlet or formulated
	the Vedanta philosophy? If I believed that strange dogma, I should no longer hold myself entitled to disbelieve
	anything. Materialism seems to me the most daring of occultisms, the most reckless and presumptuous exploiter of the
	principle, <em>Credo quia impossibile</em>, I believe it because it is impossible. If these minute cells can invent
	wireless telegraphy, why should it be impossible for them to precipitate letters or divine the past and the future?
	Until one can say of investigation "It is finished" and of knowledge "There is nothing beyond", no one has a right
	to set down men as charlatans because they profess to be the pioneers of a new kind of Science.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 68</p>
<p class="P">
	Neither, I hope, shall I be inclined to reject or criticise adversely because Theosophy has a foreign origin.
	There is no law of Nature by which spiritual knowledge is confined to the East or must bear the stamp of an Indian
	manufacture before it can receive the imprimatur of the All-Wise.
	He has made man in his own image everywhere, in the image of the Satyam Jnanam Anantam, the divine
	Truth-Knowledge-Infinity, and from wheresoever true knowledge comes, it must be welcomed.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless if men claim to be the pioneers of a new kind of Science, they must substantiate their claims.
	And if foreigners come to the people of India and demand to be accepted as instructors in our own special department
	of knowledge, they must prove that they have a prodigious superiority.
	Has the claim been substantiated?
	Has the superiority been proved?
</p>
<p class="P">
	What Indians see is a body which is professedly and hospitably open to all enquiry at the base but entrenches itself
	in a Papal or mystic infallibility at the top.
	To be admitted into the society it is enough to believe in the freest investigation and the brotherhood of mankind,
	but everyone who is admitted must feel, if he is honest with himself, that he is joining a body which stands for
	certain well-known dogmas, a definite and very elaborate cosmogony and philosophy and a peculiar organisation, the
	spirit, if not the open practice in which seems to be theocratic rather than liberal.
	One feels that the liberality of the outer rings is only a wisely politic device for attracting a wider circle of
	sympathisers from whom numerous converts to the inner can be recruited.
	It is the dogmas, the cosmogony, the philosophy, the theocratic organisation which the world understands by
	Theosophy and which one strengthens by adhesion to the society; free inquiry and the brotherhood of man benefit to a
	very slight degree.
</p>
<p class="P">
	One sees also a steady avoidance of the demand for substantiation, a withdrawal into mystic secrecy, a continual
	reference to the infallible knowledge of the male and female Popes of Theosophy or, when that seems to need
	bolstering, to the divine authority of invisible and inaccessible Mahatmas.
	We in India admit the Guru and accept the Avatar.
	But still the Guru is only a vessel of the infinite Knowledge, the Avatar is only a particular manifestation of the
	Divine Personality.
	It is shocking to our spiritual notions to find cosmic Demiurges of a vague semi-divine character put between us and
	the Ail-Powerful and All-Loving and Kutthumi and Maurya taking the place of God.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 69</p>
<p class="P">
	One sees, finally, a new Theocracy claiming the place of the old, and that Theocracy is dominantly European.
	Indians figure numerously as prominent subordinates, just as in the British system of government Indians are
	indispensable and sometimes valued assistants.
	Or they obtain eminence on the side of pure spirituality and knowledge, just as Indians could rise to the highest
	places in the judicial service or in advisory posts, but not in the executive administration.
	But if the smaller hierophants are sometimes and rarely Indians, the theocrats and the bulk of the prophets are
	Russian, American or English.
	An Indian here and there may quicken the illumination of the Theosophist, but it is Madame Blavatsky or Mrs Besant,
	Sinnett or Eeadbeater who lays down the commandments and the Law.
	It is strange to see the present political condition of India reproducing itself in a spiritual organisation; it
	illustrates perhaps the subtle interconnection and interdependence of all individual and communal activities in the
	human being.
	But the political subordination finds its justification in the physical fact of the British rule.
	It is argued plausibly, and perhaps correctly, that without this subordination British supremacy could have no sure
	foundation.
	But where is the justification for the foreign spiritual control?
	The argument of native incapacity may be alleged.
	But I do not find this hypothesis of superiority supported by the facts.
	I do not see that Mrs Besant has a more powerful and perfect intellectuality, eloquence, personality or religious
	force than had Swami Vivekananda or that a single Theosophist has yet showed him or herself to be as mighty and pure
	a spirit as the Paramhansa Ramakrishna.
	There are Indian Yogins who have a finer and more accurate psychical knowledge than the best that can be found in
	the books of the Theosophists.
	Some even of the less advanced have given me proofs of far better-developed occult powers than any Theosophist I
	have yet known.
	The only member of the Theosophical Society who could give me any spiritual help I could not better by my unaided
	faculties, was one excluded from the esoteric section because his rare and potent experiences were unintelligible to
	the Theosophic guides; nor were his knowledge and powers gained by Theosophic methods but by following the path of
	our Yoga and the impulse of an Indian guru, one who meddled not in organisations and election cabals but lived like
	a madman, <em>unmattavat</em>.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 70</p>
<p class="P">These peculiarities of the Theosophical movement have begun to tell and the better mind of India revolts
	against Theosophy. The young who are the future, are not for the new doctrine. Yet only through India can Theosophy
	hope to survive. It may attract a certain number of European adherents, but cannot hope to control the thought and
	life of the West. Its secretive and Papal tendency is a fatal bar. Europe has done definitely with all knowledge
	that will not submit itself to scrutiny; it is finishing with the usurpations of theocracy in things spiritual as it
	has finished with them in things temporal. Even devout Catholics writhe uneasily under the shower of Papal
	encyclicals and feel what an embarrassment it is to have modern knowledge forbidden by a revenant from the Middle
	Ages or opinion fixed by a Council of priests no more spiritual, wise or illustrious than the minds they coerce with
	their irrational authority. Europe is certainly not going to exchange a Catholic for a Theosophical Pope, the
	Council of Cardinals for the Esoteric Section, or the Gospel and the Athanasian Creed for <em>Ancient Wisdom</em>
	and <em>Isis Unveiled</em>.</p>
<p class="P">Will India long keep the temper that submits to unexamined authority and blinds itself with a name? I
	believe not. We shall more and more return to the habit of going to the root of things, of seeking knowledge not
	from outside but from the Self who knows and reveals. We must more and more begin to feel that to believe a thing
	because somebody has heard from somebody else that Mrs Besant heard it from a Mahatma, is a little unsafe and
	indefinite. Even if the assurance is given direct, we shall learn to ask for the proofs. Even if Kutthumi himself
	comes and tells me, I shall certainly respect his statement, but also I shall judge it and seek its verification.
	The greatest Mahatma is only a servant of the Most High and I must see his <em>chapras</em> before I admit his
	plenary authority. The world is putting off its blinkers; it is feeling once more the divine impulse to see.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 71</p>
<p class="P">
	It is not that Theosophy is false; it is that Theosophists are weak and human.
	I am glad to believe that there is much truth in Theosophy.
	There are also considerable errors.
	Many of the things they say which seem strange and incredible to those who decline the experiment, agree with the
	general experience of Yogins; there are other statements which our experience appears to contradict or to which it
	gives a different interpretation.
	Mahatmas exist, but they are not omnipotent or infallible.
	Rebirth is a fact and the memory of our past lives is possible; but the rigid rules of time and of Karmic reaction
	laid down dogmatically by the Theosophist hierophants are certainly erroneous.
	Especially is the hotchpotch of Hindu and Buddhist mythology and Theosophic prediction served up to us by Mrs Besant
	confusing and misleading.
	At any rate it does not agree with the insight of much greater Yogins than herself.
	Like most Theosophists she seems to ignore the numerous sources and possibilities of error which assail the Yogin
	before his intellect is perfectly purified and he has his perfection in the higher and superintellectual faculties
	of the mind.
	Until then the best have to remember that the mind even of the fairly advanced is not yet divine and that it is the
	nature of the old unchastened human element to leap at misunderstandings, follow the lure of predilections and take
	premature conclusions for established truths.
	We must accept the Theosophists as enquirers; as hierophants and theocrats I think we must reject them.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If Theosophy is to survive, it must first change itself.
	It must learn that mental rectitude to which it is now a stranger and improve its moral basis.
	It must become clear, straightforward, rigidly self-searching, sceptical in the nobler sense of the word.
	It must keep the Mahatmas in the background and put God and Truth in the front.
	Its Popes must dethrone themselves and enthrone the intellectual conscience of mankind.
	If they wish to be mystic and secret like our Yogins, then they must like our Yogins assert only to the initiate and
	the trained; but if they come out into the world to proclaim their mystic truths aloud and seek power, credit and
	influence on the strength of their assertions, then they must prove.
	It need not and ought not to be suddenly or by miracles; but there must be a scientific development, we must be able
	to lay hold on the rationale and watch the process of the truths they proclaim.

<p class="P">
	I have said that I wish to write of Theosophy in no strain of unreasoning hostility or spirit of vulgar
	ridicule; yet these essays will be found to be much occupied with criticisms and often unsparing criticisms of the
	spirit and methods of Theosophists.
	There is, however, this difference between my criticisms and much that I have seen written in dispraise of the
	movement, that I censure not as an enemy but as an impartial critic, not as a hostile and incredulous outsider but
	as an earnest and careful inquirer and practical experimentalist in those fields which Theosophy seeks to make her
	own.
	Theosophy was not born with Madame Blavatsky, nor invented by the Mahatmas in the latter end of the nineteenth
	century.
	It is an ancient and venerable branch of knowledge, which unfortunately has never, in historical times, been brought
	out into the open and subjected to clear, firm and luminous tests.
	The imaginations of the cultured and the superstitions of the vulgar played havoc with its truths and vitiated its
	practice.
	It degenerated into the extravagances of the Gnostics and Rosicrucians and the charlatanism of magic and sorcery.
	The Theosophical Society was the first body of inquirers which started with the set and clear profession of bringing
	out this great mass of ancient truth into public notice and establishing it in public belief.
	The profession has not been sustained in practice.
	Instead of bringing them out into public notice they have withdrawn them into the shrouded secrecy of the Esoteric
	society; instead of establishing them to public belief, they have hampered the true development of Theosophy and
	injured its credit by allowing promise to dwarf performance and by a readiness to assert which was far beyond their
	power to verify.
	I do not deny that the Theosophical Society increases in its numbers, but it increases as a mystic sect and not in
	the strength of its true calling.
	I do not deny that it has done valuable service in appealing to the imaginations of men both in India and Europe;
	but it has appealed to their imaginations and has not convinced their reason.
	When there is so serious a failure in a strong and earnest endeavour, we must look for the cause in some defect
	which lies at the very roots of its action.
	And it is just there at the very roots of its active life that we find the vital defect of modern Theosophy.
	We find a speculative confusion which fatally ignores the true objects and the proper field of such a movement and a
	practical confusion which fatally ignores the right and necessary conditions of its success.
	They have failed to see what Theosophy rightly is and what it is not; they have failed to understand that error and
	the sources of error must be weeded out before the good corn of truth can grow.
	They have fallen into the snare of Gnostic jargon and Rosicrucian mummery and have been busy with a nebulous chase
	after Mahatmas, White Lodges and Lords of the Flame when they should have been experimenting earnestly and
	patiently, testing their results severely and arriving at sound and incontestable conclusions which they could
	present, rationally founded, first to all enquirers and then to the world at large.

	MR Besant would have us believe that Theosophy is Brahmavidya.
	The Greek Theosophia and the Sanscrit Brahmavidya, she tells us in all good faith, are identical words and identical
	things.
	Even with Mrs Besant's authority, I cannot accept this extraordinary identification.
	It can only have arisen either from her ignorance of Sanscrit or from that pervading confusion of thought and
	inability to perceive clear and trenchant distinctions which is the bane of Theosophical inquiry and Theosophical
	pronouncements.
	Vidya may be represented, though not perfectly represented by sophia; but Brahman is not Theos and cannot be Theos,
	as even the veriest tyro in philosophy, one would think, ought to know.
	We all know what Brahmavidya is, — the knowledge of the One both in Itself and in its ultimate and fundamental
	relations to the world which appears in It whether as illusion or as manifestation, whether as Maya or as Lila.
	Does Theosophy answer to this description?
	Everyone knows that it does not and cannot.
	The modern Theosophist tells us much about Mahatmas, Kamaloka, Devachan, people on Mars, people on the Moon, astral
	bodies, precipitated letters, Akashic records and a deal of other matters, of high value if true and of great
	interest whether true or not.
	But what on earth, I should like to know, has <em>all this</em> to do with Brahmavidya?
	One might just as well describe botany, zoology and entomology or for that matter, music or painting or the binomial
	theory or quadratic equations as Brahmavidya.
	In a sense they are so since everything is Brahman, — sarvam khalvidam Brahma.
	But language has its distinctions on which clear thinking depends, and we must insist on their being observed.
	All this matter of Theosophy is not Brahmavidya, but Devavidya.
	Devavidya is the true equivalent, so far as there can be an equivalent, of Theosophy.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 74</p>
<p class="P">
	I am aware that Theosophy speaks of the Logos or of several Logoi and the government of the world — not so much by
	any Logos as by the Mahatmas.
	Still, I say, that all this does not constitute Theosophy into Brahmavidya, but leaves it what it was, Devavidya.
	It is still not the knowledge of the One, not the knowledge that leads to salvation, but the knowledge of the Many,
	— of our bondage and not of our freedom, Avidya and not Vidya.
	I do not decry it for that reason, but it is necessary that it should be put in its right place and not blot out for
	us the diviner knowledge of our forefathers.
	Theosophy is or should be a wider and profounder Science, a knowledge that deals with other levels and movements of
	consciousness, planes if you like so to call them, phenomena depending on the activity of consciousness on those
	levels, worlds and beings formed by the activity of consciousness on those levels, — for what is a world but the
	synthesis in Space and Time of a particular level of consciousness, — forming a field of consciousness with which
	material Science, the Science of this immediately visible world, cannot yet deal, and for the most part, not
	believing in it as fact, refuses to deal.
	Theosophy is, therefore, properly speaking, a high scientific enquiry.
	It is not or ought not to be a system of metaphysics or a new religion.

<p class="P">
	What is Truth? said Pilate confronted with a mighty messenger of the truth, not jesting surely, not in a
	spirit of shallow lightness, but turning away from the Christ with the impatience of the disillusioned soul for
	those who still use high words that have lost their meaning and believe in great ideals which the test of the event
	has proved to be fallacious.
	What is truth, — this phantom so long pursued, so impossible to grasp firmly, — that a man young, beautiful, gifted,
	eloquent and admired should consent to be crucified for its sake?
	Have not circumstance and event justified the half-pitying, half-sorrowful question of the Roman governor?
	The Messenger suffered on the cross, and what happened to the truth that was his message?
	As Christ himself foresaw, it has never been understood even by its professors.
	For five<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="35" href="#">1</a> hundred years it was a glorious mirage for which thousands of
	men and women willingly underwent imprisonment, torture and death in order that Christ's kingdom might come on earth
	and felicity possess the nations.
	But the kingdom that came was not Christ's; it was Constantine's, it was Hildebrand's, it was Alexander Borgia's.
	For another thirteen centuries the message was — what?
	Has it not been the chief support of fanaticism, falsehood, cruelty and hypocrisy, the purveyor of selfish power,
	the keystone of a society that was everything Christ had denounced?
	Jesus died on the cross, for the benefit, it would seem, of those who united to slay him, the Sadducee, atheist and
	high priest, the Pharisee, zealot, hypocrite and persecutor and the brutal, self-seeking, callous military Roman.
	Now in its last state, after such a lamentable career, Christ's truth stands finally rejected by the world's recent
	enlightenment as a hallucination or a superstition which sometimes helpfully, sometimes harmfully amused the infancy
	of the human intellect.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 76</p>
<p class="P">
	This history is written in too pronounced characters to be the exact type of all messages that the world has
	received, but is it not in some sort a type of the fate of all truth?
	What idea has stood successfully the test of a prolonged and pitiless inquiry? what ideal has stood successfully the
	test of time?
	Has not mankind been busy for the last fifty years and more denying almost all that it had formerly affirmed?
	And now that under the name of rationalism or materialism the denial has shaped itself into some form of workably
	practical affirmation, mankind is again at its work of denying its denial and rearranging — but this time doubtingly
	— its old affirmations.
	The scepticism of Pilate would therefore seem to have some excuse in a recurrent human experience.
	Is there, indeed, such a thing as truth, — beyond of course that practical truth of persistent material appearances
	by which we govern our lives, the truth of death, birth, hunger, sexuality, pain, pleasure, commerce, money making,
	ease, discomfort, ambition, failure and success?
	Has not indeed the loftiest of our philosophical systems declared all things here to be Maya?
	And if Maya is illusion, a deceit of the thinking consciousness, then indeed there can be no truth anywhere in the
	world except that indefinable Existence which we cannot comprehend and which, after all, Buddhism, not without logic
	and plausibility, setting it down as another and more generalised sanskara, a false sensation of consciousness in
	the eternal Void, denies.
	And yet man is so constituted that he must follow after truth whether it is attained or not; something in him
	secret, masterful, essential to his existence, forbids him to be satisfied with a falsehood; the moment it is
	perceived or even believed to be a falsehood, he rejects it and the thing begins to crumble.
	If he persists in his rejection, it cannot last.
	Yesterday it was, today we see it tottering, tomorrow we shall look for it and find that it is no longer.
	It has passed back into Prakriti; it has dissolved into that of which it was made.
	For sraddha is the condition of all existence in consciousness and that to which sraddha is denied, ceases to have
	existence whether here or elsewhere, na caivamutra no iha.
	It is not, neither in this world nor in another.
	We may not unreasonably infer from this importance and this imperative necessity that Truth does really exist and
	everything is not illusion.
	If then Truth is always escaping our hold and leaving us to disillusionment and derision, it may be because we have
	neither formed any clear conception of what Truth itself is nor taken hold of the right means by which it can be
	grasped.
	Let us leave aside, for a while, Buddha's world of sanskaras; let us put aside, packed away in an accessible corner
	of the brain, Shankara's gospel of Maya, and start instead from the old Vedantic beginnings OM Tat Sat, That
	(Brahman) is the thing that Is, and Sarvam khalvidam Brahma, Verily, all this, everything of which we are aware, is
	Brahman.
	It is at least possible that we may return from this inquiry with a deeper idea both of sanskaras and of Maya and
	may find that we have answered Pilate's question by discovering the nature and conditions of Truth.

<p class="pg-num">Page 78</p>
<p class="P"> that since being is one the knowledge of the particulars must lead to the knowledge of the fundamental
	unity and they begin therefore at the bottom and climb upwards—a slow but, one might imagine, a safe method of
	procession. "Little flower in the crannies" cries Tennyson addressing a pretty blossom in the wall in lines which
	make good thought, but execrable poetry, "if I could but know what you are, I should know what God and man is."
	Undoubtedly; the question is whether, without knowing God, we can really know the flower,—know <em>it</em>, and not
	merely its name and form or all the details of its name and form. Rupa we can know &amp; analyse by the aid of
	science, nama by the aid of philosophy; but swarupa? It would seem that some third instrument is needed for that
	consummation of knowledge. The senses &amp; reason, even though aided by microscope and telescope, cannot show it to
	us. Na sandrishe tisthati rupam asya. The form of That stands not in the ken of sight. Mind and speech are not
	permitted to lead us to it, na vag gacchati na mano. Even the metaphysical logic of a Shankara stops short of that
	final victory. Naisha tarkena matir apaneya. This realisation in thought is not to be obtained by logic. All these
	various disabilities are due to one compelling cause; they are, because Sat, the truth of existence, Brahman, the
	reality of things which fills &amp; supports their idea and form, is beyond the recognisable &amp; analysable
	elements of idea and form. Anor aniyan atarkyam anupramanat. It is subtler even than elemental subtlety and
	therefore not to be deduced, induced, inferred or discovered by a reasoning which proceeds from a consideration of
	the elements of name and form and makes that its standard. This is a truth which even the greatest philosophers,
	Vedantic or unVedantic, are apt to forget; but the Sruti insists on it always.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8079</p>
<p class="P"> of matter, the twilight of vital consciousness, the broken half lights of the mind, and the master impulse
	of his nature is to yearn passionately towards the light from which [he] has fallen. Unable to find it at once, too
	little <em>dhira</em> (calm &amp; discerning) to perfect himself patiently, it is natural that he in his eagerness
	should grasp at other instruments meant for a limited utility and straining them beyond their capacity compel them
	to serve this his supreme object—which is always to recover the perfect light and by that recovery to recover also
	what dwells only in the perfect light,—the perfect &amp; unfailing bliss. From this abuse of his parts of knowledge
	have resulted three illegitimate human activities, of which Philosophy, Religion &amp; Science have severally made
	themselves guilty, the disputatious metaphysical philosophy of the schools, the theology of the Churches and the
	scientific philosophy of the laboratories. Philosophy, Religion &amp; Science have each their appointed field and
	dominion; each can help man in his great preoccupation, the attempt to know all that he can about Sat, about
	Brahman. The business of Philosophy is to arrange logically the general modes of Sat, the business of Religion is to
	arrange practically &amp; vitally the personal relations of Sat, the business of Science is to arrange observantly
	&amp; analytically the particular forms &amp; movements of Sat. They are really necessary to and ought to lean on
	each other; and, if all recognised proper limitations and boundary marks, could by their joint activity help man to
	his present attainable fullness; but by a sort of intellectual land hunger they are perpetual invaders of each
	other's dominion, deny each other's positions and therefore remain unprofitably at war through the human ages.
	Finally, all three after illegitimately occupying each other's fields insist on snatching at a knowledge of which
	they are all equally incapable—the essential nature of the world, the secret reality of Sat, the uttamam rahasyam of
	the Brahman. This error, this confusion, this sankara or illegitimate mixing of different nature and function is the
	curse of the Kali and from it arises much, if not most, of the difficulty we experience as a race in escaping from
	this misery &amp; darkness into bliss and light. It is part and a great part of Kali Kalila, the chaos of the Kali.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8281</p>
<p class="P">
	India has always attempted, though not, since the confusion of Buddhism, with any success, if not to keep the three
	to their proper division of labour — which, with the general growth of ignorance became impossible — at least,
	always to maintain or reestablish, if disturbed, some harmony between them.
	Of this attempt the Gita is the standing monument and the most perfect example.
	To see the confusion working in its untrammelled force, — and it is only so, by isolating the disease from the
	modification of curative forces, that we can observe, diagnose and afterwards find its remedy — we must go to the
	intellectual history of the European continent.
	There have been, properly speaking, two critical periods in this history, the Graeco-Roman era of philosophic
	illumination previous to Christianity and the era of modern scientific illumination which is still unexhausted.
	In the first we see the revolt of Philosophy (with Science concealed in her protective embrace) against the
	usurpation of religion.
	We find it, after achieving liberation, in its turn denying religion and usurping her sacred prerogative.
	In the modern era we see Science this time emerged and adult, keeping Philosophy behind her, in revolt against
	religion, first liberate herself, then deny religion and usurp her prerogatives, then, or as part of this final
	process of conquest, turn, deny and strike down her lofty ally and usurp also her ancient territory.
	For if Science has scorned and denied religion, she has equally scorned and denied Metaphysics.
	If she has declared God to be a barbarous myth, a fiction of dreams and terrors and longings and denied us the right
	of communion with the infinite, equally has she declared metaphysics to be an aberration of the ideative faculty, a
	false extension of logic and denied our right to recognise any metaphysical existence or anything at all which
	cannot be judged by or inferred from the results of the test tube, the scalpel, the microscope and the telescope.
	Neither, however, has she herself hesitated to dogmatise about the essential nature of existence and the mutual
	relations of its general modes, matter, life, mind and spirit.
	But for our immediate purpose it is only necessary to note the result in either of these eras of these tremendous
	usurpations.
	The result of the usurpations of philosophy was that mankind flung itself with an infinite sincerity, with a
	passionate sense of relief into the religion of an obscure Jewish sect and consented for a length of time which
	amazes us to every theological absurdity, even the most monstrous, so that it might once more be permitted to
	believe in something greater than earth and to have relations with God.
	The old philosophical spirit was torn to pieces with Hypatia in the bloodstained streets of Alexandria.
	Theology usurped her place and discoursed blindly and foolishly on transubstantiation and consubstantiality and one
	knows not what other barren mysteries.
	So far as philosophy was allowed an independent existence, she was compelled to do not her own work but the work of
	science; so we find the schoolmen elaborately determining by logic and a priori word fencing questions which could
	only be properly determined by observation and analysis.
	For Theology, for Mediaeval Religion herself did not care for this field of knowledge; she had no need for
	scientific truths just as the Jacobin Republic had “no need of chemists”; in fact she guillotined Science wherever
	its presence attracted her attention.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="36" href="#">2</a>
	But all injustice — and that means at bottom all denial of truth, of the satyam and ritam — brings about its own
	punishment or, as Religion would put it, God's visitation and vengeance.
	Science liberated, given in her strenuous emergence the strength of the Titans, avenges herself today on her old
	oppressors, on Religion, on Philosophy, breaks their temples, scorns their gods and prophets and seeks to deprive
	them even of the right to existence.
	That was the result of the Graeco-Roman illumination.
	And what will be the result of the scientific illumination, the modern enlightenment, the fiery triumph and ardent
	intellectual bigotry of the materialist?
	It is too early to foresee the final denouement, but unformed lines of it show themselves, obscure masses arise.
	Mysticism is growing obscurely in strength, as Science grew obscurely in strength in the Middle Ages.
	We see Titanic and mystic figures striding out of the East, building themselves fortresses and points of departure,
	spreading among the half-intellectual, capturing even the intellectual — vague figures of Theosophy, Spiritualism,
	Mental Science, Psychical Research, Neo-Hinduism, Neo-Buddhism, Neo-Mahomedanism, Neo-Christianity.
	The priests of Isis, the adepts and illuminati of Gnosticism, denied their triumph by the intervention of St Paul
	and the Pope, reborn into this latter age, claim now their satisfaction.
	Already some outworks of materialism are giving way, the attack grows more insistent, the defence more uncertain,
	less proudly self-confident, though not less angry, contemptuous, bitter and intolerant; the invaders increase their
	adherents, extend the number of their strongholds.
	If no wider and higher truth intervenes, it would almost seem as if the old confusion in a new form might replace
	the new.
	Perhaps an Esoteric Society or a Spiritualist Circle of High Mediums will in a few centuries be laying down for us
	what we shall think about this world and the next, what particular relations with Gods will be permitted us, what
	Influences or Initiates we shall worship.
	Who knows?
	The fires of Smithfield may yet reblaze to save heretics from the perdition which an illustrious voice has declared
	to us to be the destined doom of all who do not acknowledge Maurya and Kutthumi.

	These are not mere fantastic speculations.
	The history of humanity and the peculiar capacities of that apparently incalculable and erratic thing, human nature,
	ought to warn us of their possibility — or at least that they are not entirely impossible, in spite of the printing
	press, in spite of the clarities of Science.
	No doubt the old philosophers [thought] that with so many Stoas and Academies, such spread of education, never again
	would enlightenment be dimmed and the worship of gods and ghosts would in the end amuse none but the vulgar.
	We must accept these things as possible and examine why they are possible.
	This reaction is inevitable because Philosophy, though exceedingly high and luminous, tends to be exclusive and
	narrow and Science, though exceedingly patient, accurate and minute, tends to be limited, dry and purblind.
	They are both apt to be as dogmatic and intolerant in their own high way or in their own clear, dry way as Religion
	in her way which is not high, but intense, not clear but enthusiastic; and they live on a plane of mentality on
	which humanity at large does not yet find itself at perfect ease, cannot live without a struggle and a difficulty in
	breathing.
	They both demand from man that he shall sacrifice his heart and his imagination to his intellect, shall deny his
	full human nature and live coldly and dryly.
	You might just as well ask him to live without free breathing.
	The mental world in which we are asked to live, resembles what the life of humanity would be if the warmth of the
	sun had diminished, the earth were growing chill and its atmosphere were already too rarefied for our comfort.
	It is no use saying that he ought to live in such an atmosphere, that it will improve his mental health and vigour.
	Perhaps he ought, though I do not think so, but he cannot.
	Or rather the individual may, — everything is possible to individual man, — but the race cannot.
	The demand can never be allowed; for it is a denial of Nature, a violation of the great Mother, a displacement<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="37" href="#">3</a> of her eternal facts by the aridities of logic; it is a refusal of
	the Truth of things, of the Satyam, Ritam, and if it is persisted in, it will bring its own revenges.
	Philosophy and Science, if they are to help mankind without hurting it and themselves, must recognise that mankind
	is a complex being and his nature demands that every part of that complexity shall have its field of activity and
	every essential aspiration in him must be satisfied.
	It is his nature and his destiny to be aptakama, satisfied in his desires, in the individual and in the race —
	though always in accordance with the satyam, the ritam, which is also the sukham and sundaram, not lawlessly and
	according to aberrations and caprices.
	It was the great virtue of the ancient Hinduism, before Buddhism upset its balance and other aberrations followed,
	that it recognised in principle at least this fundamental verity, did not deny what God insists upon but strove, it
	does not matter whether perfectly or imperfectly, to put everything in its place and create a natural harmony.

<p class="P">
	The Vedanta, that solemn affirmation of the ultimate truths beyond which no human thinking has ever proceeded
	or can proceed, looking deep into the last recesses where existence takes refuge from the scrutiny of the Mind,
	affirms there as the beginning and the end of all possible description of the infinite Knowable-Unknowable three
	terms, Being, Comprehension and Delight.
	They are the initial and final trinity of existence.
	From them all phenomena proceed, to them all phenomena seek to return.
	This personality envisaged as myself, has come out of infinite being, lives in infinite being; emmeshed in the
	limitations of form and idea it seeks laboriously to recover itself as the infinite being.
	This Awareness in me which centralised in my personality suffers and examines all impressions that reach me out of
	the infinite existence, is a selection from an infinite Awareness contemplating itself in its whole and its parts;
	localised and limited, involved at first in this form it has created, it emerges out of its creation and seeks first
	to comprehend that and then to comprehend itself; master in some sort of its surroundings, it seeks to become master
	of itself; enlarging always from the factor to the sum, from the particular to the general, from the form to the
	essence it seeks to recover itself as the infinite self-comprehension.
	This Will to be and know in myself is essentially the joy of being and the joy of comprehending — Ananda, Delight;
	and the particular delight in me is but a spark, a wave, a foam-crest of an infinite delight; fastened at first on
	partial, limited and transient pleasures, it seeks always to enlarge them, to combine, to intensify; it goes out
	seeking for new forms of happiness; it goes in turning from the vital joy to sense-delights, from sense-delights to
	pleasures of emotion, from pleasures of emotion to intellectual satisfaction, from intellectual satisfaction to the
	self-existent bliss of the spirit which depends on no object or circumstance; in all these motions it is seeking to
	recover itself as infinite Delight.
	In this way the final perceptions of Vedanta explain the whole process and labour of consciousness in the world.
</p>
<p class="P">
	These three, Sat, Chit and Ananda are one Trinity, Sachchidananda.
	They are not three different factors making a single sum, neither are any two of them merely attributes, even
	inseparable and invariable attributes, of the third.
	No doubt, they are always coexistent.
	Where there is no delight, latent or developed, there can be no existence; where there is no awareness self-absorbed
	or manifest, there can be no existence.
	Follow existence into utter and blind inertia, consciousness sits secret in that night; follow consciousness into
	the abyss of desolation, joy sits self-stunned in the mask of that misery.
	But their coexistence is only an exterior sign of their essential unity.
	They do not exist separately, because they are not different from each other, — all three are one thing-in-itself
	seen diversely; seen sensationally, touching the fibres of conscious life in us it is delight; seen mentally,
	touching the fibres of living consciousness, it is comprehension; seen spiritually, touching the very core of this
	living and conscious I, it is being.
	But the thing-in-itself is one; it is Brahman.
	Go behind the Trinity and you can say nothing of it but this, Tat, anirdeshyam, the indefinable, That which
	transcends all words and thoughts; seek to know and define it, you come back to the universal and mysterious
	Trinity, Sachchidananda, being, comprehension and delight.
	This is all that you can know fundamentally about yourself; you are That which Is, which, being, comprehends Its own
	existence, which, comprehending, has in its silence of being or in its play of comprehension a self-existent
	delight.
	It is all we can know fundamentally and all we need to know, for, this once grasped and pursued in knowledge, the
	whole of life begins to unroll itself in its secret motion and purpose to our gaze.

<p class="pg-num">Page 8786</p>
<p class="P">
	Against this sublime Trinity of the Vedanta, this penetrating analysis of the reality of things, this discovery of
	the real existence of God in the world, the appearances of that world seem to protest and militate.
	That which strikes us most saliently and leaps on us fiercely at every turn, is grief and pain, not delight; that
	which besieges our eyes always and everywhere is not conscious awareness, but the inertia or the brute movement of
	unconscious Matter.
	Existence we cannot deny; the voice of the mighty Life in us rejects always the systems of Nihilism and leaves them
	to the enjoyment of a few curious and subtle metaphysicians; nothing either in science or in experience supports the
	purely metaphysical idea of Nullity.
	But this undeniable existence stands before us rather as an inextricable confusion of pleasure and pain than as
	synonymous with delight; in its vast fields sown with worlds we find instead of an omnipresent consciousness rather
	an omnipresent non-consciousness in which tongues of consciousness flame like little points and tongues of fire on a
	huge inert pyre of various timber.
	Be not deceived, answers the Vedantin; appearances can never be trusted till the secrets behind them are fathomed.
	To the eye's unvarying experience the sun is a globe of fire that voyages round its worshipped earth; generations so
	conceived it and would have mocked at the truth; these solid appearances are an assemblage of gases; the colour of a
	rose is a brilliant deceit of the vision.
	Interrogate consciousness to find what it is or holds and unconsciousness to discover its secrets.
	Interrogate not only the state of waking but the states of dream and sleep.
	You will find at the end of long, patient and searching experiments that the confused consciousness of dream was
	confused only in the receiving parts of the material waking mind and behind it was a state of awareness even more
	perfect and orderly than the awareness of our waking life.
	You will find that the consciousness in abeyance of dreamless sleep was in abeyance only in the overpowered and
	cessant parts of the same material waking mind and behind it was a most exalted and perfect state of awareness which
	stands near the threshold of the House of God in which we really dwell; for here we are only labourers or overseers
	in His outer farms.
	It is admitted that when we are in sound sleep we dream; we are conscious, when we are swooned or stunned only a
	part of our consciousness, the outward, the here active is withdrawn.
	When you have interrogated unconsciousness in yourself, interrogate it in the tree and the clod.
	You will find, for by that time you will have entered into the king doms within and learned to command a
	self-exceeding experience of being, that in the tree and the rock there is the same being, the same consciousness,
	the same principle of Will to live, of delight, in a word, that is [in] yourself.
	The unconsciousness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="38" href="#">1</a> of the tree and the rock is the same
	unconsciousness as that which occupies your body when mind is withdrawn from the observation of its working.
	It is the sleep, the universal trance of Matter.
	And that means, eventually, the trance of consciousness forgetting itself in its own symbol or form.
	Consciousness in this its outer shell has become to the appearance something else which seems not to have any
	resemblance to conscious being, as gas becoming water is to appearance something else which has no remotest gaseous
	semblance.
	The truth sits veiled behind the appearance, self-absorbed; there is in all things, without exception, “That which
	is conscious in these conscious and unconscious existences, that which is awake in these who sleep.”

</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 89</p>
<p class="P">
	There is a silence behind life as well as within it and it is only in this more secret, sustaining silence
	that we can hear clearly the voice of God.
	In the noise of the world we hear only altered and disturbed echoes of it; for the Voice comes always — who else
	speaks to us on our journey?
	— but the gods of the heart, the gods of the mind, the gods of desire, the gods of sense take up the divine cry,
	intercept it and alter it for their purposes.
	Krishna calls to us, but the first note, even the opening power or sweetness, awakes a very brouhaha of these
	echoes.
	It is not the fault of these poor gods.
	The accent of power is so desirable, the note of sweetness is so captivating that they must seize it, they would be
	dull and soulless, there would be no hope of their redemption if they did not at once leap at it and make it their
	own.
	But in becoming their own, it ceases to be entirely his.
	How many who have the religious faith and the religious temperament, are following the impulses of their heart, the
	cravings of their desire, the urgency of their senses, the dictates of their opinion when they fully imagine that
	their God is leading them!
	And they do well, for God is leading them.
	It is the way He has chosen for them, and since He has chosen it, it is the best and wisest and most fruitful way
	for them.
	Still it is their God — not one they have made in their own image as the Atheist believes, but One who makes Himself
	in the image that they prefer, the image that best suits with their nature or their development.
	“In whatever way men come to me, in that way I love and cleave to them.”
	It is a saying of fathomless depth which contains the seed of the whole truth about God and religion.
	After all it is only in this way that the conditioned can meet the Absolute, that which has a nature or dharma of
	its own with that which is beyond all limit of nature or dharma.
	After the meeting of the soul with God, — well, that is a different matter.
	The secrets of His nuptial chamber cannot all be spoken.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless, there is a higher way of meeting him than that which leads us through subjection to the Gods.
	By perfect Love, by perfect Joy, by perfect Satisfaction, by perfected mind one can hear what the Voice truly says
	if not the Voice itself, — catch the kernel of the message with a sort of ecstatic perfection, even if afterwards
	the Gods dilate on it and by attempting to amplify and complete, load it with false corollaries or prevent some
	greater fullness of truth from arriving to us.
	Therefore this way also, though it is high, cannot be the highest.

	Initial Definitions and Descriptions
</h1>
<p class="P">
	Yoga has four powers and objects, purity, liberty, beatitude and perfection.
	Whosoever has consummated these four mightinesses in the being of the transcendental, universal, lilamaya and
	individual God is the complete and absolute Yogin.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All manifestations of God are manifestations of the absolute Parabrahman.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Absolute Parabrahman is unknowable to us, not because It is the nothingness of all that we are, for rather
	whatever we are in truth or in seeming is nothing but Parabrahman, but because It is pre-existent and supra-existent
	to even the highest and purest methods and the most potent and illimitable instruments of which soul in the body is
	capable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In Parabrahman knowledge ceases to be knowledge and becomes an inexpressible identity.
	Become Parabrahman, if thou wilt and if That will suffer thee, but strive not to know It; for thou shalt not succeed
	with these instruments and in this body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In reality thou art Parabrahman already and ever wast and ever will be.
	To become Parabrahman in any other sense, thou must depart utterly out of world manifestation and out even of world
	transcendence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Why shouldst thou hunger after departure from manifestation as if the world were an evil?
	Has not That manifested itself in thee and in the world and art thou wiser and purer and better than the Absolute, O
	mind-deceived soul in the mortal?
	When That withdraws thee, then thy going hence is inevitable; until Its force is laid on thee, thy going is
	impossible, cry thy mind never so fiercely and wailingly for departure.
	Therefore neither desire nor shun the world, but seek the bliss and purity and freedom and greatness of God in
	whatsoever state or experience or environment.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 94</p>
<p class="P">
	So long as thou hast any desire, be it the desire of non-birth or the desire of liberation, thou canst not attain to
	Parabrahman.
	For That has no desires, neither of birth nor of non-birth, nor of world, nor of departure from world.
	The Absolute is unlimited by thy desire as It is inaccessible to thy knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If thou wouldst know Paratpara brahman, then know It as It chooses to manifest Itself in world and transcending it —
	for transcendence also is a relation to world and not the sheer Absolute, — since otherwise It is unknowable.
	This is the simultaneous knowing and not knowing spoken of in the Vedanta.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Of Parabrahman we should not say that “It” is world-transcendent or world-immanent or related or non-related to the
	world; for all these ideas of world and not-world, of transcendence and immanence and relation are expressions of
	thought by which mind puts its own values on the self-manifestation of Parabrahman to Its own principle of knowledge
	and we cannot assert any, even the highest of them to be the real reality of that which is at once all and beyond
	all, nothing and beyond nothing.
	A profound and unthinking silence is the only attitude which the soul manifested in world should adopt towards the
	Absolute.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We know of Parabrahman that It Is, in a way in which no object is and no state in the world, because whenever and in
	whatever direction we go to the farthest limits of soul-experience or thought-experience or body-experience or any
	essential experience whatsoever, we come to the brink of That and perceive It to be, unknowably, without any
	capacity of experiencing about it any farther truth whatsoever.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="P">
	When thy soul retiring within from depth to depth and widening without from vastness to vastness stands in the
	silence of its being before an unknown and unknowable from which and towards which world is seen to exist as a thing
	neither materially real nor mentally real and yet not to be described as a dream or a falsehood, then know that thou
	art standing in the Holy of Holies, before the Veil that shall not be rent.
	In this mortal body thou canst not rend it, nor in any other body; nor in the state of self in body nor in the state
	of pure self, nor in waking nor in sleep nor in trance, nor in any state or circumstances whatsoever for thou must
	be beyond state before thou canst enter into the Paratpara brahman.
</p>
<p class="P">
	That is the unknown God to whom no altar can be raised and no worship offered; universe is His only altar, existence
	is His only worship.
	That we are, feel, think, act or are but do not feel, do not think, do not act is for That enough.
	To That, the saint is equal with the sinner, activity with inactivity, man with the mollusc, since all are equally
	Its manifestations.
	These things at least are true of the Parabrahman and Para Purusha, which is the Highest that we know and the
	nearest to the Absolute.
	But what That is behind the veil or how behind the veil It regards Itself and its manifestations is a thing no mind
	can assume to tell or know; and he is equally ignorant and presumptuous who raises and inscribes to It an altar or
	who pretends to declare the Unknown to those who know that they can know It not.
	Confuse not thought, bewilder not the soul of man in its forward march, but turn to the Universe and know That in
	this, Tad va etat, for so only and in these terms It has set itself out to be known to those who are in the
	universe.
	Be not deceived by Ignorance, be not deceived by knowledge; there is none bound and none free and none seeking
	freedom but only God playing at these things in the extended might of His self-conscious being, para maya, mahimanam
	asya, which we call the universe.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-object-of-our-yoga">
	The Object of Our Yoga
</h1>
<p class="P">
	The object of our Yoga is self-perfection, not self-annulment.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There are two paths set for the feet of the Yogin, withdrawal from the universe and perfection in the Universe; the
	first comes by asceticism, the second is effected by tapasya; the first receives us when we lose God in Existence,
	the second is attained when we fulfil existence in God.
	Let ours be the path of perfection, not of abandonment; let our aim be victory in the battle, not the escape from
	all conflict.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Buddha and Shankara supposed the world to be radically false and miserable; therefore escape from the world was to
	them the only wisdom.
	But this world is Brahman, the world is God, the world is Satyam, the world is Ananda; it is our misreading of the
	world through mental egoism that is a falsehood and our wrong relation with God in the world that is a misery.
	There is no other falsity and no other cause of sorrow.
</p>
<p class="P">
	God created the world in Himself through Maya; but the Vedic meaning of Maya is not illusion, it is wisdom,
	knowledge, capacity, wide extension in consciousness.
	Prajna prasrita purani.
	Omnipotent Wisdom created the world, it is not the organised blunder of some Infinite Dreamer; omniscient Power
	manifests or conceals it in Itself or Its own delight, it is not a bondage imposed by His own ignorance on the free
	and absolute Brahman.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="P">
	If the world were Brahman's self-imposed nightmare, to awake from it would be the natural and only goal of our
	supreme endeavour; or if life in the world were irrevocably bound to misery, a means of escape from this bondage
	would be the sole secret worth discovering.
	But perfect truth in world-existence is possible, for God here sees all things with the eye of truth; and perfect
	bliss in the world is possible, for God enjoys all things with the sense of unalloyed freedom.
	We also can enjoy this truth and bliss, called by the Veda amritam, Immortality, if by casting away our egoistic
	existence into perfect unity with His being we consent to receive the divine perception and the divine freedom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The world is a movement of God in His own being; we are the centres and knots of divine consciousness which sum up
	and support the processes of His movement.
	The world is His play with His own self-conscious delight, He who alone exists, infinite, free and perfect; we are
	the self-multiplications of that conscious delight, thrown out into being to be His playmates.
	The world is a formula, a rhythm, a symbol-system expressing God to Himself in His own consciousness, — it has no
	material existence but exists only in His consciousness and self-expression; we, like God, are in our inward being
	That which is expressed, but in our outward being terms of that formula, notes of that rhythm, symbols of that
	system.
	Let us lead forward God's movement, play out His play, work out His formula, execute His harmony, express Him
	through ourselves in His system.
	This is our joy and our self-fulfilment; to this end we who transcend and exceed the universe, have entered into
	universe-existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Perfection has to be worked out, harmony has to be accomplished.
	Imperfection, limitation, death, grief, ignorance, matter, are only the first terms of the formula — unintelligible
	till we have worked out the wider terms and reinterpreted the formulary; they are the initial discords of the
	musician's tuning.
	Out of imperfection we have to construct perfection, out of limitation to discover infinity, out of death to find
	immortality, out of grief to recover divine bliss, out of ignorance to rescue divine self-knowledge, out of matter
	to reveal Spirit.
	To work out this end for ourselves and for humanity is the object of our Yogic practice.

<p class="P">
	By Yoga we can rise out of falsehood into truth, out of weakness into force, out of pain and grief
	into bliss, out of bondage into freedom, out of death into immortality, out of darkness into light, out of confusion
	into purity, out of imperfection into perfection, out of self-division into unity, out of Maya into God.
	All other utilisation of Yoga is for special and fragmentary advantages not always worth pursuing.
	Only that which aims at possessing the fullness of God is purna Yoga; the sadhaka of the Divine Perfection is the
	purna Yogin.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Our aim must be to be perfect as God in His being and bliss is perfect, pure as He is pure, blissful as He is
	blissful, and, when we are ourselves siddha in the purna Yoga, to bring all mankind to the same divine perfection.
	It does not matter if for the present we fall short of our aim, so long as we give ourselves<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="39" href="#">1</a> whole-heartedly to the attempt and by living constantly in it and for it move
	forward even two inches upon the road; even that will help to lead humanity out of the struggle and twilight in
	which it now dwells into the luminous joy which God intends for us.
	But whatever our immediate success, our unvarying aim must be to perform the whole journey and not lie down content
	in any wayside stage or imperfect resting place.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All Yoga which takes you entirely away from the world, is a high but narrow specialisation of divine tapasya.
	God in His perfection embraces everything; you also must become all-embracing.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 99</p>
<p class="P">
	God in His ultimate existence beyond all manifestation and all knowledge, is the Absolute Parabrahman; in relation
	to the world He is that which transcends all universal existence while regarding it or in turning away from it; He
	is that which contains and upholds the universe, He is that which becomes the universe and He is the universe and
	everything which it contains.
</p>
<p class="P">
	He is also Absolute and Supreme Personality playing in the universe and as the universe; in the universe He appears
	to be its Soul and Lord, as the universe He appears to be the motion or process of the Will of the Lord and to
	become all the subjective and objective results of the motion.
	All the states of the Brahman, the transcendent, the continent, the universal, the individual are informed and
	sustained by the divine Personality.
	He is both the Existent and the state of existence.
	We call the state of existence the Impersonal Brahman, the Existent the Personal Brahman.
	There is no difference between them except to the play of our consciousness; for every impersonal state depends upon
	a manifest or secret Personality and can reveal the Personality which it holds and veils and every Personality
	attaches to itself and can plunge itself into an impersonal existence.
	This they can do because Personality and Impersonality are merely different states of self-consciousness in one
	Absolute Being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Philosophies and religions dispute about the priority of different aspects of God and different Yogins, Rishis and
	Saints have preferred this or that philosophy or religion.
	Our business is not to dispute about any of them, but to realise and become all of them, not to follow after any
	aspect to the exclusion of the rest, but to embrace God in all His aspects and beyond aspect.
</p>
<p class="P">
	God descending into world in various forms has consummated on this earth the mental and bodily form which we call
	humanity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 100</p>
<p class="P">
	He has manifested in the world through the play of all-governing Soul with its own formative Will or Shakti a rhythm
	of existence of which Matter is the lowest term and pure being the highest.
	Mind and Life stand upon Matter (Manas and Prana on Annam) and make the lower half of world-existence (aparardha);
	pure consciousness and pure bliss proceed out of pure Being (Chit and Ananda out of Sat) and make the upper half of
	world-existence.
	Pure idea (vijnana) stands as the link between the two.
	These seven principles or terms of existence are the basis of the sevenfold world of the Puranas (Satyaloka, Tapas,
	Jana, Mahar, Swar, Bhuvar and Bhur).
</p>
<p class="P">
	The lower hemisphere in this arrangement of consciousness consists of the three vyahritis of the Veda, “Bhur,
	Bhuvah, Swar”; they are states of consciousness in which the principles of the upper world are expressed or try to
	express themselves under different conditions.
	Pure in their own homes, they are in this foreign country subject to perverse, impure and disturbing combinations
	and workings.
	The ultimate object of life is to get rid of the perversity, impurity and disturbance and express them perfectly in
	these other conditions.
	Your life on this earth is a divine poem that you are translating into earthly language or a strain of music which
	you are rendering into words.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Being in Sat is one in multiplicity, one that regards its multiplicity without being lost or confused in it and
	multiplicity that knows itself as one without losing the power of multiple play in the universe.
	Under the conditions of mind, life and body, ahankara is born, the subjective or objective form of consciousness is
	falsely taken for self-existent being, the body for an independent reality and the ego for an independent
	personality; the one loses itself in us in its multiplicity and when it recovers its unity, finds it difficult,
	owing to the nature of mind, to preserve its play of multiplicity.
	Therefore when we are absorbed in world, we miss God in Himself; when we seek God, we miss Him in the world.
	Our business is to break down and dissolve the mental ego and get back to our divine unity without losing our power
	of individual and multiple existence in the universe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 101</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness in Chit is luminous, free, illimitable and effective; that which it is aware of as Chit (Jnanashakti)
	it fulfils infallibly as Tapas (Kriyashakti); for Jnanashakti is only the stable and comprehensive, Kriyashakti only
	the motional and intensive form of one self-luminous Conscious Being.
	They are one power of conscious force of God (Chit-Shakti of Sat-Purusha).
	But in the lower hemisphere, under the conditions of mind, life and body, the luminousness becomes divided and
	broken up into uneven rays, the freedom trammelled by egoism and unequal forms, the effectiveness veiled by the
	uneven play of forces.
	We have, therefore, states of consciousness, non-consciousness and false consciousness, knowledge and ignorance and
	false knowledge, effective force and inertia and ineffective force.
	Our business is by renouncing our divided and unequal individual force of action and thought into the one, undivided
	universal Chitshakti of Kali to replace our egoistic activities by the play in our body of the universal Kali and
	thus exchange blindness and ignorance for knowledge and ineffective human strength for the divine effective Force.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Delight in Ananda is pure, unmixed, one and yet multitudinous.
	Under the conditions of mind, life and body it becomes divided, limited, confused and misdirected and owing to
	shocks of unequal forces and uneven distribution of Ananda subject to the duality of positive and negative
	movements, grief and joy, pain and pleasure.
	Our business is to dissolve these dualities by breaking down their cause and plunge ourselves into the ocean of
	divine bliss, one, multitudinous, evenly distributed (sama), which takes delight from all things and recoils
	painfully from none.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In brief, we have to replace dualities by unity, egoism by divine consciousness, ignorance by divine wisdom, thought
	by divine knowledge, weakness, struggle and effort by self-contented divine force, pain and false pleasure by divine
	bliss.
	This is called in the language of Christ bringing down the kingdom of heaven on earth, or in modern language,
	realising and effectuating God in the world.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Humanity is, upon earth, the form of life chosen for this human aspiration and divine accomplishment; all other
	forms of life either do not need it or are ordinarily incapable of it unless they change into humanity.
	The divine fullness is therefore the sole real aim of humanity.
	It has to be effected in the individual in order that it may be effected in the race.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Humanity is a mental existence in a living body; its basis is matter, its centre and instrument mind and its medium
	life.
	This is the condition of average or natural humanity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="P">
	In every human being there is concealed (avyakta) the four higher principles.
	Mahas, pure ideality in vijnana, is not a vyahriti but the source of the vyahritis, the bank upon which mental,
	vital and bodily action draw and turn its large and infinite wealth into small coin of the lower existence.
	Vijnana being the link between the divine state and the human animal is the door of escape for man into the
	supernatural or divine humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Inferior mankind gravitates downward from mind towards life and body; average mankind dwells constant in mind
	limited by and looking towards life and body; superior mankind levitates upward either to idealised mentality or to
	pure idea, direct truth of knowledge and spontaneous truth of existence; supreme mankind rises to divine beatitude
	and from that level either goes upward to pure Sat and Parabrahman or remains to beatify its lower members and raise
	to divinity in itself and others this human existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The man who dwells in the higher or divine and now hidden hemisphere of his consciousness, having rent the veil, is
	the true superman and the last product of that progressive self-manifestation of God in world, Spirit out of matter,
	which is now called the principle of evolution.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To rise into divine existence, force, light and bliss and recast in that mould all mundane existence is the supreme
	aspiration of religion and the complete practical aim of Yoga.
	The aim is to realise God in the universe, but it cannot be done without realising God transcendent of the Universe.

<p class="pg-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P">
	Parabrahman is the Absolute, and because It is the Absolute, it cannot be reduced into terms of knowledge.
	You can know the Infinite in a way, but you cannot know the Absolute.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All things in existence or non-existence are symbols of the Absolute created in self-consciousness (Chid-Atman); by
	Its symbols the Absolute can be known so far as the symbols reveal or hint at it, but even the knowledge of the
	whole sum of symbols does not amount to real knowledge of the Absolute.
	You can become Parabrahman; you cannot know Parabrahman.
	Becoming Parabrahman means going back through self-consciousness into Parabrahman, for you already are That, only
	you have projected yourself forward in self-consciousness into its terms or symbols, Purusha and Prakriti through
	which you uphold the universe.
	Therefore, to become Parabrahman void of terms or symbols you must cease out of the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	By becoming Parabrahman void of Its self-symbols you do not become anything you are not already, nor does the
	universe cease to operate.
	It only means that God throws back out of the ocean of manifest consciousness one stream or movement of Himself into
	that from which all consciousness proceeded.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 104</p>
<p class="P">
	All who go out of universe-consciousness, do not necessarily go into Parabrahman.
	Some go into undifferentiated Nature (Avyakrita Prakriti), some lose themselves in God, some pass into a dark state
	of non-recognition of universe, (Asat, Shunya), some into a luminous state of non-recognition of universe — Pure
	Undifferentiated Atman, Pure Sat or Existence-Basis of Universe, — some into a temporary state of deep sleep
	(sushupti) in the impersonal principles of Ananda, Chit or Sat.
	All these are forms of release and the ego gets from God by His Maya or Prakriti the impulse towards any one of them
	to which the supreme Purusha chooses to direct him.
	Those whom He wishes to liberate, yet keep in the world, He makes jivanmuktas or sends them out again as His
	vibhutis, they consenting to wear for the divine purposes a temporary veil of Avidya, which does not at all bind
	them and which they can rend or throw off very easily.
	Therefore to lust after becoming Parabrahman is a sort of luminous illusion or sattwic play of Maya; for in reality
	there is none bound and none free and none needing to be freed and all is only God's Lila, Parabrahman's play of
	manifestation.
	God uses this sattwic Maya in certain egos in order to draw them upwards in the line of His special purpose and for
	these egos it is the only right and possible path.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the aim of our Yoga is Jivanmukti in the universe; not because we need to be freed or for any other reason, but
	because that is God's will in us, we have to live released in the world, not released out of the world.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Jivanmukta has, for perfect knowledge and self-fulfilment to stand on the threshold of Parabrahman, but not to
	cross the threshold.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The statement he brings back from the threshold is that That is and we are That, but what That is or is not, words
	cannot describe, nor mind discriminate.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Parabrahman being the Absolute is indescribable by any name or definite conception.
	It is not Being or Non-Being, but something of which Being and Non-Being are primary symbols; not Atman or unAtman
	or Maya; not Personality or Impersonality; not Quality or Non-Quality; not Consciousness or Non-Consciousness; not
	Bliss or Non-Bliss; not Purusha or Prakriti; not god nor man nor animal; not release nor bondage; but something of
	which all these are primary or derivative, general or particular symbols.
	Still, when we say Parabrahman is not this or that, we mean that It cannot in its essentiality be limited to this or
	that symbol or any sum of symbols; in a sense Parabrahman is all this and all this is Parabrahman.
	There is nothing else which all this can be.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 105</p>
<p class="P">
	Parabrahman being Absolute is not subject to logic, for logic applies only to the determinate.
	We talk confusion if we say that the Absolute cannot manifest the determinate and therefore the universe is false or
	non-existent.
	The very nature of the Absolute is that we do not know what it is or is not, what it can do or cannot do; we have no
	reason to suppose that there is anything it cannot do or that its Absoluteness is limited by any kind of impotency.
	We experience spiritually that when we go beyond everything else we come to something Absolute; we experience
	spiritually that the universe is in the nature of a manifestation proceeding, as it were, from the Absolute; but all
	these words and phrases are merely intellectual terms trying to express the inexpressible.
	We must state what we see as best we can, but need not dispute what others see or state; rather we must accept and
	in our own system locate and account for what they have seen and stated.
	Our only dispute is with those who deny credit to the vision or freedom and value to the statements of others; not
	with those who are content with stating their own vision.
	A philosophical or religious system is only a statement of that arrangement of existence in universe which God has
	revealed to us as our status of being.
	It is given in order that the mind may have something to stand upon while we act in Prakriti.
	But our vision need not be precisely the same in arrangement as the vision of others, nor is the form of thought
	that suits our mentality bound to suit a mentality differently constituted.
	Firmness, without dogmatism, in our own system, toleration, without weakness, of all other systems should therefore
	be our intellectual outlook.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 106</p>
<p class="P">
	You will find disputants questioning your system on the ground that it is not consistent with this or that Shastra
	or this or that great authority, whether philosopher, saint or Avatar.
	Remember then that realisation and experience are alone of essential importance.
	What Shankara argued or Vivekananda conceived intellectually about existence or even what Ramakrishna stated from
	his multitudinous and varied realisation, is only of value to you so far as you [are] moved by God to accept and
	renew it in your own experience.
	The opinions of thinkers and saints and Avatars should be accepted as hints but not as fetters.
	What matters to you is what you have seen or what God in His universal personality or impersonally or again
	personally in some teacher, guru or pathfinder undertakes to show to you in the path of Yoga.

</h1>
<p class="P">
	God or Para Purusha is Parabrahman unmanifest and inexpressible turned towards a certain kind of
	manifestation or expression, of which the two eternal terms are Atman and Jagati, Self and Universe.
	Atman becomes in self-symbol all existences in the universe; so too, the universe when known, resolves all its
	symbols into Atman.
	God being Parabrahman is Himself Absolute, neither Atman nor Maya nor unAtman; neither Being nor Not-Being (Sat,
	Asat); neither Becoming nor non-Becoming (Sambhuti, Asambhuti); neither Quality nor non-Quality (Saguna, Nirguna);
	neither Consciousness nor non-consciousness, (Chaitanya, Jada); neither Soul nor Nature (Purusha, Prakriti); neither
	Bliss nor non-Bliss; neither man nor god nor animal; He is beyond all these things, He maintains and contains all
	these things; in Himself as world He is and becomes all these things.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The only difference between Parabrahman and Parapurusha is that we think of the first as something beyond our
	universe-existence, expressed here indeed, but still inexpressible, and of the second as something approaching our
	universe-existence, inexpressible indeed, but still here expressed.
	It is as if, in reading a translation of the Ramayan or Homer's Iliad, we were to look at the unapproachable
	something no translator can seize and say “This is not the Ramayan”, “This is not the Iliad” and yet, looking at the
	comparative adequacy of the expressions which do succeed in catching something of the original spirit and intention,
	were at the same time to say “This is Homer”, “This is Valmekie.”
	There is no other difference except this of standpoint.
	The Upanishads speak of the Absolute Parabrahman as Tat; they say Sa when they speak of the Absolute Parapurusha.

	Natural and Supernatural Man</h2>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-evolutionary-aim-in-yoga">	The Evolutionary Aim in Yoga</h1>
<p class="P">
	In the Katha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="40" href="#">1</a> Upanishad there occurs one of those powerful and
	pregnant phrases, containing a world of meaning in a point of verbal space, with which the Upanishads are thickly
	sown.
	Yogo hi prabhavapyayau.
	For Yoga is the beginning and ending of things.
	In the Puranas the meaning of the phrase is underlined and developed.
	By Yoga God made the world, by Yoga He will draw it into Himself in the end.
	But not only the original creation and final dissolution of the universe, all great changes of things, creations,
	evolutions, destructions are effected by the essential process of Yoga, tapasya.
	In this ancient view Yoga presents itself as the effective, perhaps the essential and real executive movement of
	Nature herself in all her processes.
	If this is so in the general workings of Nature, if that is to say, a divine Knowledge and a divine Will in things
	by putting itself into relation with objects is the true cause of all force and effectuality, the same rule should
	hold good in human activities.
	It should hold good especially of all conscious and willed processes of psychological discipline, — Yogic systems,
	as we call them; Yoga can really be nothing but a consummate and self-conscious natural process intended to effect
	rapidly objects which the ordinary natural movement works out slowly, in the tardy pace of a secular or even
	millennial evolution.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There is an apparent difference.
	The aim put before us in Yoga is God; the aim of Nature is to effect supernature; but these two aims are of one
	piece and intention.
	God and supernature are only one the real and the other the formal aspect of the one unattainable fulfilment towards
	which our human march is in its ascent directed.
	Yoga for man is the upward working of Nature liberated from slow evolution and long relapses and self-conscious in
	divine or human knowledge.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 109</p>
<p class="P">
	God is That which is the All and yet exceeds and transcends the All; there is nothing in existence which is not God,
	but God is neither the sum of existence nor anything in that sum, except symbolically, in image to His own
	consciousness.
	In other words, everything that exists, separately, is a particular symbol and the whole sum of existence is a
	general symbol which tries to translate the untranslatable existence, God, into the terms of world-consciousness.
	It is intended to try, it is not intended to succeed; for the moment it succeeds, it ceases to be itself and becomes
	that untranslatable something from which it started, God.
	No symbol is intended to express God perfectly, not even the highest; but it is the privilege of the highest symbols
	to lose in Him their separate definiteness, cease to be symbols and become in consciousness that which is
	symbolised.
	Humanity is such a symbol or eidolon of God; we are made, to use the Biblical phrase, in His image; and by that is
	meant not a formal image, but the image of His being and personality; we are of the essence of His divinity and of
	the quality of His divinity; we are formed in the mould and bear the stamp of a divine being and a divine knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In everything that exists phenomenally, or, as I shall prefer to say, going deeper into the nature of things,
	symbolically, there are two parts of being, thing in itself and symbol, Self and Nature, res (thing that is) and
	factum (thing that is done or made), immutable being and mutable becoming, that which is supernatural to it and that
	which is natural.
	Every state of existence has some force in it which drives it to transcend itself.
	Matter moves towards becoming life, Life travails towards becoming Mind, Mind aspires towards becoming ideal Truth,
	Truth rises towards becoming divine and infinite Spirit.
	The reason is that every symbol, being a partial expression of God, reaches out to and seeks to become its own
	entire reality; it aspires to become its real self by transcending its apparent self.
	Thing that is made, is attracted towards thing that is, becoming towards being, the natural towards the
	supernatural, symbol towards thing-in-itself, Nature towards God.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 110</p>
<p class="P">
	The upward movement is, then, the means towards self-fulfilment in this world; but it is not imperative on all
	objects.
	For there are three conditions for all changeable existences, the upward ascension, the arrested status and the
	downward lapse.
	Nature in its lower states moves upward indeed in the mass, but seeks the final salvation for only a limited number
	of its individuals.
	It is not every form of matter that organises life although every form of matter teems with the spirit of life and
	is full of its urgent demand for release and self-manifestation.
	Not every form of life organises mind, although in all forms of life mind is there, insistent, seeking for its
	escape and self-expression.
	Nor is every mental being fitted to organise the life of ideal truth, although in every mental being, in dog and ape
	and worm no less than in man, the imprisoned spirit of truth and knowledge seeks for its escape and self-expression.
	Nature in each realised state of her<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="41" href="#">2</a> building seeks first to assure the
	natural existence of her creatures in that state; only after this primary aim is accomplished does she seek through
	the best fitted of them to escape from her works, to break down what she has built and arrive at something beyond.
	It is not till she reaches man that she arrives at a type of being of which every individual is essentially capable
	of realising not only the natural but the supernatural within it; and even this is true with modifications, with
	qualifications.
	But of this it will be better to speak at greater length in another connection.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless, it remains true that the upward movement is the master movement of Nature; arrested status is a lower
	fulfilment, and if perfect, a transient perfection.
	It is a perfection in the realms of struggle and in the style of passing forms, a fulfilment in the kingdoms of
	Ashanaya Mrityu, Hunger who is death, Hunger that creates and feeds upon its creations; the upward movement is that
	which leads up through death to immortality and realises in this earth of the body the blissful and luminous kingdom
	of heaven; the downward lapse is destruction, Hell, a great perdition, mahati vinashtih.
	These are the three gatis or final states of becoming indicated in the Gita, uttama, madhyama and adhama, highest,
	middle and lowest, offered to the choice of humanity.
	It is for each individual of us to choose.
	For as we choose, God shall fulfil Himself in us, towards a transient human satisfaction, a divine perfection or a
	decomposition of our humanity into the fruitful waste-matter of Nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Every nature, then, is a step towards some super-nature, — towards something natural to itself, but supernatural to
	that which is below.
	Life is supernatural to Matter, Mind supernatural to Life, Ideal Being supernatural to Mind, the Infinite Spirit
	supernatural to ideal being.
	We must, therefore, accept the supernatural as our goal; for the tendency of our nature to the super-nature just
	above it is a command of the World Power to be obeyed and not rebelled against and distrusted.
	It is here that Faith has its importance and Religion, when uncorrupted, its incalculable utility; for our natural
	mind seeks to dwell in its nature and is sceptical of supernature.
	Faith and religion were provisions of the All Wise Energy to accustom the natural and merely mental man to the
	promptings of the ideal soul in him which seeks even now to escape out of twilight into light, out of groping into
	truth, out of the senses and reasoning into vision and direct experience.
	The upward tendency is imposed on us and we cannot permanently resist it; at some time or another God will lay his
	hands on us and force us up that steep incline so difficult to our unregenerate treading.
	For as surely as the animal develops towards humanity and in its most flexible types attains a kind of humanity, as
	surely as the ape and the ant having once appeared, man was bound to follow, so surely man develops towards godhead
	and in his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="42" href="#">3</a> more capable types approaches nearer and nearer towards
	godhead, attains a kind of deity, and so surely the genius and the saint having appeared man is bound to develop in
	himself and out of himself the superman, the siddha purusha.
	For this conclusion no prophetic power or revelation is needed; it is the inevitable corollary from the previous
	demonstrations worked out for us in the vast laboratory of Nature.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 112</p>
<p class="P">
	We have to transcend Nature, to become super-Nature, but it follows from what I have said that it is by taking
	advantage of something still imprisoned in Nature itself, by following some line which Nature is trying to open to
	us that we ought to proceed.
	By yielding to our ordinary nature we fall away both from Nature itself and from God; by transcending Nature we at
	once satisfy her strongest impulse, fulfil all her possibilities and rise towards God.
	The human first touches the divine and then becomes the divine.
	But there are those who seek to kill Nature in order to become the Self.
	Shall we follow them?
	No, however great and lofty be their path, however awful and dazzling their aspiration, because it is not God's<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="43" href="#">4</a> intention in humanity and therefore not our proper dharma.
	Let any say, if he will, that we have made the lower choice.
	We answer in the language of the Gita, Sreyan swadharmo viguno, Better is the law of our own being though inferior,
	too perilous the superior law of another's being.
	To obey God's will in us, is certainly more blissful, perhaps even more divine than to rise to the austere heights
	of the Adwaitin and the ineffable self-extinction in an indefinable Existence.
	For us the embrace of Krishna is enough and the glory of the all-puissant bosom of Kali.
	We have to transcend and possess Nature, not to kill her.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 113</p>
<p class="P">
	In any case, whatever may be the choice for exceptional individuals, it is a general path of supreme attainment for
	humanity that we are seeking, — for I am not proposing to you in Yoga an individual path unconcerned with the rest
	of mankind, — and here there can be no doubt or hesitation.
	Neither the exaggerations of spirituality nor the exaggerations of materialism are our true path.
	Every general movement of our humanity which seeks to deny Nature, however religious, lofty or austere, of whatever
	dazzling purity or ethereality, has been and will always be doomed to failure, sick disappointment, disillusionment
	or perversion, because it is in its nature for the mass of humanity a transient impulse of exaggeration, because it
	contradicts God's condition for us who set Nature there as an indispensable term for His self-fulfilment in the
	universe and ourselves as the supreme instruments and helpers on this earth of that divine self-fulfilment.
	Every movement of humanity which bids us be satisfied with our ordinary Nature, dwell upon the earth, cease to
	aspire to the empyrean within us and choose rather to live like the animals looking to our mortal future before us
	and downwards at the earth we till, not upwards to God and our ungrasped perfection, has been and will always be
	doomed to weariness, petrifaction and cessation or to a quick and violent supernaturalistic reaction, because this
	also is for the mass of men a transient impulse of exaggeration and because it contradicts God's intention in us who
	has entered in and dwells secret in our Nature compelling us towards Him by an obscure, instinctive and
	overmastering attraction.
	Materialistic movements are more unnatural and abnormal than ascetic and negative religions and philosophies; for
	these lead us upward at least, though they go too furiously fast and far for our humanity, but the materialist under
	the pretence of bringing us back to Nature, takes us away from her entirely.
	He forgets or does not see that Nature is only phenomenally Nature, but in reality she is God.
	The divine element in her is that which she most purely and really is; the rest is only term and condition, process
	and stage in her whole progressively developed revelation of the secret divinity.
	He forgets too that Nature is evolving not evolved and what we are now can never be the term of what we shall be
	hereafter.
	The supernatural must be by the very logic of things the end and goal of her movement.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 114</p>
<p class="P">
	Therefore, not to be ensnared, emmeshed and bound by Nature, and not, on the other hand, to be furious with her and
	destroy her, is the first thing we must learn if we are to be complete Yogins and proceed surely towards our divine
	perfection.
	All beings, even the sages, follow after their nature and what shall coercion and torture of it, avail them?
	Prakritim yanti bhutani, nigrahah kim karishyati?
	And it is all so useless!
	Do you feel yourself bound by her and pant for release?
	In her hand alone is the key which shall unlock your fetters.
	Does she stand between you and the Lord?
	She is Sita; pray to her, she will stand aside and show Him to you; but presume not to separate Sita and Rama, to
	cast her out into some distant Lanca under the guard of giant self-tortures so that you may have Rama to yourself in
	Ayodhya.
	Wrestle with Kali, if you will, she loves a good wrestler; but wrestle not with her unlovingly, or in mere disgust
	and hate; for her displeasure is terrible and though she loves the Asuras, she destroys them.
	Rather go through her and under her protection, go with a right understanding of her and with a true and unfaltering
	Will; she will lead you on with whatever circlings, yet surely and in the wisest way, to the All-Blissful
	Personality and the Ineffable Presence.
	Nature is the Power of God Himself, leading these multitudes of beings, through the night and the desert and the
	tracts of the foeman to their secret and promised heritage.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Supernature, then, is in every way our aim in Yoga; being still natural to the world, to transcend Nature internally
	so that both internally and externally we may possess and enjoy her as free and lord, swarat and samrat; being still
	the symbol in a world of symbol-beings, to reach through it to that which is symbolised, to realise the symbol;
	being still a figure of humanity, a man among men, a living body among living bodies, manus, mental beings housed in
	that living matter among other embodied mental beings; being and remaining in our outward parts all this that we are
	apparently, yet to exceed it and become in the body what we are really in the secret self, — God, spirit, supreme
	and infinite being, pure Bliss of divine joy, pure Force of divine action, pure Light of divine knowledge.
	Our whole apparent life has only a symbolic value and is good and necessary as a becoming; but all becoming has
	being for its goal and fulfilment and God is the only being.
	To become divine in the nature of the world and in the symbol of humanity is the perfection for which we were
	created.

	The Fullness of Yoga — In Condition

<p class="pg-num">Page 115</p>
<p class="P">
	We are to exceed our human stature and become divine; but if we are to do this, we must first get God; for
	the human ego is the lower imperfect term of our being, God is the higher perfect term.
	He is the possessor of our supernature and without His permission there can be no effectual rising.
	The finite cannot become infinite unless it perceives its own secret infinity and is drawn by it or towards it; nor
	can the symbol-being, unless it glimpses, loves and pursues the Real-being in itself, overcome by its own strength
	the limits of its apparent nature.
	It is a particular becoming and is fixed in the nature of the symbol that it has become; only the touch of that
	which is all becomings and exceeds all becomings, can liberate it from the bondage to its own limited Nature.
	God is That which is the All and which exceeds the All.
	It is therefore only the knowledge, love and possession of God that can make us free.
	He who is transcendent, can alone enable us to transcend ourselves; He who is universal can alone enlarge us from
	our limited particular existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 116</p>
<p class="P">
	In this necessity is the justification of that great and imperishable force of Nature, which Rationalism has
	unjustly and irrationally despised, Religion.
	I speak of religion, — not of a creed, church or theology, for all these things are rather forms of religiosity than
	essence or even always action of religion, — but of that personal and intimate religion, a thing of temper and
	spirit and life, not of views and formal actions, which draws a man passionately and absorbingly to his own vision
	of the Supreme or his own idea of something higher than himself which he must follow or become.
	Without a fervent worship of the Supreme in the heart, a strong aspiration upwards to It in the will or a vehement
	thirst for it in the temperament, we cannot have the impulse to be other than ourselves or the force to do anything
	so difficult as the transcending of our own ingrained and possessing human nature.
	The prophets have spoken and the Avatars have descended always for the one purpose, to call us to God, to inspire us
	to this great call on our upward straining energies or else to prepare something in the world which will help to
	bring humanity nearer to the goal of its difficult ascending journey.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It may seem at first sight that there is no need for these religious terms or this religious spirit.
	If the aim is to become something superior to man, to evolve a superman out of ourselves, as man has been evolved
	out of the ape, — if that statement of the progression be indeed the truth, — the ape out of inferior animal forms,
	they again out of mollusc and protoplasm, jellyfish or vegetable animals, and so to the end of the series, then what
	need is there of anything but the training, preferably the most intelligent and scientific training of our mental,
	moral and physical energies till they reach a point when they are transmuted by the psychical chemistry of Nature
	into the coming superior type?
	But the problem is not so simple, in reality.
	There are three errors hidden at the basis of this sceptical question.
	We mistake the nature of the operation to be effected, we mistake the nature of the power and process that works it
	out, we mistake the nature of the thing that uses the power and works out the process.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 117</p>
<p class="P">
	Nature does not propose to man to work out a higher mental, moral and physical variation-type in the mould of the
	present human being, — the symbol we are; it proposes to break that general type altogether in order to advance to a
	new symbol-being which shall be supernatural to present man as present man is to the animal below him.
	It is doubtful whether in the pure human mould Nature can go much farther than she has gone at present; that she can
	for instance produce a higher mental type than Newton, Shakespeare, Caesar or Napoleon, a higher moral type than
	Buddha, Christ or St Francis, a higher physical type than the Greek athlete or to give modern examples, a Sandow or
	a Ramamurti.
	She may seek to bring about a better combination of mental and moral, or of moral, mental and physical energies; but
	is she likely to produce anything much above the level of Confucius or Socrates?
	It is more probable and seems to be true that Nature seeks in this field to generalise a higher level and a better
	combination.
	Neither need we believe that, even here, her object is to bring all men to the same level; for that can only be done
	by levelling downwards.
	Nothing in Nature is free from inequalities except the forms that are the lowest and least developed.
	The higher the effort accomplished, the more richly endowed the organism of the species, the greater the chances of
	inequality.
	In so high and developed a natural movement as Man, equality of individual opportunity is conceivable, equality of
	natural powers and accomplishment is a chimera.
	Nor will the generalisation of powers or the increase of material make any difference to the level of natural
	attainment.
	All the accumulated discoveries and varied information of the modern scientist will not make him mentally the
	superior of Aristotle or Socrates; he is neither an acuter mind nor a greater mental force.
	All the varied activities of modern philanthropy will not produce a greater moral type than Buddha or St Francis.
	The invention of the motor car will not make up for the lost swiftness and endurance nor gymnastics restore the
	physical capacity of the Negro<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="44" href="#">1</a> or the American Indian.
	We see therefore the limits of Nature's possibilities in the human symbol, fixed by the character of the symbol
	itself and recognised by her in her strivings.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 118</p>
<p class="P">
	It is still a question whether in these limits the chief preoccupation of Nature is the exhaustion of the
	possibilities of the human symbol.
	That is rather man's preoccupation and therefore the direction she takes when human intellect interferes with her
	normal progression.
	Left to herself and even utilising human interferences, she seems bent rather on breaking the mould, than on
	perfecting it, — only indeed in her more advanced individuals and more daring movements and with due regard to the
	safety of the general human type, but this is always her method when she wishes to advance to a fresh symbol without
	destroying the anterior species.
	The more civilised man becomes, the more she plagues him with moral abnormalities, excesses of vice and virtue and
	confusions of the very type of vice and virtue; the more he intellectualises, the more he insists on rationality as
	his utmost bourne, the more she becomes dissatisfied and clamours to him to develop rather his instincts and his
	intuitions; the more he strives after health and hygiene, the more she multiplies diseases and insanities of mind
	and body.
	He has triumphed over super naturalism, he has chained her down to the material, human and rational; immediately she
	breaks out fiercely into unthought-of revivals and gigantic supernaturalisms.
	Whatever work she is intent on, she will not be baulked in that work by the limited human reason.
	Through all her vast being she feels the pulsation of a supernatural power, the workings and strivings of a
	knowledge superior to material reason.
	She breaks out, therefore, she compels, she insists.
	Everywhere we see her striving to break the mental, moral and physical type she has created and to get beyond it to
	some new processes as yet not clearly discerned.
	She attacks deliberately the sound healthfulness and equilibrium of our normal type of intellectuality, morality and
	physical being.
	She is stricken also with a mania of colossalism; colossal structures, colossal combinations, colossal heights and
	speeds, colossal dreams and ambitions outline themselves everywhere more or less clearly, more or less dimly.
	Unable as yet to do her will in the individual, she works with masses; unable in the mind, with material forms and
	inventions; unable in actualities, with hopes and dreams; unable to reproduce or produce Napoleons and
	super-Napoleons, she generalises a greater reach of human capacity from which they may hereafter emerge more easily,
	and meanwhile she creates instead Dreadnoughts and Super-dreadnoughts, Trusts and mammoth combines, teems with
	distance destroying inventions and seems eager and furious to trample to pieces the limitations of space and time
	she herself has created.

	As if to point her finger to the thing she intends, she has accumulated the signs of this process of breaking and
	rebuilding in the phenomena of genius.
	It is now common knowledge that genius hardly appears in the human species unattended, unprepared or unaccompanied
	by abnormalities in the individual body, vitality and mind which contains it, — degeneration, insanity or freak in
	the heredity which produces it and even disturbance and supra normality in the human environment in which it occurs.
	The haste of a brilliant generalisation establishes on this basis the paradox that genius itself is a morbid
	phenomenon of insanity or degeneration.
	The true explanation is sufficiently clear.
	In order to establish genius in the human system, Nature is compelled to disturb and partially break the normality
	of that system, because she is introducing into it an element that is alien as it is superior to the type which it
	enriches.
	Genius is not the perfect evolution of that new and divine element; it is only a beginning or at the highest an
	approximation in certain directions.
	It works fitfully and uncertainly in the midst of an enormous mass of somewhat disordered human mentality, vital
	nervosity, physical animality.
	The thing itself is divine, it is only the undivine mould in which it works that is to a lesser or greater extent
	broken and ploughed up by the unassimilated force that works in it.
	Sometimes there is an element in the divine intruder which lays its hand on the mould and sustains it, so that it
	does not break at all, nor is flawed; or if there is a disturbance, it is slight and negligible.
	Such an element there was in Caesar, in Shakespeare, in Goethe.
	Sometimes also a force appears to which we can no longer apply the description of genius without being hopelessly
	inadequate in our terminology.
	Then those who have eyes to see, bow down and confess the Avatar.
	For it is often the work of the Avatar to typify already, partly or on the whole, what Nature has not yet effected
	in the mass or even in the individual, so that his passing may stamp it on the material ether in which we live.

<p class="P">
	But what is this type of which the great Mother is in labour?
	What birth will emerge from the cries and throes of this prolonged and mighty pregnancy?
	A greater type of humanity, it may be said.
	But in order to understand what we are saying, we must first see clearly what the humanity is which she seeks to
	surpass.
	This human symbol, this type we now are is a mental being with a mental ego, working in a vital case by mind always,
	but upon matter, in matter and through matter.
	It is limited in its higher workings by its lower instruments.
	Its basis of mind is egoistic, sensational and determined by experience and environment, its knowledge therefore
	pursues wider or narrower circles in a fixed and meagre range.
	Its moral temperament and action is similarly egoistic, sensational, experiential and determined by environment; for
	this reason it is bound equally to sin and virtue and all attempts radically to moralise the race within the limits
	of its egoistic nature have been and must necessarily, in spite of particular modifications, end in general failure.
	It is not only a mixed but a confused type, body and vitality interfering with mind and mind both hampered by and
	hampering body and vitality.
	Its search for knowledge, founded on sense contact, is a groping like that of a man finding his way in a forest at
	night; it makes acquaintance with its surroundings by touching, dashing on or stumbling over them; and, although it
	has an uncertain light of reason given it which partially corrects this disability, yet since reason has also to
	start from the senses which are consistent falsifiers of values, rational knowledge is not only restricted but
	pursued by vast dimnesses and uncertainties even in that which it seems to itself to have grasped.
	It secures a few flowers of truth by rummaging in a thorny hedge of doubts and errors.
	The actions of the type also are a breaking through thickets, a sanguine yet tormented stumbling forward through
	eager failures to partial and temporary successes.
	Immensely superior to all else that Nature had yet effected, this type is yet so burdened with disabilities, that,
	if it were impossible to break its mould and go forward, there would be much justification for those pessimistic
	philosophies which despair of Life and see in the Will not to Live humanity's only door of escape admitting to it no
	other salvation.
	But Nature is the will of the all-Wise God and she is not working out a reduction of the world to absurdity.
	She knows her goal, she knows that man as he is at present is only a transitional type; and so far as she can
	consistently with the survival of the type, she presses forward to what she has seen in God's eternal knowledge as
	standing beyond.
	From this ego, she moves towards a universal consciousness, from this limitation to a free movement in infinity,
	from this twilit and groping mind to the direct sunlit vision of things, from this conflict without issue between
	vice and virtue to a walking that keeps spontaneously to a God-appointed path, from this broken and grief-besieged
	action to a joyous and free activity, from this confused strife of our members to a purified, unentangled and
	harmonious combination, from this materialised mentality to an idealised and illuminated life, body and mind, from
	the symbol to reality, from man separated from God to man in God and God in man.
	In brief, as she has aspired successfully from matter to life, from life to mind and mental ego, so she aspires and
	with a fated success to an element beyond mind, the vijnana of the Hindus, the self-luminous idea or Truth-self now
	concealed and superconscious in man and the world, as life was always concealed in matter and mind in life.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="45" href="#">2</a>
	What this vijnana is, we have yet to see, but through it she knows she can lay firm hold on that highest term of all
	which is the reality of all symbols, in Spirit, in Sachchidananda.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The aim of Nature is also the aim of Yoga.
	Yoga, like Nature at its summit, seeks to break this mould of ego, this mould of mentalised life body and
	materialised mind, in order to achieve ideal action, ideal truth and infinite freedom in our spiritual being.
	To effect so enormous an end great and dangerous processes have to be used.
	Those who have been eager on this road or have opened up new paths towards the goal, have had to affront as a
	possibility frequently realised loss of reason, loss of life and health or dissolution of the moral being.
	They are not to be pitied or scorned even when they succumb; rather are they martyrs for humanity's progress, far
	more than the lost navigator or the scientist slain by the dangers of his investigation.
	They prepare consciently the highest possible achievement towards which the rest of humanity instinctively and
	unconsciously moves.
	We may even say that Yoga is the appointed means Nature holds in reserve for the accomplishment of her end, when she
	has finished her long labour of evolving at least a part of humanity temperamentally equal to the effort and
	intellectually, morally and physically prepared for success.
	Nature moves toward supernature, Yoga moves towards God; the world-impulse and the human aspiration are one movement
	and the same journey.</p>

<p class="P">
	If this is the nature of the operation to be effected, not a perfection of the present human mould but a
	breaking of it to proceed to a higher type, what then is the power and process that works it out?
	What is this Nature of which we speak so fluently?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46" href="#">1</a>
	We habitually talk of it as if it were something mighty and conscious that lives and plans; we credit it with an
	aim, with wisdom to pursue that aim and with power to effect what it pursues.
	Are we justified in our language by the actualities of the universe or is this merely our inveterate habit of
	applying human figures to non-human things<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="47" href="#">2</a> and the workings of
	intelligence to non-intelligent processes which come right because they must and not because they will and produce
	this magnificent ordered universe by some dumb blind and brute necessity inconceivable in its origin and nature to
	intelligent beings?
	If so, this blind brute force has produced something higher than itself, something which did not exist preconceived
	in its bosom or in any way belong to it.
	We cannot understand what being and Nature are, not because we are as yet too small and limited, but because we are
	too much above being and Nature.
	Our intelligence is a luminous freak in a darkness from which it was impossibly produced, since nothing in that
	darkness justified itself as a cause of its creation.
	Unless mind was inherent in brute matter, — and in that case matter is only apparently brute, — it was impossible
	for matter to produce mind.
	But since this leads us to an impossibility, it cannot be the truth.
	We must suppose then, if matter is brute, that mind is also brute.
	Intelligence is an illusion; there is nothing but a shock of material impacts creating vibrations and reactions of
	matter which translate themselves into the phenomena of intelligence.
	Knowledge is only a relation of matter with matter, and is intrinsically neither different nor superior to the
	hurtling of atoms against each other or the physical collision of two bulls in a meadow.
	The material agents involved and phenomenon produced are different and therefore we do not call the recoil of one
	horned forehead from another an act of knowledge or intelligence, but the thing that has happened is intrinsically
	the same.
	Intelligence is itself inert and mechanical and merely the physiological result of a physiological movement and has
	nothing in it psychical or mental in the time-honoured sense of the words soul and mind.
	This is the view of modern scientific rationalism, — put indeed in other language than the scientist's, put so as to
	bring out its logical consequences and implications, but still effectively the modern account of the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In that account the nature of a thing consists of its composition, the properties contained in that composition and
	the laws of working determined by those properties; as for [example] iron is composed of certain elementary
	substances, possesses as a consequence of its composition certain properties, such as hardness etc. and under given
	circumstances will act in a given manner as the result of its properties.
	Applying this analysis on a larger scale we see the universe as the composition of certain brute forces working in
	certain material substances, possessed in itself and in those substances of certain primary and secondary, general
	and particular properties and working as a result by certain invariable tendencies and fixed processes which we call
	by a human figure Nature's Laws.
	This is Nature.
	When searchingly analysed she is found to be a play of two entities, Force and Matter; but these two, if the
	unitarian view of the universe is correct, will some day be proved to be only one entity, either only Matter or only
	Force.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 124</p>
<p class="P">
	Even if we accept this modern view of the universe, which, it is not at all dangerous to prophesy, will have
	disappeared in the course of a century into a larger synthesis, there is still something to be said about the
	presence or absence of intelligence in Nature.
	In what after all does intelligence consist, what are its composition, properties, laws?
	What in its circumstances is human intelligence, the only kind of intelligence which we are in a position to study
	from within and therefore understand?
	It is marked by three qualities or processes, the power and process of adaptation towards an end, the power and
	process of discrimination between the impacts on its senses and the power and process of mentally conscious
	comprehension.
	Human intelligence is, to put it briefly, ideological, discriminative and mentally conscious.
	About other than human beings, about animals, trees, metals, forces, we can say nothing from inside, we can only
	infer the absence or presence of these elements of consciousness from the evidence collected by an external
	observation.
	We cannot positively say, having no internal evidence, that the tree is not a mind imprisoned in matter and unable
	to express itself in the media it has at its disposal; we cannot say that it does not suffer the reactions of
	pleasure and pain; but from the external evidence we infer to the contrary.
	Our negative conclusion is probable, it is not certain.
	It may be itself negatived in the future march of knowledge.
	But still, taking the evidence as it stands, what are the facts we actually arrive at in this comparison of
	intelligent and non-intelligent Nature?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 125</p>
<p class="P">
	First, Nature possesses in a far higher degree than man the teleological faculty and process.
	To place an aim before one, to combine, adapt, modify, unify, vary means and processes in order to attain that end,
	to struggle against and overcome difficulties, to devise means to circumvent difficulties when they cannot be
	overcome, this is one of the noblest and divinest parts of human intelligence.
	But its action in man is only a speciality of its universal action in Nature.
	She works it out in man partly through the reason, in animals with very little and rudimentary reason, mainly
	through instinct, memory, impulse and sensation, in plants and other objects with very little and rudimentary
	reason, mainly through impulse and mechanical or, as we call it, involuntary action.
	But throughout there is the end and the adaptation to the end, and throughout the same basic means are used; for in
	man also it is only for a selection of his ends and processes that the reason is used; for the greater part she uses
	the animal means, memory, impulse, sensation, instinct, — instincts differently directed, less decisive and more
	general than the animal instincts but still in the end and for their purpose as sure; and for yet another part she
	uses the same merely mechanical impulse and involuntary action precisely as in her mistermed inanimate forms of
	existence.
	Let us not say that the prodigality of Nature, her squandering of materials, her frequent failure, her apparent
	freaks and gam-boilings are signs of purposelessness and absence of intelligence.
	Man with his reason is guilty of the same laches and wanderings.
	But neither Man nor Nature is therefore purposeless or unintelligent.
	It is Nature who compels Man himself to be other than too strenuously utilitarian, for she knows better than the
	economist and the utilitarian philosopher.
	She is an universal intelligence and she has to attend, not only in the sum, but in each detail, to the universal as
	well as to the particular effect; she has to work out each detail with her eye on the group and not only on the
	group but the whole kind and not only on the whole kind but the whole world of species.
	Man, a particular intelligence limited by his reason, is incapable of this largeness; he puts his particular ends in
	the forefront and neither sees where absorption in them hurts his general well being nor can divine where they clash
	with the universal purpose.
	Her failures have an utility — we shall see before long how great an utility; her freaks have a hidden seriousness.
	And yet above all she remembers that beyond all formal ends, her one great object is the working out of universal
	delight founded on arrangement as a means, but exceeding its means.
	Towards that she moves; she takes delight on the way, she takes delight in the work, she takes delight, too, beyond
	the work.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 126</p>
<p class="P">
	But in all this we anticipate, we speak as if Nature were self-conscious; what we have arrived at is that Nature is
	teleological, more widely than man, more perfectly than man, and man himself is only teleological because of that in
	Nature and by the same elementary means and processes as the animal and the plant, though with additions of fresh
	means peculiar to mind.
	This, it may be said, does not constitute Intelligence, — for intelligence is not only teleological, but
	discriminative and mentally conscious.
	Mechanical discrimination, Nature certainly possesses in the highest degree; without it her teleological processes
	would be impossible.
	The tendril growing straight through the air comes into contact with a rope, a stick, the stalk of a plant;
	immediately it seizes it as with a finger, changes its straight growth for a curled and compressive movement, and
	winds itself round and round the support.
	What induces the change? what makes it discriminate the presence of a support and the possibility of this new
	movement?
	It is the instinct of the tendril and differs in no way, intrinsically, from the instinct of the newborn pup seizing
	at once on its mother's teats or the instinct of a man in his more mechanical needs and actions.
	We see the moon-lotus open its petals to the moon, close them to the touch of the day.
	In what does this discriminative movement differ from the motion of the hand leaping back from the touch of a flame,
	or from the recoiling movement of disgust and displeasure in the nerves from an abhorrent sight or from the
	recoiling movement of denial and uncongeniality in the mind from a distasteful idea or opinion?
	Intrinsically, there seems to be no difference; but there is a difference in circumstance.
	One is not attended with mental self-consciousness, the others are attended with this supremely important element.
	We think falsely that there is no will in the action of the tendril and the lotus, and no discrimination.
	There is a will, but not mentalised will; there is discrimination but not mentalised discrimination.
	It is mechanical, we say, — but do we understand what we mean when we say it, — and we give other names, calling
	will force, discrimination a natural reaction or an organic tendency.
	These names are only various masks concealing an intrinsic identity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 127</p>
<p class="P">
	Even if we could go no farther, we should have gained an enormous step; for we have already the conception of the
	thing we call Nature as possessing, containing or identical with a great Force of Will placing before itself a vast
	end and a million complexly related incidental ends, working them out by contrivance, adaptation, arrangement,
	device, using an unfailing discrimination and vastly fulfilling its complex work.
	Of this great Force human intelligence would only be a limited and inferior movement, guided and used by it, serving
	its ends even when it seems to combat its ends.
	We may deny Intelligence to such a Power, because it does not give signs of mental consciousness and does not in
	every part of its works use a human or mental intelligence; but our objection is only a metaphysical distinction.
	Practically, looking out on life and not in upon abstract thought, we can, if we admit this conception, rely on it
	that the workings of this unintelligent discrimination will be the same as if they were the workings of a universal
	Intelligence and
	the aim<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="48" href="#">3</a> and means of the mechanical will the aims and means which would
	be chosen by an Almighty Wisdom.
	But if we arrive at this certainty, does not Reason itself demand of us that we should admit in Nature or behind it
	a universal Intelligence and an Almighty Wisdom?
	If the results are such as these powers would create, must we not admit the presence of these powers as the cause?
	Which is the truer Rationalism, to admit that the works of Intelligence are produced by Intelligence or to assert
	that they are produced by a blind Machine unconsciously working out perfection? to admit that the emergence of overt
	intelligence in humanity is due to the specialised function of a secret intelligence in the universe or to assert
	that it is the product of a Force to which the very principle of Intelligence is absent?
	To justify the paradox by saying that things are worked out in a particular way because it is their nature to be
	worked out in that way, is to play the fool with reason; for it does not carry us an inch beyond the mere fact that
	they are so worked out, one knows not why.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 128</p>
<p class="P">
	The true reason for the modern reluctance to admit that Nature has intelligence and wisdom or is intelligence and
	wisdom, is the constant association in the human mind of these things with mentally self-conscious personality.
	Intelligence, we think, presupposes someone who is intelligent, an ego who possesses and uses this intelligence.
	An examination of human consciousness shows that this association is an error.
	Intelligence possesses us, not we intelligence; intelligence uses us, not we intelligence.
	The mental ego in man is a creation and instrument of intelligence and intelligence itself is a force of Nature
	manifesting itself in a rudimentary or advanced state in all animal life.
	This objection, therefore, vanishes.
	Not only so, but Science herself by putting the ego in its right place as a product of mind has shown that
	Intelligence is not a human possession but a force of Nature and therefore an attribute of Nature, a manifestation
	of the universal Force.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 129</p>
<p class="P">
	The question remains, is it a fundamental and omnipresent attribute or only a development manifested in a select
	minority of her works?
	Here again, the difficulty is that we associate intelligence with an organised mental consciousness.
	But let us look at and interrogate the facts which Science has brought into our ken.
	We will glance at only one of them, the fly catching plant of America.
	Here is a vegetable organism which has hunger, — shall we say, an unconscious hunger, which needs animal food, which
	sets a trap for it, as the spider sets<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="49" href="#">4</a> it, which feels the moment the
	victim touches the trap, which immediately closes and seizes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="50" href="#">5</a> the prey,
	eats and digests it and lies in wait for more.
	These motions are exactly the motions of the spider's mental intelligence altered and conditioned only by the
	comparative immobility of the plant and confined only, so far as we can observe, to the management of this supreme
	vital need and its satisfaction.
	Why should we attribute mental intelligence to the spider and none to the plant?
	Granted that it is rudimentary, organised only for special purposes, still it would seem to be the same natural
	Force at work in the spider and plant, intelligently devising means to an end and superintending the conduct of the
	device.
	If there is no mind in the plant, then, irresistibly, mental intelligence and mechanical intelligence are one and
	the same thing in essence, and the tendril embracing its prop, the plant catching its prey and the spider seizing
	its victim are all forms of one Force of action, which we may decline to call Intelligence if we will, but which is
	obviously the same thing as Intelligence.
	The difference is between Intelligence organised as mind, and Intelligence not organised but working with a broad
	elementary purity more unerring, in a way, than the action of mind.
	In the light of these facts the conception of Nature as infinite teleological and discriminative Force of
	Intelligence unorganised and impersonal because superior to organisation and personality becomes the supreme
	probability, the mechanical theory is only a possibility.
	In the absence of certainties Reason demands that we should accept the probable in preference to the possible and a
	harmonious and natural in preference to a violent and paradoxical explanation.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 130</p>
<p class="P">
	But is it certain that in this Intelligence and its works Mind is a speciality and Personality — as distinguished
	from mental ego — is entirely absent except as an efflorescence and convenience of Mind?
	We think so, because we suppose that where there are no animal signs of consciousness, there consciousness cannot
	and does not exist.
	This also may be an assumption.
	We must remember that we know nothing of the tree and the stone except its exterior signs of life or quiescence; our
	internal knowledge is confined to the phenomena of human psychology.
	But even in this limited sphere there is much that should make us think very deeply and pause very long before we
	hasten to rash negative assertions.
	A man sleeps, dreamlessly, he thinks; but we know that all the time consciousness is at work within him, dreaming,
	always dreaming; of his body and its surroundings he knows nothing, yet that body is of itself conducting all the
	necessary operations of life.
	In the man stunned or in trance there is the same phenomenon of a divided being, consciousness mentally active
	within apart from the body which is mentally even as the tree and the stone, but vitally active and functioning like
	the tree.
	Catalepsy presents a still more curious phenomenon<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="51" href="#">6</a> of a body dead and
	inert like the stone, not even vitally active like the tree, but a mind perfectly aware of itself, its medium and
	its surroundings, though no longer in active possession of the medium and therefore no longer able to act materially
	on its surroundings.
	In face of these examples how can we assert that there is no life in the stone, no mind in stone or tree?
	The premise of the syllogism by which science denies mind to the tree or life to the stone, viz that where there is
	no outward sign of life or conscious mentality, life and mentality do not exist, is proven to be false.
	The possibility, even a certain probability presents itself, — in view of the unity of Nature and the omnipresent
	intelligence in her works, that the tree and the stone are in their totality just such a divided being, a form not
	yet penetrated and possessed by conscious mind, a conscious intelligence within dreaming in itself or, like the
	cataleptic, aware of its surroundings, but because not yet possessed of its medium (the intelligence in the
	cataleptic is temporarily dispossessed) unable to show any sign of life or of mentality or to act aggressively on
	its surroundings.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We do not need to stop at this imperfect probability, for the latest researches of psychology make it almost
	overwhelming in its insistence and next door to the actual proof.
	We now know that within men there is a dream self or sleep self other than the waking consciousness, active in the
	stunned, the drugged, the hypnotised, the sleeping, which knows what the waking mind does not know, understands what
	the waking mind does not understand, remembers accurately what the waking mind has not even taken the trouble to
	notice.
	Who is this apparent sleeper in the waking, this waker in the sleeping in comparison with whose comprehensive
	attentiveness and perfect observation, memory and intelligence our waking consciousness is only a fragmentary and
	hasty dream?
	Mark this capital point that this more perfect consciousness within us is not the product of evolution, — nowhere in
	the evolved and waking world is there such a being who remembers and repeats automatically the sounds of a foreign
	language which is unnoticed jabbering to the instructed mind, solves spontaneously problems from which the
	instructed mind has retired baffled and weary, notices everything, understands everything, recalls everything.
	Therefore this consciousness within is independent of evolution and, consequently, we may presume, anterior to
	evolution.
	Esha supteshu jagarti, says the Katha Upanishad,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="52" href="#">7</a> This is the Waker in
	all who sleep.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 131</p>
<p class="P">
	This new psychological research is only in its infancy and cannot tell us what this secret consciousness is, but the
	knowledge gained by Yoga enables us to assert positively that this is the complete mental being within who guides
	life and body, manomayah pranashariraneta.
	He it is who conducts our evolution and awakes mind out of life and is more and more getting possession of this
	vitalised human body, his medium and instrument, so that it may become what it is not now, a perfect instrument of
	mentality.
	In the stone he also is and in the tree, in those sleepers also there is one who wakes; but he has not in those
	forms got possession yet of the instrument for the purposes of mind; he can only use them for the purposes of
	vitality in its growth or in its active functioning.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We see, therefore, modern psychology, although it still gets away from the only rational and logical conclusion
	possible on its data, marching inevitably and under the sheer compulsion of facts to the very truths arrived at
	thousands of years ago by the ancient Rishis.
	How did they arrive at them?
	Not by speculation, as the scholars vainly imagine, but by Yoga.
	For the great stumbling block that has stood in the way of Science is its inability to get inside its object, the
	necessity under which it labours of building on inferences from external study, — and all its desperate and cruel
	attempts to make up the deficiency by vivisection or other ruthless experiments cannot remedy the defect.
	Yoga enables us to get inside the object by dissolving the artificial barriers of the bodily experience and the
	mental ego-sense in the observer.
	It takes us out of the little hold of personal experience and casts us into the great universal currents; takes us
	out of the personal mind sheath and makes [us] one with universal self and universal mind.
	Therefore were the ancient Rishis able to see what now we are beginning again to glimpse dimly that not only is
	Nature herself an infinite teleological and discriminative impersonal Force of Intelligence or Consciousness, prajna

	Maya
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 134132</p>
<p class="P">
	The world exists as symbol of Brahman; but the mind creates or accepts false values of things and takes
	symbol for essential reality.
	This is ignorance or cosmic illusion, the mistake of the mind and senses, from which the Magician Himself, Master of
	the Illusion, is calling on us to escape.
	This false valuation of the world is the Maya of the Gita and can be surmounted without abandoning either action or
	world-existence.
	But in addition, the whole of universal existence is in this sense an illusion of Maya that it is not an unchanging
	transcendent and final reality of things but only a symbolical reality; it is a valuation of the reality of Brahman
	in the terms of cosmic consciousness.
	All these objects we see or are mentally aware of as objectively existing, are only forms of consciousness.
	They are the thing-in-itself turned first into terms and ideas born of a movement or rhythmic process of
	consciousness and then objectivised, in consciousness itself and not really external to it.
	They have therefore a fixed conventional reality, but not an eternally durable essential reality; they are symbols,
	not altogether the thing symbolised, means of knowledge, not altogether the thing known.
	To look at it from another point of view Existence or Brahman has two fundamental states of consciousness, cosmic
	consciousness and transcendental consciousness.
	To cosmic consciousness the world is real as a direct first term expressing the inexpressible; to transcendental
	consciousness the world is only a secondary and indirect term expressing the inexpressible.
	When I have the cosmic consciousness, I see the world as my Self manifested; in transcendental consciousness I see
	the world not as the manifestation of my Self but as a manifestation of something I choose to be to my
	Self-consciousness.
	It is a conventional term expressing me which does not bind me; I could dissolve it and express myself otherwise.
	It is a vocable of a particular language expressing something in speech or writing which could be equally well
	expressed by quite another vocable in another language.
	I say tiger in English; I might equally have spoken Sanscrit and used the word shardula; it would have made no
	difference to the tiger or to myself, but only to my play with the symbols of speech and thought.
	So it is with Brahman and the universe, the Thing in itself and its symbols with their fixed conventional values,
	some of which are relative to the general consciousness and some to the individual consciousness of the
	symbol-being.
	Matter, Mind, Life for instance are general symbols with a fixed general value to God in His cosmic consciousness;
	but they have a different individual value, make a different impression or represent themselves differently, as we
	say, to myself, to the ant or to the god and angel.
	This perception of the purely conventional value of form and name in the Universe is expressed in metaphysics by the
	formula that the world is a creation of Para Maya or supreme Cosmic Illusion.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It does not follow that the world is unreal or has no existence worth the name.
	None of the ancient Scriptures of Hinduism affirms the unreality of the world, nor is it a logical consequence of
	the great but remote and difficult truth words are so inadequate to express.
	We must remember that all these terms, Maya, illusion, dream, unreality, relative reality, conventional value, are
	merely verbal figures and must not be pressed with a too literal scholastic or logical insistence.
	They are like the paint-brush hurled by the painter at his picture in desperation at not arriving at the effect he
	wanted; they are stones thrown at the truth, not the truth itself.
	We shall see this clearly enough when we come to look at the Cosmos from quite another standpoint, — the standpoint
	not of Maya, but Lila.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="54" href="#">1</a>
	But certain great metaphysical minds, not perceiving sufficiently that words like everything else have only
	conventional values and are symbols of a truth which is in itself inexpressible, have drawn from the ideas suggested
	by these words, the most rigorous and concrete conclusions.
	They have condemned the whole world as a miserable and lying dream, all the more hateful and profitless for a
	certain element of ineffugable reality which the more clearsighted part of their minds was<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">2</a> compelled to realise and partially to admit.
	The truth in their premises has made their doctrines a mighty instrument for the liberation of great and austere
	souls, the error in their conclusion has afflicted humanity with the vain and barren gospel of the vanity not only
	of false mundane existence, but of all mundane existence.
	In the extreme forms of this view both nature and supernature, man and God are lies of consciousness, myths of a
	cosmic dream and not worth accepting.
	Amelioration is a chimera, divinity a lure and only absorption in a transmundane impersonal existence worth
	pursuing.
	The worshippers of God, the seekers after human perfection, those who would raise humanity from nature to
	supernature, find in their path two great stumbling blocks, on one side, the lower trend of Nature to persist in its
	past gains which represents itself in the besotted naturalism of the practical man and the worldling and on the
	other, this grand overshooting of the mark represented not only by the world-fleeing ascetic, who is after all,
	within his rights, but by the depressing pessimism of the ignorant who mean neither to flee the world, nor, if they
	did, could rise to the real grandeur of asceticism, but are still imbued intellectually and overshadowed in
	temperament by these high and fatal doctrines.
	A better day will dawn for India when the shadow is lifted and the Indian mental consciousness without renouncing
	the truth of Maya, perceives that it is only a partial explanation of existence.
	Mundane existence is not indispensable either to God's being or to God's bliss, but it is not therefore a vanity;
	nor is a liberated mundane existence — liberated in God — either a vain or a false existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 137136</p>
<p class="P">
	The ordinary doctrine of Maya is not a simple truth, but proceeds upon three distinct spiritual perceptions.
	The first and highest is this supreme perception that the world is a mass of consciousness-symbols, having a
	conventional value, beings exist only in Brahman's self-consciousness and individual personality and ego-sense are
	only symbols and terms in the universal symbol-existence.
	We have said that and we shall see that we are not compelled by this perception to set down the world as a myth or a
	valueless convention.
	Nor would the Mayavadin himself have been brought to this extreme conclusion if he had not brought into the purity
	of this highest soul-experience his two other perceptions.
	The second of these, the lowest, is the perception of the lower or Apara Maya which I have indicated in the opening
	of this essay — the perception of the system of false values put by mind and sense on the symbol facts of the
	universe.
	At a certain stage of our mental culture it is easy to see that the senses are deceiving guides, all mental opinions
	and judgments uncertain, partial and haunted and pursued by doubt, the world not a reality in the sense in which the
	mind takes it for a reality, in the sense in which the senses only occupied by and only careful of the practical
	values of things, their vyavaharic artha, deal with it as a reality.
	Reaching this stage the mind arrives at this perception that all its values for the world being false, perhaps it is
	because there is no true value or only a true value not conceivable to the mind, and from this idea it is easy for
	our impatient human nature to stride to the conclusion that so it is and all existence or all world-existence at
	least is illusory, a sensation born of nothingness, a play of zeros.
	Hence Buddhism, the sensational Agnostic philosophies, Mayavada.
	Again, it is easy at a certain stage of moral culture to perceive that the moral values put by the emotions,
	passions and aspirations on actions and experiences are false values, that the objects of our sins are not worth
	sinning for and even that our principles and values do not stand in the shock of the world's actualities, but are,
	they too, conventional values which we do not find to be binding on the great march of Nature.
	From this it is natural and right to come to vairagya or dissatisfaction with a life of false valuations and very
	easy to stride forward, again in the impatience of our imperfect human nature, to the consummation of an entire
	vairagya, not only dissatisfaction with a false moral life, but disgust with life of any sort and the conclusion of
	the vanity of world-existence.
	We have a mental vairagya, a moral vairagya and to these powerful motives is added in the greater types the most
	powerful of all, spiritual vairagya.
	For at a certain stage of spiritual culture we come to the perception of the world as a system of mere consciousness
	values in Parabrahman or to a middle term, the experience, which was probably the decisive factor in the minds of
	great spiritual seekers like Shankara, of the pure and bright impersonal Sachchidananda beyond, unaffected by and
	apparently remote from all cosmic existence.
	Observing intellectually through the mind this great experience, the conclusion is natural and almost inevitable
	that this Pure and Bright One regards the universe as a mirage, an unreality, a dream.
	But these are only the terms, the word-values and conventional idea-values into which mind then translates this fact
	of unaffected transcendence; and it so translates it because these are the terms it is itself accustomed to apply to
	anything which is beyond it, remote from it, not practically affecting it in tangible relations.
	The mind engrossed in matter at first accepts only an objective reality; everything not objectivised or apparently
	capable of some objective expression it calls a lie, a mirage, a dream, an unreality or, if it is favourably
	disposed an ideal.
	When, afterwards, it corrects its views, the first thing it does is to reverse its values; coming into a region and
	level where life in the material world seems remote, unspiritual or apparently not capable of spiritual realisation,
	it immediately applies here its old expressions dream, mirage, lie, unreality or mere false idea and transfers from
	object to spirit its exclusive and intolerant use of the word-symbol reality.
	Add to this mental translation into its own conventional word-values of the fact of unaffected transcendence the
	intellectual conclusions and temperamental repulsions of mental and moral vairagya, both together affecting and
	disfiguring the idea of the world as a system of consciousness values and we have Mayavada.

	Who knows the beginning of things or what mind has ever embraced their end?
	When we have said a beginning, do we not behold spreading out beyond it all the eternity of Time when that which has
	begun was not?
	So also when we imagine an end our vision becomes wise of endless Space stretching out beyond the terminus we have
	fixed.
	Do even forms begin and end?
	Or does eternal Form only disappear from one of its canvases?
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>

	The experiment of human life on an earth is not now for the first time enacted.
	It has been conducted a million times before and the long drama will again a million times be repeated.
	In all that we do now, our dreams, our discoveries, our swift or difficult attainments we profit subconsciously by
	the experience of innumerable precursors and our labour will be fecund in planets unknown to us and in worlds yet
	uncreated.
	The plan, the peripeties, the denouement differ continually, yet are always governed by the conventions of an
	eternal Art.
	God, Man, Nature are the three perpetual symbols.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The idea of eternal recurrence affects with a shudder of alarm the mind entrenched in the minute, the hour, the
	years, the centuries, all the finite's unreal defences.
	But the strong soul conscious of its own immortal stuff and the inexhaustible ocean of its ever-flowing energies is
	seized by it with the thrill of an inconceivable rapture.
	It hears behind the thought the childlike laughter and ecstasy of the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 142</p>
<p class="P">
	God, Man, Nature, what are these three?
	Whence flow their divergences?
	To what ineffable union advances the ever-increasing sum of their contacts?
	Let us look beyond the hours and moments; let us tear down the hedge of the years and the concept-wall of centuries
	and millenniums and break out beyond the limits of our prison-house.
	For all things seek to concentrate our view on the temporal interests, conceptions and realisations of our humanity.
	We have to look beyond them to know that which they serve and represent.
	Nothing in the world can be understood by itself, but only by that which is beyond it.
	If we would know all, we must turn our gaze to that which is beyond all.
	That being known all else is comprehended.

	A beginningless and endless eternity and infinity in which divisible Time and Space manage to subsist is the mould
	of existence.
	They succeed in subsisting because they are upheld by God's view of Himself in things.
</p>
<p class="P">
	God is all existence.
	Existence is a representation of ineffable Being.
	Being is neither eternal nor temporary, neither infinite nor limited, neither one nor many; it is nothing that any
	word of our speech can describe nor any thought of our mentality can conceive.
	The word existence unduly limits it; eternity and infinity are too petty conceptions; the term Being is an x
	representing not an unknown but an unknowable value.
	All values proceed from the Brahman, but it is itself beyond all values.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This existence is an incalculable Fact in which all possible opposites meet; its opposites are in truth identities.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is neither one nor many and yet both one and many.
	Numberlessness increases in it and extends till it reaches unity; unity broken cannot stop short of numberlessness.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 143</p>
<p class="P">
	It is neither personal nor impersonal and yet at once personal and impersonal.
	Personality is a fiction of the impersonal; impersonality the mask of a Person.
	That impersonal Brahman was all the time a world-transcendent Personality and universal Person, is the truth of
	things as it is represented by life and consciousness.
	“I am” is the eternal assertion.
	Analytic thought gets rid of the I, but the Am remains and brings it back.
	Materialism changes “I am” into “It is”, and when it has done so, has changed nothing.
	The Nihilist gets rid of both Am and Is only to find them waiting for him beyond on either side of his negation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	When we examine the Infinite and the Finite, Form and the Formless, the Silence and the Activity, our oppositions
	are equally baffled.
	Try however hard we will, God will not allow us to exclude any of them from His fathomless universality.
	He carries all Himself with Him into every transcendence.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	All this is Infinity grasped by the Finite and the Finite lived by the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The finite is a transience or a recurrence in the infinite, therefore Infinity alone is utterly real.
	But since that Real casts always this shadow of itself and since it is by the finite that its reality becomes
	conceivable, we must suppose that the phenomenon also is not a fiction.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Infinite defines itself in the finite, the finite conceives itself in the Infinite.
	Each is necessary to the other's complete joy of being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Infinite pauses always in the finite; the finite arrives always in the Infinite.
	This is the wheel that circles forever through Time and Eternity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If there were nothing to be transcended, the Transcendent would be incomplete in its own conception.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What is the value of the Formless unless it has stooped to Form?
	And on the other hand what truth or value has any form except to represent as in a mask the Indefinable and
	Invisible?
</p>
<p class="P">
	From what background have all these numberless forms started out, if not from the termless profundities of the
	Incommensurable?
	He who has not lost his knowledge in the Unknowable, knows nothing.
	Even the world he studies so sapiently, cheats and laughs at him.
</p>
<p class="P">
	When we have entered into the Unknowable, then all this other knowledge becomes valid.
	When we have sacrificed all forms into the Formless, then all forms become at once negligible and infinitely
	precious.
</p>
<p class="P">
	For the rest, that is true of all things.
	What we have not renounced, has no worth.
	Sacrifice is the great revealer of values.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	As all words come out of the Silence, so all forms come out of the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	When the word goes back into the silence is it extinct for ever or does it dwell in the eternal harmony?
	When a soul goes back to God is it blotted out from existence or does it know and enjoy that into which it enters?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Does universe ever end?
	Does it not exist eternally in God's total idea of His own being?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Unless the Eternal is tired out by Time as by a load, unless God suffers loss of memory, how can universe cease from
	being?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Neither for soul nor universe is extinction the goal, but for one it is infinite self-possessing and for the other
	the endless pursuit of its own immutably mutable rhythms.

	If Nothing were the beginning Nothing also would be the end; but in that case Nothing also would be the middle.

<p class="P">
	If indiscriminable unity were the beginning it would also be the end.
	But then what middle term could there be except indiscriminable unity?

	There is a logic in existence from which our Thought tries to escape by twisting and turning against its own
	ultimate necessity, as if a snake were to try to get away from itself by coiling round its own body.
	Let it cease coiling and go straight to the root of the whole matter, that there is no first nor last, no beginning
	nor ending, but only a representation of successions and dependences.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Succession and dependence are laws of perspective; they cannot be made a true measure of that which they represent.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Precisely because God is one, indefinable and beyond form, therefore He is capable of infinite definition and
	quality, realisation in numberless forms and the joy of endless self-multiplication.
	These two things go together and they cannot really be divided.

	The first are periods when even a little effort produces great results and changes destiny; the second are spaces of

	Beyond Good and Evil
</h1>
<p class="P">
	God is beyond good and evil; man moving Godwards must become of one nature with him.
	He must transcend good and evil.
</p>
<p class="P">
	God is beyond good and evil, not below them, not existing and limited by them, not even above them, but in a more
	absolute sense excedent and transcendent of the ideas of good and evil.
	He exceeds them in his universality; they exist in him, but the values of good and evil which we give to things is
	not their divine or universal value, they are only their practical value created by us in our psychological and
	dynamic dealings with life.
	God recognises them and seems to deal with us on the basis of this valuation of life, but only to such an extent as
	may serve his purpose in Nature.
	In his universal action he is not limited by them.
	But into his transcendent being of which his highest universal is the image, they do not at all enter; there in the
	highest universal which is to us transcendent is only the absolute good of which both our good and evil have in them
	certain differentiated elements.
	Neither our good nor our evil are or can of themselves give the absolute good; both have to be transformed, evil
	into good, good into pure and self-existent good, before they can be taken up into it.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 149</p>
<p class="P">
	This explains the nature of the universe which would otherwise be inexplicable, inconsistent with the being of God,
	a forcefully inconscient and violently active enigma.
	God must be beyond limitation by our ideas of good, otherwise the universe such as it is could not exist whether as
	the partly manifested being of a divine Existence or a thing created or permitted by a divine Will.
	He cannot, either, be evil, otherwise in man, his highest terrestrial creature or his highest terrestrial
	manifestation, there could not be this dominant idea of good and this stream of tendency towards righteousness.
	He cannot be a mixture of good and evil, whether a self-perplexed and struggling or a mysteriously ordered double
	principle, Ormuzd and Ahriman, or at least he cannot be limited by this duality, for there is much in the universe
	which is neither good nor evil.
	Perhaps the greatest part of the totality is either supramoral or inframoral or simply amoral.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="56" href="#">1</a>
	Good and evil come in with the development of mental consciousness; they exist in their rudimentary elements in the
	animal and primitive human mind, they develop with the human development.
	Good and evil are things which arrive in the process of the evolution; there is then the possibility that they will
	disappear in the process of the evolution.
	If indeed they are essential to its highest possible point of culmination, then they will remain; or if one of them

</p>
<p class="P">
	What then is the self that thou hast to transcend and what is the self that thou hast to become?
	For it is here that thou shouldst make no error; for this error, not to know thyself, is the fountain of all thy
	grief and the cause of all thy stumbling.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 151</p>
<p class="P">
	That which thou hast to transcend is the self that thou appearest to be, and that is man as thou knowest him, the
	apparent Purusha.
	And what is this man?
	He is a mental being enslaved to life and matter; and where he is not enslaved to life and matter, he is the slave
	of his mind.
	But this is a great and heavy servitude; for to be the slave of mind is to be the slave of the false, the limited
	and the apparent.
	The self that thou hast to become, is the self that thou art within behind the veil of mind and life and matter.
	It is to be the spiritual, the divine, the superman, the real Purusha.
	For that which is above the mental being, is the superman.
	It is to be the master of thy mind, thy life and thy body; it is to be a king over Nature of whom thou art now the
	tool, lifted above her who now has thee under her feet.
	It is to be free and not a slave, to be one and not divided, to be immortal and not obscured by death, to be full of
	light and not darkened, to be full of bliss and not the sport of grief and suffering, to be uplifted into power and
	not cast down into weakness.
	It is to live in the Infinite and possess the finite.
	It is to live in God and be one with him in his being.
	To become thyself is to be this and all that flows from it.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Be free in thyself, and therefore free in thy mind, free in thy life and thy body.
	For the Spirit is freedom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Be one with God and all beings; live in thyself and not in thy little ego.
	For the Spirit is unity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Be thyself, immortal, and put not thy faith in death; for death is not of thyself, but of thy body.
	For the Spirit is immortality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To be immortal is to be infinite in being and consciousness and bliss; for the Spirit is infinite and that which is
	finite lives only by his infinity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	These things thou art, therefore thou canst become all this; but if thou wert not these things, then thou couldst
	never become them.
	What is within thee, that alone can be revealed in thy being.
	Thou appearest indeed to be other than this, but wherefore shouldst thou enslave thyself to appearances?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 152</p>
<p class="P">
	Rather arise, transcend thyself, become thyself.
	Thou art man and the whole nature of man is to become more than himself.
	He was the man-animal, he has become more than the animal man.
	He is the thinker, the craftsman, the seeker after beauty.
	He shall be more than the thinker, he shall be the seer of knowledge; he shall be more than the craftsman, he shall
	be the creator and master of his creation; he shall be more than the seeker of beauty, for he shall enjoy all beauty
	and all delight.
	Physical, he seeks for his immortal substance; vital he seeks after immortal life and the infinite power of his
	being; mental and partial in knowledge, he seeks after the whole light and the utter vision.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To possess these is to become the superman; for [it] is to rise out of mind into the supermind.
	Call it the divine mind or Knowledge or the supermind; it is the power and light of the divine will and the divine
	consciousness.
	By the supermind the Spirit saw and created himself in the worlds, by that he lives in them and governs them.
	By that he is Swarat Samrat, self-ruler and all-ruler.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Supermind is superman; therefore to rise beyond mind is the condition.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To be the superman is to live the divine life, to be a god; for the gods are the powers of God.
	Be a power of God in humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To live in the divine Being and let the consciousness and bliss, the will and knowledge of the Spirit possess thee
	and play with thee and through thee, this is the meaning.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This is the transfiguration of thyself on the mountain.
	It is to discover God in thyself and reveal him to thyself in all things.
	Live in his being, shine with his light, act with his power, rejoice with his bliss.
	Be that Fire and that Sun and that Ocean.
	Be that joy and that greatness and that beauty.
</p>
<p class="P">
	When thou hast done this even in part, thou hast attained to the first steps of supermanhood.

	First be sure of the call and of thy soul's answer.
	For if the call is not true, not the touch of God's powers or the voice of his messengers, but the lure of thy ego,

	The outer instruments of mortal man have no force to carry him through the severe ardours of this spiritual journey
	and Titanic inner battle or to meet its terrible or obstinate ordeals or nerve him to face and overcome its subtle
	and formidable dangers.
	Only his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="57" href="#">1</a> spirit's august and steadfast will and the quenchless fire of
	his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="58" href="#">2</a> soul's invincible ardour are sufficient for this difficult

<p class="P">
	Imagine not the way is easy; the way is long, arduous, dangerous, difficult.
	At every step is an ambush, at every turn a pitfall.
	A thousand seen or unseen enemies will start up against thee, terrible in subtlety against thy ignorance, formidable
	in power against thy weakness.
	And when with pain thou hast destroyed them, other thousands will surge up to take their place.
	Hell will vomit its hordes to oppose thee and enring and wound and menace; Heaven will meet thee with its pitiless
	tests and its cold luminous denials.
	Thou shalt find thyself alone in thy anguish, the demons furious in thy path, the Gods unwilling above thee.
	Ancient and powerful, cruel, unvanquished and close and innumerable are the dark and dreadful Powers that profit by
	the reign of Night and Ignorance and would have no change and are hostile.
	Aloof, slow to arrive, far-off and few and brief in their visits are the Bright Ones who are willing or permitted to
	succour.
	Each step forward is a battle.
	There are precipitous descents, there are unending ascensions and ever higher peaks upon peaks to conquer.
	Each plateau climbed is but a stage on the way and reveals endless heights beyond it.
	Each victory thou thinkest the last triumphant struggle proves to be but the prelude to a hundred fierce and
	perilous battles...
	But thou sayest God's hand will be with me and the Divine Mother near with her gracious smile of succour?
	And thou knowest not then that God's grace is more difficult to have or to keep than the nectar of the Immortals or
	Kuvera's priceless treasures?
	Ask of His chosen and they will tell thee how often the Eternal has covered his face from them, how often he has
	withdrawn from them behind his mysterious veil and they have found themselves alone in the grip of Hell, solitary in
	the horror of the darkness, naked and defenceless in the anguish of the battle.
	And if his presence is felt behind the veil, yet is it like the winter sun behind clouds and saves not from the rain
	and snow and the calamitous storm and the harsh wind and the bitter cold and the grey of a sorrowful atmosphere and
	the dun weary dullness.
	Doubtless the help is there even when it seems to be withdrawn, but still is there the appearance of total night
	with no sun to come and no star of hope to pierce the blackness.
	Beautiful is the face of the Divine Mother, but she too can be hard and terrible.
	Nay, then, is immortality a plaything to be given lightly to a child or the divine life a prize without effort or
	the crown for a weakling?
	Strive rightly and thou shalt have; trust and thy trust shall in the end be justified; but the dread Law of the Way

	Man and the Supermind
</h1>
<p class="P">
	Man is a transitional being, he is not final; for in him and high beyond him ascend the radiant degrees
	which<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="59" href="#">1</a> climb to a divine supermanhood.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The step from man towards superman is the next approaching achievement in the earth's evolution.
	There lies our destiny and the liberating key to our aspiring, but troubled and limited human existence — inevitable
	because it is at once the intention of the inner Spirit and the logic of Nature's process.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The appearance of a human possibility in a material and animal world was the first glint of a coming divine Light, —
	the first far-off intimation of a godhead to be born out of Matter.
	The appearance of the superman in the human world will be the fulfilment of that distant shining promise.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The difference between man and superman will be the difference between mind and a consciousness as far beyond it as
	thinking mind is beyond the consciousness of plant and animal; the differentiating essence of man is mind, the
	differentiating essence of superman will be supermind or a divine gnosis.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man is a mind imprisoned, obscured and circumscribed in a precarious and imperfect living but imperfectly conscious
	body.
	The superman will be a supramental spirit which will envelop and freely use a conscious body, plastic to spiritual
	forces.
	His physical frame will be a firm support and an adequate radiant instrument for the spirit's divine play and work
	in Matter.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 158</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind, even free and in its own unmixed and unhampered element, is not the highest possibility of consciousness; for
	mind is not in possession of Truth, but only a minor vessel or an instrument and here an ignorant seeker plucking
	eagerly at a mass of falsehoods and half-truths for the unsatisfying pabulum of its hunger.
	Beyond mind is a supramental or gnostic power of consciousness that is in eternal possession of Truth; all its
	motion and feeling and sense and outcome are instinct and luminous with the inmost reality of things and express
	nothing else.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Supermind or gnosis is in its original nature at once and in the same movement an infinite wisdom and an infinite
	will.
	At its source it is the dynamic consciousness of the divine Knower and Creator.
</p>
<p class="P">
	When in the process of unfolding of an always greater force of the one Existence, some delegation of this power
	shall descend into our limited human nature, then and then only can man exceed himself and know divinely and
	divinely act and create; he will have become at last a conscious portion of the Eternal.
	The superman will be born, not a magnified mental being, but a supramental power descended here into a new life of
	the transformed terrestrial body.
	A gnostic supermanhood is the next distinct and triumphant victory to be won by the spirit descended into earthly
	nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The disk of a secret sun of Power and Joy and Knowledge is emerging out of the material consciousness in which our
	mind works as a chained slave or a baffled and impotent demiurge; supermind will be the formed body of that radiant
	effulgence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Superman is not man climbed to his own natural zenith, not a superior degree of human greatness, knowledge, power,
	intelligence, will, character, genius, dynamic force, saintliness, love, purity or perfection.
	Supermind is something beyond mental man and his limits, a greater consciousness than the highest consciousness
	proper to human nature.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 159</p>
<p class="P">
	Man is a being from the mental worlds whose mentality works here involved, obscure and degraded in a physical brain,
	shut off from its own divinest powers and impotent to change life beyond certain narrow and precarious limits.
	Even in the highest of his kind it is baulked of its luminous possibilities of supreme force and freedom by this
	dependence.
	Most often and in most men it is only a servitor, a purveyor of amusements, a caterer of needs and interests to the
	life and the body.
	But the superman will be a gnostic king of Nature; supermind in him even in its evolutionary beginnings will appear
	as a ray of the eternal omniscience and omnipotence.
	Sovereign and irresistible it will lay hands on the mental and physical instruments, and, standing above and yet
	penetrating and possessing our lower already manifested parts, it will transform mind, life and body into its own
	divine and luminous nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man in himself is hardly better than an ambitious nothing.
	He is a narrowness that reaches towards ungrasped widenesses, a littleness straining towards grandeurs which are
	beyond him, a dwarf enamoured of the heights.
	His mind is a darkened ray in the splendours of the universal Mind.
	His life is a striving exulting and suffering wave, an eager passion-tossed and sorrow-stricken or a blindly and
	dully toiling petty moment of the universal Life.
	His body is a labouring perishable speck in the material universe.
	An immortal soul is somewhere hidden within him and gives out from time to time some sparks of its presence, and an
	eternal spirit is above and overshadows with its wings and upholds with its power this soul continuity in his
	nature.
	But that greater spirit is obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality and this inner
	radiant soul is wrapped, stifled and oppressed in dense outer coatings.
	In all but a few it is seldom active, in many hardly perceptible.
	The soul and spirit in man seem rather to exist above and behind his formed nature than to be a part of its visible
	reality; subliminal in his inner being or superconscient above in some unreached status, they are in his outer
	consciousness possibilities rather than things realised and present.
	The spirit is in course of birth rather than born in Matter.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 160</p>
<p class="P">
	This imperfect being with his hampered, confused, ill-ordered and mostly ineffective consciousness cannot be the end
	and highest height of the mysterious upward surge of Nature.
	There is something more that has yet to be brought down from above and is now seen only by broken glimpses through
	sudden rifts in the giant wall of our limitations.
	Or else there is something yet to be evolved from below, sleeping under the veil of man's mental consciousness or
	half visible by flashes, as life once slept in the stone and metal, mind in the plant and reason in the cave of
	animal memory underlying its imperfect apparatus of emotion and sense-device and instinct.
	Something there is in us yet unexpressed that has to be delivered by an enveloping illumination from above.
	A godhead is imprisoned in our depths, one in its being with a greater godhead ready to descend from superhuman
	summits.
	In that descent and awakened joining is the secret of our future.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man's greatness is not in what he is but in what he makes possible.
	His glory is that he is the closed place and secret workshop of a living labour in which supermanhood is made ready
	by a divine Craftsman.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But he is admitted to a yet greater greatness and it is this that, unlike the lower creation, he is allowed to be
	partly the conscious artisan of his divine change.
	His free assent, his consecrated will and participation are needed that into his body may descend the glory that
	will replace him.
	His aspiration is earth's call to the supramental Creator.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If earth calls and the Supreme answers, the hour can be even now for that immense and glorious transformation.

	The Involved and Evolving Godhead
</h1>
<p class="P">
	The involution of a superconscient Spirit in inconscient Matter is the secret cause of this visible and
	apparent world.
	The keyword of the earth's riddle is the gradual evolution of a hidden illimitable consciousness and power out of
	the seemingly inert yet furiously driven force of insensible Nature.
	Earth-life is one self-chosen habitation of a great Divinity and his aeonic will is to change it from a blind prison
	into his splendid mansion and high heaven-reaching temple.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The nature of the Divinity in the world is an enigma to the mind, but to our enlarging consciousness it will appear
	as a presence simple and inevitable.
	Freed we shall enter into the immutable stability of an eternal existence that puts on this revealing multitude of
	significant mutable forms.
	Illumined we shall become aware of the indivisible light of an infinite consciousness that breaks out here into
	multiform grouping and detail of knowledge.
	Sublimated in might, we shall share the illimitable movement of an omnipotent force that works out its marvels in
	self-imposed limits.
	Fixed in griefless bliss we shall possess the calm and ecstasy of an immeasurable Delight that creates for ever the
	multitudinous waves and rhythms and the ever increasing outward-going and inward-drawing intensities of its own
	creative and communicative world-possessing and self-possessing bliss.
	This, since we are inwardly souls of that Spirit, will be the nature of our fourfold experience when the evolving
	Godhead will work here in its own unveiled movement.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 162</p>
<p class="P">
	If that full manifestation had been from the beginning, there would be no terrestrial problem, no anguish of growth,
	no baffled seeking out of mind and will and life and body towards knowledge and force and joy and an immortal
	persistence.
	But this Godhead, whether within us or outside in things and forces and creatures, started from an involution in
	inconscience of Nature and began by the manifestation of its apparent opposites.
	Out of a vast cosmic inconscience and inertia and insensibility, an initial disguise that is almost non-existence,
	the Spirit in Matter has chosen to evolve and slowly shape, as if in a grudging and gradually yielding material, its
	might and light and infinity and beatitude.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The significance of the terrestrial evolution lies in this slow and progressive liberation of some latent indwelling
	Spirit.
	The heart of its mystery is the difficult appearance, the tardy becoming of a divine Something or Someone already
	involved in physical Nature.
	The Spirit is there with all its potential forces in a first formal basis of its own supporting, yet resistant
	substance.
	Its greater subsequent and deliberately emerging movements, life and mind and intuition and soul and supermind and
	the light of the Godhead are already there, locked up and obscurely compressed into the initial power and first
	expressive values of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Before there could be any evolution, there must needs be this involution of the Divine All that is to emerge.
	Otherwise there would have been not an ordered and significant evolution, but a successive creation of things
	unforeseeable, not contained in their antecedents, not their inevitable consequences or right followers in sequence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This world is not an apparent order fortuitously managed by an inexplicable Chance.
	Neither is it a marvellous mechanism miraculously contrived by a stumblingly fortunate unconscious Force or
	mechanical Necessity.
	It is not even a structure built according to his fancy or will by an external and therefore necessarily a limited
	Creator.
	Mentally conceivable, each of these solutions can explain one side or appearance of things; but it is a greater
	truth that can alone successfully join all the aspects and illumine all the facts of the enigma.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 163</p>
<p class="P">
	If all were indeed a result of cosmic Chance, there would be no necessity of a new advance; nothing beyond mind need
	appear in the material world, — as indeed there was then no necessity for even mind to arise at all out of the
	meaningless blind material whirl.
	Consciousness itself would be only a fortuitous apparition, a strange hallucinating reflection or ghost of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Or if all were the work of a mechanical Force, then too mind need not have appeared at all as part of the huge
	grinding engine; there was no indispensable call for this subtler and yet less competent groping mechanic
	contrivance.
	No frail thinking brain should have been there to labour over the quite sufficient cogs and springs and pistons of
	the first unerring machine.
	A supermind added on this brilliant and painful complication would be still more a superfluity and a luminous
	insolence; it could be nothing more than a false pretension of transitory consciousness to govern and possess the
	greater inconscient Force that is its creator.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Or if an experimenting, external and therefore limited Creator were the inventor of the animal's suffering life and
	man's fumbling mind and this huge mainly unused and useless universe, there was no reason why he should not have
	stopped short with the construction of a mental intelligence in his creatures, content with the difficult ingenuity
	of his labour.
	Even if he were all-powerful and all-wise, he might well pause there, — for if he went farther, the creature would
	be in danger of rising too near to the level of his Maker.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But if this is the truth of things that an infinite Spirit, an eternal Divine Presence and Consciousness and Force
	and Bliss is involved and hidden here and slowly emerges, then is it inevitable that its powers or the ascending
	degrees of its one power should emerge too one after the other till the whole glory is manifested, a mighty divine
	Fact embodied and dynamic and visible.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 164</p>
<p class="P">
	All mental ideas of the nature of things, are inconclusive considerations of our insufficient logical reason when it
	attempts in its limited light and ignorant self-sufficiency to weigh the logical probabilities of a universal order
	which after all its speculation and discovery must remain obscure to it still and an enigma.
	The true witness and discoverer is our growing consciousness; for that consciousness is itself the sign and power of
	the evolving Divine, and its growth out of the apparent inconscience of the material universe is the fundamental,
	the one abiding, progressive index event of the long earth-story.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Only when this evolving consciousness can grow into its own full divine power will we directly know ourselves and
	the world instead of catching at tags and tail ends of an insufficient figure of knowledge.
	This full power of the consciousness is supermind or gnosis, — supermind because to reach it we have to pass beyond
	and turn upon mind as the mind itself has passed and turned upon life and inconscient matter and gnosis because it
	is eternally self-possessed of Truth and in its very stuff and nature it is dynamic substance of knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The true knowledge of things is denied to our reason, because that is not our spirit's greatest essential power but
	only an expedient, a transitional instrument meant to deal with the appearance of things and their phenomenal
	process.
	True knowledge commences only when our consciousness can pass beyond its present normal limit in man: for then it
	becomes directly aware of its self and of the Power in the world and begins to have at least an initial knowledge by
	identity which is the sole true knowledge.
	Henceforward it knows and sees, no longer by the reason groping among external data, but by an ever increasing and
	always more luminous self-illumining and all illuminating experience.
	In the end it will become a conscious part of the Divine revealing itself in the world; its life will be a power for
	the conscious evolution of that which is still unmanifested in the material universe.

</p>
<p class="P">
	But the key of that secret is not to be found in life itself or in the body; its hieroglyph is not in embryo or
	organism, — for these are only a physical means or base: the one significant mystery of this universe is the
	appearance and growth of consciousness in the vast mute unintelligence of Matter.
	The escape of Consciousness out of an apparent initial Inconscience, — but it was there all the time masked and
	latent, for the inconscience of Matter is itself only a hooded consciousness — its struggle to find itself, its
	reaching out to its own inherent completeness, perfection, joy, light, strength, mastery, harmony, freedom, this is
	the prolonged miracle and yet the natural and all-explaining phenomenon of which we are at once the observers and a
	part, instrument and vehicle.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 166</p>
<p class="P">
	A Consciousness, a Being, a Power, a Joy was here from the beginning darkly imprisoned in this apparent denial of
	itself, this original night, this obscurity and nescience of material Nature.
	That which is and was for ever, free, perfect, eternal and infinite, That which all is, That which we call God,
	Brahman, Spirit, has here shut itself up in its own self-created opposite.
	The Omniscient has plunged itself into Nescience, the All-Conscious into Inconscience, the All-Wise into perpetual
	Ignorance.
	The Omnipotent has formulated itself in a vast cosmic self-driven Inertia that by disintegration creates; the
	Infinite is self-expressed here in a boundless fragmentation; the All-Blissful has put on a huge insensibility out
	of which it struggles by pain and hunger and desire and sorrow.
	Elsewhere the Divine is; here in physical life, in this obscure material world, it would seem almost as if the
	Divine is not but is only becoming, <span class="devan_1"> <span style="font-style: normal">θεος ουκ έστιν αλλα
			γιγνεται</span></span>.
	This gradual becoming of the Divine out of its own phenomenal opposites is the meaning and purpose of the
	terrestrial evolution.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Evolution in its essence is not the development of a more and more organised body or a more and more efficient life
	— these are only its machinery and outward circumstance.
	Evolution is the strife of a Consciousness somnambulised in Matter to wake and be free and find and possess itself
	and all its possibilities to the very utmost and widest, to the very last and highest.
	Evolution is the emancipation of a self-revealing Soul secret in Form and Force, the slow becoming of a Godhead, the
	growth of a Spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In this evolution mental man is not the goal and end, the completing value, the highest last significance; he is too
	small and imperfect to be the crown of all this travail of Nature.
	Man is not final, but a middle term only, a transitional being, an instrumental intermediate creature.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 167</p>
<p class="P">
	This character of evolution and this mediary position of man are not at first apparent; for to the outward eye it
	would seem as if evolution, the physical evolution at least were finished long ago leaving man behind as its poor
	best result and no new beings or superior creations were to be expected any longer.
	But this appears to us only so long as we look at forms and outsides only and not at the inner significances of the
	whole process.
	Matter, body, life even are the first terms necessary for the work that had to be done.
	New living forms may no longer be appearing freely, but this is because it is not, or at least it is not primarily,
	new living forms that the Force of evolution is now busied with evolving, but new powers of consciousness.
	When Nature, the Divine Power, had formed a body erect and empowered to think, to devise, to inquire into itself and
	things and work consciously both on things and self, she had what she wanted for her secret aim; relegating all else
	to the sphere of secondary movements, she turned toward that long-hidden aim her main highest forces.
	For all till then was a long strenuously slow preparation; but throughout it the development of consciousness in
	which the appearance of man was the crucial turning point had been kept wrapped within her as her ultimate business
	and true purpose.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This slow preparation of Nature covered immense aeons of time and infinities of space in which they appeared to be
	her only business; the real business strikes on our view at least when we look with the outward eye of reason as if
	it came only as a fortuitous accident, in or near the end, for a span of time and in a speck and hardly noticeable
	corner of one of the smallest provinces of a possibly minor universe among these many boundless finites, these
	countless universes.
	If it were so, we could still reply that time and space matter not to the Infinite and Eternal; it is not a waste of
	labour for That — as it would be for our brief death-driven existences — to work for trillions of years in order to
	flower only for a moment.
	But that paradox too is only an appearance — for the history of this single earth is not all the story of evolution
	— other earths there are even now elsewhere, and even here many earth-cycles came before us, and many are those that
	will come hereafter.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 168</p>
<p class="P">
	Nature laboured for innumerable millions of years to create a material universe of flaming suns and systems; for a
	lesser but still interminable series of millions she stooped to make this earth a habitable planet.
	For all that incalculable time she was or seemed busy only with the evolution of Matter; life and mind were kept
	secret in an apparent non-existence.
	But the time came when life could manifest, a vibration in the metal, a growing and seeking, a drawing in and a
	feeling outward in the plant, an instinctive force and sense, a nexus of joy and pain and hunger and emotion and
	fear and struggle in the animal, — a first organised consciousness, the beginning of the long-planned miracle.
	Thenceforward she was busy no more exclusively with matter for its own sake, but most with palpitant plasmic matter
	useful for the expression of life; the evolution of life was now her one intent purpose.
	And slowly too mind manifested in life, an intensely feeling, a crude thinking and planning vital mind in the
	animal, but in man the full organisation and apparatus, the developing if yet imperfect mental being, the Manu, the
	thinking, devising, aspiring, already self-conscient creature.
	And from that time onward the growth of mind rather than any radical change of life became her shining
	preoccupation, her wonderful wager.
	Body appeared to evolve no more; life itself evolved little or only so much in its cycles as would serve to express
	Mind heightening and widening itself in the living body; an unseen internal evolution was now Nature's great passion
	and purpose.
</p>
<p class="P">
	And if Mind were all that consciousness could achieve, if Mind were the secret Godhead, if there were nothing
	higher, larger, [no] more miraculous ranges, man could be left to fulfil mind and complete his own being and there
	would or need be nothing here beyond him, carrying consciousness to its summits, extending it to its unwalled
	vastnesses, plunging with it into depths unfathomable; he would by perfecting himself consummate Nature.
	Evolution would end in a Man-God, crown of the earthly cycles.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But Mind is not all; for beyond mind is a greater consciousness; there is a supermind and spirit.
	As Nature laboured in the animal, the vital being, till she could manifest out of him man, the Manu, the thinker, so
	she is labouring in man, the mental being till she can manifest out of him a spiritual and supramental godhead, the
	truth conscious Seer, the knower by identity, the embodied Transcendental and Universal in the individual nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	From the clod and metal to the plant, from the plant to the animal, from the animal to man, so much has she
	completed of her journey; a huge stretch or a stupendous leap still remains before her.
	As from matter to life, from life to mind, so now she must pass from mind to supermind, from man to superman; this
	is the gulf that she has to bridge, the supreme miracle that she has to perform before she can rest from her
	struggle and discontent and stand in the radiance of that supreme consciousness, glorified, transmuted, satisfied
	with her labour.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The subhuman was once here supreme in her, the human replacing it walks now in the front of Time, but still, aim and
	goal of the future there waits the supramental, the superman, an unborn glory yet unachieved before her.

	The Path
</h1>
<p class="P">
	The supramental Yoga is at once an ascent towards God and a descent of Godhead into the embodied nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The ascent can only be achieved by a one-centred all-gathering upward aspiration of the soul and mind and life and
	body; the descent can only come by a call of the whole being towards the infinite and eternal Divine.
	If this call and this aspiration are there, or if by any means they can be born and grow constantly and seize all
	the nature, then and then only a supramental uplifting and transformation becomes possible.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The call and the aspiration are only first conditions; there must be along with them and brought by their effective
	intensity an opening of all the being to the Divine and a total surrender.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This opening is a throwing wide of all the nature on all its levels and in all its parts to receive into itself
	without limits the greater divine Consciousness which is there already above and behind and englobing this mortal
	half-conscious existence.
	In the receiving there must be no inability to contain, no breaking down of anything in the system, mind or life or
	nerve or body under the transmuting stress.
	There must be an endless receptivity, an always increasing capacity to bear an ever stronger and more and more
	insistent action of the divine Force.
	Otherwise nothing great and permanent can be done; the Yoga will end in a break-down or an inert stoppage or a
	stultifying or a disastrous arrest in a process which must be absolute and integral if it is not [to] be a failure.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 170</p>
<p class="P">
	But since no human system has this endless receptivity and unfailing capacity, the supramental Yoga can succeed only
	if the Divine Force as it descends increases the personal power and equates the strength that receives with the
	Force that enters from above to work in the nature.
	This is only possible if there is on our part a progressive surrender of the being into the hands of the Divine;
	there must be a complete and never failing assent, a courageous willingness to let the Divine Power do with us
	whatever is needed for the work that has to be done.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man cannot by his own effort make himself more than man; the mental being cannot by his own unaided force change
	himself into a supramental spirit.
	A descent of the Divine Nature can alone divinise the human receptacle.
</p>
<p class="P">
	For the powers of our mind, life and body are bound to their own limitations and, however high they may rise or
	however widely expand, they cannot rise above their natural ultimate limits or expand beyond them.
	But, still, mental man can open to what is beyond him and call down a supramental Light, Truth and Power to work in
	him and do what the mind cannot do.
	If mind cannot by effort become what is beyond mind, supermind can descend and transform mind into its own
	substance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If the supramental Power is allowed by man's discerning assent and vigilant surrender to act according to its own
	profound and subtle insight and flexible potency, it will bring about slowly or swiftly a divine transformation of
	our present semiperfect nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This descent, this working is not without its possibility of calamitous fall and danger.
	If the human mind or the vital desire seizes hold on the descending force and tries to use it according to its own
	limited and erring ideas or flawed and egoistic impulses, — and this is inevitable in some degree until this lower
	mortal has learned something of the way of that greater immortal nature, — stumblings and deviations, hard and
	seemingly insuperable obstacles and wounds and suffering cannot be escaped and even death or utter downfall are not
	impossible.
	Only when the conscious integral surrender to the Divine has been learned by mind and life and body, can the way of
	the Yoga become easy, straight, swift and safe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 171</p>
<p class="P">
	And it must be a surrender and an opening to the Divine alone and to no other.
	For it is possible for an obscure mind or an impure life force in us to surrender to undivine and hostile forces and
	even to mistake them for the Divine.
	There can be no more calamitous error.
	Therefore our surrender must be no blind and inert passivity to all influences or any influence, but sincere,
	conscious, vigilant, pointed to the One and the Highest alone.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Self-surrender to the divine and infinite Mother, however difficult, remains our only effective means and our sole
	abiding refuge.
	Self-surrender to her means that our nature must be an instrument in her hands, the soul a child in the arms of the
	Mother.

	All existence, whatever its appearance or its process of being, is and draws its substance, origin, energy, truth
	from a Spirit which is the beginning, middle and end of all — itself being eternal, infinite, self-existent beyond
	end or beginning, beyond Space and Time, beyond Form and Quality and Circumstance as well as in Space and Time, in
	Form and Quality and Circumstance.
	This is the fundamental Reality which is hidden from our knowledge, the one Truth on which all other truths depend,
	those that affirm it as well as those that seem to contradict it.
	To be conscious of this Reality and its right relations with the other truths or appearances of existence, to live
	in it and govern by its Truth all our being, consciousness, nature, will, action would then be the law of a perfect
	life.
	If human life is imperfect, it is because its consciousness moves seeking, groping, experimenting in a fundamental
	ignorance of the real truth of its own being and is therefore unable to know or to effectuate the true law of its
	life.
	It is only if man can overcome this ignorance and inability that he can hope to perfect his life and nature.
	If there is no means of doing that, then he can never hope to escape from his imperfection — and the suffering which
	is its consequence.
	He can only either die in his ignorance escaping from an incurable imperfection and suffering by a physical
	extinction or escape out of it by a spiritual extinction gained through an awakening of the soul to the illusoriness
	of birth and world and Nature or [...] and hope to get [out] of it into some other supraterrestrial state of
	existence.
	Human life on earth can then never grow into anything fundamentally other, better or more perfect than it is now.
	The hope that by using our reason and observing or utilising the laws of Nature we can arrive at a perfect life here
	is futile, for our nature here being itself ignorant and imperfect cannot arrive at anything better than a mitigated
	imperfection and ignorance.
	But if there is a means by which we can arrive at a true knowledge of the reality behind things and enter into its
	Truth and Light and Power then there is no reason why our life here should not become divine and perfect.
	It is through Yoga that this means can be found and this emergence become possible.

	A greater existence and consciousness than what we are now or are in our surface being, to which yet we can by
	certain means raise ourself and become or enter into that, — this is the postulate of all Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What is this greater consciousness and existence?
	It is something or someone eternal and infinite, absolute or perfect, in which all is, from which all comes, to
	which all returns and which is the secret self of all things.
	All is by its existence, all is conscious by its consciousness, continues to be by its Ananda of being, thinks by
	its Mind, lives by its life, is a form of its Energy in the Cosmos.
	But still the existence we live, the consciousness we use, the highest joy of being which we experience, our mind,
	life, body, force are but a fragmentary phenomenon of or in It.
	That Eternal is the All, the whole, our greater Self, our completeness, our universe, yet is it more than any
	universe.
	If no universe were, it still would be.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 179</p>
<p class="P">
	This Eternal and Infinite is not only an Eternal of endless Time and Space.
	For its eternity can be realised not only in the endless progression of the years and aeons but in a single moment
	of Time, its infinity not only in the boundless extension of space to which we can assign no end or border, but in
	the most infinitesimal atom of an atom.
	But beyond the moment and the endless aeons the eternity of the Eternal is timeless and beyond the spatial Infinite
	and Infinitesimal the infinity of the Infinite is spaceless.

<p class="P">
	All begins from the Divine, from the Eternal, from the Infinite, all abides in it alone and by it alone, all ends or
	culminates in the divine Eternal and Infinite.
	This is the first postulate indispensable for our spiritual seeking — for on no other base can we found the highest
	knowledge and the highest life.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All time moves in the Eternal; all space is spread in the Infinite; all creatures and creations live by that in them
	which is Divine.
	This is patently true of an inner spiritual but also proves in the end to be true of this outer space and time.
	It is known to our inmost being that it lives because it is part of the Divine, but it is true also of the external
	and phenomenal creature compounded of ignorant Mind, blind life and subconscious Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A secret Self is the Alpha and Omega of this manifested existence; it is also the constant term, the omnipresent x
	into which all things resolve separately or together and which is their sum, their constituting material and their
	essence.
	All here is secretly the Divine, all is the Eternal, all is the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But this secret truth of things is contradicted by the world's external appearances, it is denied by all the facts
	placed before us by our mind and senses, inconsistent with the sorrow and suffering of the world, incompatible with
	the imperfection of living beings and the unchangeable inconscience of things.
	What then pushes the mind to affirm it? what compels us to admit a seeing of things which is in conflict with our
	outer seeing and experience?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 180</p>
<p class="P">
	For on the surface of our consciousness and all around us there is only the temporal and transient, only [the]
	confined and finite.
	What seems largest to us finds its limit, what we dreamed to be enduring comes to an end; even this vast universe
	with its masses of worlds upon worlds which seemed to stretch into infinity is convicted in the end of being only a
	boundless finite.
	Man claiming to be a divine soul and an all-discovering intellect is brought up short by Nature's rude proof of his
	ignorance and incompetence and exhibits constantly in his thoughts the proneness to self-confident error and in his
	feelings and acts the petty faultiness, meanness, and darkness or suddenly the abysses of falsehood or foulness or
	cruelty of his nature.
	In the management of his world the much that is undivine prevails easily over the little that is divine or they are
	inextricably mixed together.
	The ideal fails in practice, religion degenerates quickly into a settled sectarian fanaticism or formality, the
	triumphant good turns into an organised evil.
	The Christian doctrine of the fall, the Indian idea of the wandering of the Soul in a cosmic illusion or the sceptic
	affirmation of an inconscient material Nature producing the freak of consciousness seems often to be the kernel of
	the whole matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	And yet if we go deep enough into ourselves, we strike against something valid that proves to be a veiled divine
	element which affirms its immortality, Soul.
	If we go beyond our embodied mind and senses we break suddenly into something permanent that feels itself to be
	eternal and infinite, that cannot see itself as anything else and we also cannot conceive of it as anything else, an
	infinite Self, an eternal Spirit.
	Moreover in our most secret essence we are convinced of perfection or of perfectibility — perfection in our deepest
	spiritual being, perfectibility in our nature; we have the instinct and intuition of the Divine.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Even to Time and Space our mind cannot fix or conceive a beginning or an end; it cannot conceive a first bound or a
	last, a primary or ultimate moment without at once looking beyond it.
	If we see the imperfection of things, the very idea implies a potentiality of a perfection by comparison with which
	they are imperfect, and this potentiality points to a beyond Mind and beyond Sense which is the integrally and
	permanently perfect.
	Every relative supposes an absolute.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 181</p>
<p class="P">
	For a long time we have been asked not to believe in these things, to put our trust only in the measuring rods of
	science and its calculations and crucibles, to accept only what is materially ascertamable and measurable.
	But these measurements are those of something that is limited — how can we ascertain by it whether there is or is
	not the Illimitable?
	The instruments by which we question Nature in order to find out what is ascertainable have been proved to give only
	the results which are already contained in the question or in the questioner.
	Science gives us the measures and process of things within the physical limit, but it has failed [to] tell us what
	things are, their final origin or their reason of existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In all this questing by one end or the other we cannot get beyond ourselves and it is better then to look into the
	inner side of ourselves, — why should we limit ourselves only to our responses to an outer evidence?
	Let us explore ourselves and not only our sense or perception of what is around us.
	And in ourselves let us look not only at our surfaces but at the inner and the inmost of our being and nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This self-knowledge pursued far enough shows us a deeper than the surface mind and a deeper than the physical sense,
	a profounder than the outward life.
	It shows us also a Beyond-Mind and Beyond-Sense, a Beyond-Life; the limited passes into [the] illimitable.
	If there were not this capacity of research, we would have to be content with an unsatisfied agnosticism; but the
	means is there by which we can know ourselves and this Alpha and X and Omega of things or if not absolutely It at
	any rate its status and its dynamis, the law of its being and the law of its nature quite as deeply and more deeply
	than Science can show us the law and process of the physical universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	For the moment let us affirm only this result that this spiritual search and knowledge leads us beyond the
	phenomenon which apparently contradicts it to that which beyond the phenomenon brings us to the Divine Eternal and
	Infinite.

	Form is manifested and withdrawn from manifestation; it may be manifested by immediate apparition or it may be

<p class="P">
	All being ranges between the Manifestation and the Non-Manifestation.
	These are the two poles of the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Non-Manifestation is not a Non-Existence.
	Non-Existence is a term created by the mind and has no absolute significance; there is no such thing as an absolute
	Nihil or Zero.
	It is agreed even by the philosophies of the Nihil, Tao or Zero (Sunya) that the Non-Existence of which they speak
	is a Nought in which all is and from which all comes.
	Tao, Nihil or Zero is not different from the Absolute or the Supreme Brahman of Vedanta; it is only another way of
	describing or naming it.
	The Supreme is an Existence beyond what we know of our existence and therefore only it can seem to our mind as a
	Zero, a Nihil, a Non-Existence.
	There is nothing there of what we know as existence, for though all is in Tao, yet all is there in a way of which
	our mind can have no conception or experience, therefore to the mind it has<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="65" href="#">1</a> no reality and brings no concept of existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The manifestation in the Ignorance, that in which we live, has also been described as Asat, a non-existence, because
	it is not real, eternal, infinite, divine; it must therefore be an illusion, since only That exists and nothing
	else.
	But even Illusionism agrees that the manifested world is not without reality, — it is practically real, but not
	eternal.
	Moreover manifestation even if illusory in this sense, has no end or beginning in itself, but only to the soul that
	withdraws from it.
	It goes on existing eternally to other souls, it goes on existing to the Eternal.
	It is in the eternal consciousness that it exists, though apart from that consciousness it has no existence.
	Moreover the stuff of which it is made is not nothingness or void, but the Eternal itself which manifests it from
	itself and out of its own substance cast into form and force.
	It is therefore not a real Nihil, but a limited and constantly renewed, recurrent or mutable existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is therefore permissible to say that all being ranges between Manifestation and Non-Manifestation, for both are
	degrees of existence, the one rising towards the Absolute, the other in appearance, but in appearance only,

	The world is a manifestation, and in it the absolute Parabrahman manifests as the Ishwara, the one Eternal, but also

	Existence is composed of Prakriti and Purusha, the consciousness that sees and the consciousness that executes and

	The one we call Soul, the other Nature.
	These are the first double term from which our Yoga has to start.
	When we come to look in at ourselves instead of out at the world and begin to analyse our subjective experience, we
	find that there are two parts of our being which can be, to all appearance, entirely separated from each other, one
	a consciousness which is still and passive and supports, and the other a consciousness which is busy, active and
	creative, and is supported.
	The passive and fundamental consciousness is the Soul, the Purusha, Witness or Sakshi; the active and
	superstructural consciousness is Nature, Prakriti, processive or creative energy of the Sakshi.
	But the two seem at first to stand apart and distinct, as if they had no share in each other.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Purusha, still and silent witness of whatever Prakriti chooses to create, not interfering with her works, but
	reflecting only whatever forms, names and movements she casts on the pure mirror of his eternal existence and the
	Prakriti restlessly creating, acting, forming and effecting things for the delight of the Purusha, compose the
	double system of the Sankhyas.
	But as we continue analysing their relations and accumulate more and more experience of our subjective life, we find
	that this seeing of the Purusha is in effect a command.
	Whatever Prakriti perceives it to be the pleasure of the Purusha to see, she tends to preserve in his subjective
	experience or to establish; whatever she perceives it to be his pleasure to cease to see, she tends to renounce and
	abolish.
	Whatever he consents to in her, she forces on him and is glad of her mastery and his submission, but whenever he
	insists, she is bound eventually to obey.
	Easily found to be true in our subjective experience, this ultimate principle of things is eventually discovered by
	the Yogin to determine even objective phenomena.
	The Purusha and Prakriti are therefore not only the Witness and the Activity witnessed, but the Lord and his
	executive energy.
	The Purusha is Ishwara, the Prakriti is His shakti.
	Their play with each other is both the motive and the executive force of all existence in the universe.

	All existence is one in the Reality; manifold in its manifestation of the Reality.
	The Reality is the Absolute, the Spirit, the Self, the Being, the One-Existence, which is all and everywhere, but
	which is also more than all and nowhere.
	This One can be all because it is no one in particular, it can be all-pervading and eternal in its essence because
	it is not bound by Space or by Time.
	It is One but it is also multitudinous, its multitudes are the self-expression, not the denial, the abundance, not
	the division or fragmentation of its oneness.
	Each being of its multitudes seems to be a portion of the One, a finite of the Infinite, a time-face and time-form
	of the Eternal; but in and behind this appearance is the Reality, and there each is itself the One displaying
	something of itself, each is the Infinite in a finite phenomenon of itself, each is the Eternal playing in Time.
	But Time too is eternal, Time is eternity in extension and movement, therefore each is in its reality an eternal
	being of the Eternal, an infinite of the Infinite, a spirit of the One spirit, a self of the One Self.
	For the Reality is beyond our oppositions of one and many; its oneness and its multitude are for ever inherent in
	each other; yet it is bound neither by its unity nor its multiplicity, though both are true, because it is that of
	which both are intimate aspects, — it is the Absolute.

	How, it is asked, do we make a permanent and changeless world out of a world of changing and transient objects?
	But this is to create a problem where there is none.
	We do nothing of the kind; what we do is to perceive by the senses a world of stability in constant motion, of
	sameness in spite of change.
	It is the world that is like that; we do not make it so; our senses receive, they do not<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="68" href="#">1</a> create; if there is an error in their perceptions or images it is a passive

	Men are always changing, but man has a permanent character which does not alter.
	Tigers differ from each other and from themselves in the process of time, but the tiger is always the same animal
	and always as such recognisable.
	It is the details that vary and change, the type, the fundamental pattern is constant.
	So far our senses and our mind standing upon their data do not betray or deceive us.
	If they see a world that is stable and the same in spite of constant mobility and mutation, it is because the world
	is like that and it is therefore that we have to see it so and cannot see it otherwise.
	If there is a problem it is not what we make of it, not a problem of our psychology but why it is so, what is behind
	the mobility of the world and its stability, what is the cause or the significance or reality of it.
	There is no doubt the problem of what are mind and sense and their nature, their reality, their relation to the
	world and its cause or significance; but that too is a problem of metaphysics.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 201</p>
<p class="P">
	Are there then two worlds, the one changing and existing in time, the other changeless and eternal?
	Or are there rather two ways of knowing one and the same world?
	These questions, as they are put, are meaningless; for it is obvious that it is one world we are seeing and not two
	and that objects here belong to the same universe and not to two different universes at the same time.
	It cannot be the truth that man belongs to one world and men in their mutability to another or that in seeing the
	changes and variations of the species tiger we are seeing the world in one way and when we see the persistence of
	type of the species we are knowing it in a different way.
	These artificial problems are the result of looking at words and concepts instead of things; we concentrate on the
	words and concepts “sameness” and “change”, see that they represent as abstractions ideas that stand opposed to each
	other, imagine that they are as opposed in fact as in our minds, are incompatible and therefore cannot coexist in
	the same world or cannot be true at the same time or in the same world-perception.
	As a matter of fact there is no such incompatibility; something that is permanently the same may be in constant
	change of its details of existence without losing its constant fundamental sameness.
	There is no reason why something should not be transient (not therefore unreal) in many of its phenomena, yet
	permanent in itself, in its being, whether that permanence be only a duration in time or eternal.
	No doubt, two worlds may meet, world of mind or spirit enter into world of Matter, but then their elements combine
	into one world, a world let us say of mind-informed or spirit-governed Matter; it is not two separate worlds that we
	are seeing at the same time and confusing together by the erroneous action of our mind and senses.
	Our souls, our minds may belong by origination to the mind world or spirit world, but here they are in the same
	world as the changing life and body and in so seeing it, we make no error.

	A philosophy of change?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69" href="#">1</a>
	But what is change?
	In ordinary parlance change means passage from one condition to another and that would seem to imply passage from
	one status to another status.
	The shoot changes into a tree, passes from the status of shoot to the status of tree and there it stops; man passes
	from the status of young man to the status of old man and the only farther change possible to him is death or
	dissolution of his status.
	So it would seem that change is not something isolated which is the sole original and eternal reality, but it is
	something dependent on status, and if status were non-existent, change also could not exist.
	For we have to ask, when you speak of change as alone real, change of what, from what, to what?
	Without this “what” change could not be.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Change is evidently the change of some form or state of existence from one condition to another condition.
	Otherwise, what is it?
	Is it itself fundamental and absolute, not explicable or definable by any other term than itself, perceivable and
	intelligible as the sole reality by a naked intuition which feels and cries out “Change = reality” and then falls
	dumb and can say no more?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 203</p>
<p class="P">
	An object changes, a person changes, a condition of things changes.
	But can it be said that the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="70" href="#">2</a> object is no real object but only a
	continuity of change, or that a person is not a person but a continuity of change, a condition of things is not a
	condition and there are no things but there is only a continuity of change?
	This seems to be an illustration of the besetting sin of metaphysics — to exalt a word into a reality or an idea
	into a reality — without fathoming what is the reality which it tries to indicate.
	For to label with a word or name is not to fathom and to define, to erect a concept is not to fathom.
	Fathom for us then what is change before you ask us to accept it as the only reality.
	You may say I have fathomed it, I have seen it to be the one constant real, but do not ask me to define what it is;
	“listen rather in silence to the silence of Nature and you too will fathom”.
	But what if, so listening, I fathom other realities than change — let us say, immutable being as well as mutable
	force, status as well as change?
	To prevent that you plunge into speech and not silence, into dialectics of the intellect instead of the undebatable
	certitudes of intuition, and so abandon your own methodology.
	If intuition alone is to be used, then you must give a place to my intuition as well as yours and all, however
	contradictory in appearance must stand until a greater intuition comes in to put all in their place, reconcile,
	include in a consistent whole.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In the world of our experience contradictories [are] often complements and necessary to each other's existence.
	Change is possible only if there is a status from which to change; but status again exists only as a step that
	pauses, a step in the continuous passage of change or a step on which change pauses before it passes on to another
	step in its creative passage.
	And behind this relation is a duality of eternal status and eternal motion and behind this duality is something that
	is neither status nor change but contains both as its aspects — and That is likely to be the true Reality.

	This self-oblivion is the primary phenomenon of material existence.

<p class="P">
	The nature of being aware of itself, in possession of all its consciousness and force is the inherent delight of its
	own existence.
	For experience shows that all complete possession of self is delight, only imperfection of possession creates
	imperfection or apparent absence of delight.
	But the one existence takes an equal delight in all the universal forms and figures of its own being, and this
	delight is the cause and support of universal and individual existence.
	For this reason all creation also and all action of force has secretly or overtly delight or a seeking for delight
	or [?some] attraction as its first motive cause, although the apparent object or aim of the action may seem to be of
	a different character.
</p>
<p class="P">

	In experience even on the spiritual plane so long as we do not transcend the spirit in mind, there is a difference
	between peace and Ananda.
	Peace is the Divine static, Ananda the Divine dynamic.
	Peace is a negative-positive; it is positive of itself, of status, of eternity, of the essential, of the
	abstract-concrete, of force in rest.
	It is or tends to be negative of all that is less than itself, contradictory to itself or more than itself, of the
	dynamic, of action, of creation, of time and happening, of the substantial concrete, of force in motion.
	Or when it allows these things or even feels or supports them, it is with a certain disinterested separateness.
	It has essentially the character of the Witness Spirit or at the most of the disinterested Witness-Creator.
	Ananda is in its every fibre a positive of positives.
	It affirms and rejoices in all that is native to peace, but it affirms too and rejoices in all that peace negates or
	regards with a sovereign separateness.
	Ananda is an all embracing and creative force.
	There can be in the world's tangle of conflicting forces an Ananda of pain and suffering and in the full
	manifestation pain and suffering no longer remain themselves but are transformed into Ananda.
	But these opposing differences prove in the end to be part of the separative mental creation, the disjunctive Maya
	in which we live.
	In supermind experience peace is always full of Ananda and by its Ananda can act and create; Ananda is for ever full
	of the divine peace and its most vehement ecstatic intensity contains no possibility of disturbance.
	At the height of the supramental Infinite peace and Ananda are one.
	For there status and dynamis are inseparable, rest and action affirm each other, essence and expression are one

<p class="P">
	The position taken up by the Illusionists must first be firmly stated; for often there is a great nebulousness in
	the minds both of its supporters and antagonists which leaves room for much confused thinking and the real issue,
	the vital point gets obscured.
	We must first give this admission to the defence for whatever it is worth, that Illusionism does not affirm the
	absolute non-existence of the universe but only that it is an existence which is in its beginning and its end a
	non-existence and in its middle it is an existence which amounts to non-existence.
	It is real while it lasts to the mind that creates it; but it is not really real, — it is only phenomenally
	existent, like a dream, like a hallucination, like the imaginations of a person in delirium.
	Three questions arise from this proposition.
	Is this hallucinatory creation of the universe a truth or is the theory itself a hallucination of the logical mind
	or of the experiencing consciousness?
	Secondly, if true, how does the illusion come about and how is it possible?
	Thirdly, who is the victim of the hallucination?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 211</p>
<p class="P">
	The whole theory arises from and turns on one original proposition of which it is the logical consequence.
	It is this that Brahman the one real, original and eternal existence is, firstly, self-existent, secondly,
	featureless and relationless, thirdly, unmodifiable, immutable, incapable therefore of developing feature and
	relation, fourthly, solely existent, for there is and can be nothing else but that in existence.
	None of these original positions about the Brahman imposes itself irrefutably upon the intellect; there are
	philosophies which deny them one and all and with quite as good a show of logic as any the logical apparatus of the
	Mayavada can furnish us.
	In fact, what we first see as the one experience of our consciousness is not this at all, but just the opposite.
	We see that every thing reduces itself not to an existence at all, but to a continuity of the action of Force, Karma
	as the Buddhists call it.
	We see that this action of Force exists only by an infinite flux of feature and relation, the stream of the Buddhist
	figure.
	Apart from that it is nothing, it is the Buddhist sunya or Nihil, and the reduction of the universe to its original
	starting point, the escape out of it is not a return to the self-existent, but a return to Nihil, a Nirvana or
	extinction.
	Far, then, from being immutable and incapable of modification, it is in its very nature a constant modification and
	mutation.
	Eliminate the stream of becoming and the result is not Being, but a zero.
	This is the difficulty which the Mayavada has to surmount, the logic which it has to refute.
</p>
<p class="P">
	For it cannot be denied that the universe, the thing from which all our conscious experience starts, is such a
	constant stream of becoming, a round of mutations and modifications, a mass of features and relations.
	The question is how is it maintained? what is [it] that gives an appearance of permanence to the impermanent, of
	stability to the unstable, of a sum of eternal sameness in which all the elements of the sum are in constant
	instability and all capable of mutation?
	The Buddhist admits that it is done by an action of consciousness, by idea and association, vijnana, sanskara; but
	ideas and associations are themselves Karma, action of Force, themselves impermanent, only they create an appearance
	of permanence, by always acting in the same round, creating the same combination of forms and elements, as the flame
	and stream appear always the same, though that which constitutes them is always impermanent.
	The modern Materialist says that it is material Force or an eternal Energy which takes the form of Matter and
	follows always the same inherent law of action.
	The Mayavadin says on the contrary that it is Consciousness, but a consciousness which is in its reality immutable
	and unmodifiable self-existence, only it produces a phenomenon of constant modification and mutation.
	How is this possible?
	There lies the riddle, for it is a direct self-contradiction.
	To escape from it, he alleges that the phenomenon has no reality at all, but is an illusion.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 213212</p>
<p class="P">
	To deal with this theory at all, we have first to admit that consciousness is the cause and continent of the
	universe and that it exists only in consciousness and not at all in itself.
	How does he [<em>the Mayavadin</em>] propose to prove it?
	It is by an appeal to reason and experience.
	Our reason tells us that we have no knowledge of the existence of the universe except by our conscious mentality, no
	possibility of knowing it; the universe can only be allowed to exist by a consciousness admitting its existence,
	supporting it by its assent.
	If by any chance, law or process our consciousness can cease finally to be aware of the universe, then so far as we
	are concerned, the universe no longer exists; it is annulled to us, it was an illusion from which we are released,
	as when a dream or hallucination ceases.
	Any such final upshot proves that originally also the universe was non-existent, for otherwise, if it had existed
	for us eternally without beginning, it would also continue for us eternally without end.
	But even if it ceases for us, it still continues in existence, is capable of being observed and lived in by others.
	How is that?
	We must suppose, that since it exists cosmically, its existence must be admitted and supported by the assent of a
	universal consciousness by which and for which it is or rather seems to be.
	Well, if by any chance, law or process this universal consciousness ceases finally to be aware of the universe, then
	the universe no longer exists for anybody or anything at all; it is proved to be an utter illusion, existent
	phenomenally only so long as the universal consciousness admitted it, but capable of coming to an end and therefore
	shown to be non-existent in its beginning and in its end nonexistent.
	Now our ultimate experience is that there is a last and highest state of consciousness in which the universe does
	thus cease for the individual to be.
	What is that state?
	It is samadhi, a trance of consciousness in which the sole experience is thus expressed, “I am in bliss” and the
	sole memory brought back is “I was in bliss.”
	In this state the universe has for the individual no existence; he is released from it.
	Therefore this highest state of experience is one of which only three things can be affirmed, existence,
	consciousness of existence, bliss of the consciousness of existence; but it is a pure existence without other
	feature or any relation.
	But how is this proved to be the ultimate state of our conscious being?
	Well, it is the knowledge of the sages who have entered into it that it is the ultimate state, it is the knowledge
	left behind them that they have finally passed away into it not to return to consciousness of the phenomenal world,
	and it is confirmed by the authority of the Veda.
	Reason tells us that such a condition must be the ultimate condition, since it is one infinitely beyond the
	phenomenal and to which the phenomenal arrives by self-elimination, and being the ultimate it must be also the
	original: the phenomenal which disappears from it, must originally have been imposed on it.
	There is no rational escaping from that conclusion.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Well, the individual soul can escape from consciousness of the universe, but what of the universal consciousness?
	For so long as the universe goes on existing — and who shall say that it is not for all eternity? — this escape may
	only prove that the individual soul goes into a state of unconsciousness or absorbed self-consciousness, like a man
	going to sleep or falling into a trance, while the world goes on around him just as before essentially unaffected
	and not at all annulled by his unconsciousness of it.
	But in the first place this highest power of the individual consciousness cannot be peculiar to it, for it must be a
	power of the general and universal; the individual reflects the universal, for it is only the law of the universal
	that can be repeated with individual modifications in the law of the individual.
	Secondly, the universal soul is the same in all; for that is the experience of the highest knowledge and
	consciousness, that there [is] one self in all, featureless, immutable, unmodifiable, the same amidst all the
	changes of phenomena.
	As this self can draw back that which supports the individual into it, so it is and must be capable of drawing back
	that which supports the universal.
	In one case the stream of phenomena centred around its individual reflection ceases, in the other the stream of
	phenomena centred around its universal reflection.
	A theory only?
	But it is justified by reason acting on our total experience which sees the lower or phenomenal and the higher or
	eternal and sees how the phenomenal disappears, vanishes away from the face of the eternal.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 214</p>
<p class="P">
	We have then as a fact a supreme state of existence which is self-existent, the original I am, which is featureless
	bliss and consciousness of being, immutable, eternal and this seems to be common to all beings, secret in all, the
	real self of all.
	But what then of the world?
	It is a mass of constant modifications of consciousness and being, itself in its nature modification of
	consciousness or of being or of both.
	It cannot be a modification of nothing, it must be a modification of something.
	If consciousness and being are the first fact, real, eternal, is it not a modification of conscious being, of this
	real, this eternal something, and itself therefore real?
	Is it not itself eternal, an eternal continuity of modification, uninterrupted continual or else interrupted and
	recurringly continual?
	Must we not then suppose two states of the Brahman, a primary state of eternal unmodified being, a secondary state
	of eternal continuity of modifications of being, becomings of the Brahman?
	Does not the Vedantic statement that all comes from the Brahman, exists by it, returns to it, imply that all is
	eternally contained in it and all are modifications of it?
	In that case, we cannot say that the Eternal Being is absolutely unmodifiable.
	No, says the Illusionist, the supreme eternal self is not only unmodified, but unmodifiable and nothing else but the
	eternal unmodifiable self exists really: all else is seeming.
	How then do all these modifications come about?
	What is the clue to this mystery, the cause of this magic of illusion?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 216215</p>
<p class="P">
	Maya, answers the Illusionist.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="72" href="#">1</a>
	And what is Maya?
	It is a power of the eternal consciousness of Brahman by which there comes about an apparent modification of
	consciousness of which all these modifications we call the universe are the outcome.
	The modification is apparent, not real, yet a fact, unreally, non-existently existent.
	Maya exists, yet does not exist; and its results too are apparent, not real, yet while Maya lasts, they are a fact
	we have to deal with, unreally, non-existently existent.
	We have to escape from them, by escaping from Maya.
	We do not understand.
	How can the unmodifiable consciousness undergo at all even an apparent modification, to say nothing of such
	portentous results of the modification?
	To that there is no explanation, there can be no explanation.
	It takes place beyond the intellect, before the intellect can at all exist and cannot be understood by the
	intellect; it must be accepted as a fact; it is a fact that Maya is, it is a fact that Maya can be escaped from, and
	therefore not being eternal, is transient, is unreal, is not.
	To see this and escape is our only business.
	Only while it lasts, are we concerned with the modifications.
	But what is meant by saying while it lasts and who is it that is subject to it and escapes from it?
	Is it Brahman who is subject to Maya?
	No, Brahman the eternally unmodifiable consciousness aware only of the bliss of its self-existence cannot be subject
	to Maya, does not behold this phenomenal illusion.
	For if he did, we returning into that, should also behold it and could not by the returning escape from it.
	It is the individual soul only that is subject to Maya and escapes from it.
	But who is this individual soul?
	Is it the self in the individual, the Jivatman, and is the self in the individual different from the eternal Self?
	No, the individual self is the eternal Brahman, for there is only one self and not many.
	But then the Jivatman also cannot be subject to Maya or escape from it.
	There is then nobody subject to it, nobody who escapes.
	And really that is so, says the illusionist, but what seems to us now to be the individual self, is a reflection of
	the eternal Self in the mind, and it is that which is subject to Maya and suffers by it.
	But what then is Mind?
	It is a result of Maya, it is an illusory movement of consciousness, it is that for which and by which the universe
	exists.
	Get rid of its action, its movement, and the illusion will cease; you will be free.
	But then again who is this you?
	If I am really the eternal, then I, the individual do not exist; my real self, to use a desperately foolish
	language, — since that means an individual in possession of a self which cannot be, as my individuality is an
	illusion, — my real self is in eternal bliss and not being affected cannot care whether this false, nonexistently
	existent I is bound or escapes, suffers or is in bliss.
	To whom then does it matter?
	Only to Maya and mind.
	Well, then, it is an affair between Maya and mind, and they can settle it between themselves.
	Precisely, the Illusionist will reply; to you, the mental being, it does matter because you are in Maya, you suffer,
	however phenomenally, however unreally, and the only way to get rid of it is to abolish Maya by abolishing yourself,
	your mental individuality, her<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="73" href="#">2</a> result by which alone she exists; then
	you will not exist, Maya and the world will exist for other mental beings; but you will undergo extinction in the
	Brahman, for you Brahman only will exist.
	How for me, since I can only be either in Maya or out of it, either individually aware of Maya and not of my real
	self or else non-existent individually?
	How can “I” be aware of my real self only and of nothing else?
	It is possible; for as the mind falsely reflects Brahman by Maya as the individual, so free from Maya, it can truly
	reflect Brahman<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="74" href="#">3</a> and it ceases to be individual mind, although in an
	individual body it still seems to be individually released.
	Really, it is Brahman expelling Maya from the consciousness, then the mind is taken up into Samadhi, extinguished in
	Samadhi, and this is the [?prefatory] sign.
	Fix your mind upon that, look at things practically, and do not ask inconsistent questions, as to how there can be
	individual salvation when there is no individual self to be saved.
	These questions do not arise once the release is made, they arise in Maya which is a practical fact and can receive
	only a practical solution.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 217</p>
<p class="P">
	Well that is a kind of answer.
	But how am I to know that it is not an evasion of the difficulty?
	What if I say that really the unmodifiable Brahman is not the highest truth? that the Brahman is aware at once of
	his unmodified eternal self and of his eternally modified cosmic existence, Akshara and Kshara, but he is himself
	beyond both, and that my real way of escape is to be the same, to be aware of my eternal self and of all the
	universe as modifications of my self; that with this transcendence and universality comes perfect bliss, and that
	the fact that I, still existing in Maya, can be blissfully aware of one Self everywhere and of all things in the
	universe is a proof of my assertion?
	This seems to me at least as good a theory as your theory of Maya; and if you say, how is that possible, I can
	either allege reasons or answer like you, it is a supraintellectual fact and we have to take it as a fact and find
	the practical way of realising it.
	If you want me to reject it in favour of your theory, give me at least some help.
	Make me realise how the world can be nonexistently existent, how the unmodifiable can be apparently modified, how I
	can exist only beyond the world and yet exist in it so palpably that I must struggle to get out of it, how Brahman
	exists only beyond Maya and yet by me exists in Maya, how mind is the result of Maya, an instrument to see world and
	is yet capable of getting rid of Maya and seeing only the Brahman, how being by my individuality subject to Maya,
	and only able to escape by getting rid of my individuality, I am yet to become individually aware of Brahman and get
	an individual salvation, while all the rest of the world by which alone I am individual in my experience is still
	subject to it, how an unreal individual can realise Brahman.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Mayavadin answers that as it is the Maya power of the Self which creates the ignorance in each individual, so it
	is the Self in each individual which enables him to have the knowledge by removing from him the Maya power.
	How this can be, can only be explained by analogies.
	As a man mistakes a rope for a snake, and then discovers it is a rope and there is no snake, so the mind thinks
	there is a world where there is only Brahman and discovers in the end that there is only Brahman; — or as a man
	mistakes mother of pearl for real pearl and runs after it and is then disillusioned and leaves it to go after the
	reality.
	As a pot is only a name and form of earth and earth is the only reality, so the world and the individual are only a
	name and form; break the pot, it will go back to its original earth; break the name and form in the consciousness,
	get rid of the individual, and there will be only Brahman in the consciousness.
	There are many golden ornaments, but the reality of them all is the gold; it is that alone which has value.
	So Brahman only is worth having; the rest is name and form and mere vanity.
	Or if these analogies seem to be only physical images not valid for a supraphysical fact, observe how you dream.
	The dream has no reality, yet is real to your consciousness while it lasts.
	The you in the dream is an unreal you; you awake to your real self.
	So the world is a dream; falling asleep to the world, the dream ceases; awake to the Brahman, the dream is convinced
	of unreality.
	That is the only possible and a quite sufficient answer.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 218</p>
<p class="P">
	Is it a sufficient answer?
	Does it prove the main point that the world consciousness is an apparent and unreal modification of the ever
	unmodifiable Brahman and therefore to be dispelled as quickly as possible, so that I may cease to exist, except
	insofar as I already eternally exist, not at all as I, but as the Brahman?
	Above all, does it show that my one practical business is to get rid of a world consciousness which is of no value
	and has no purpose except self-bewilderment, and become again what I ought never to have ceased to be in my unreal
	consciousness, as indeed I am still that in my real consciousness, the featureless and immutable Spirit?
	Is the world really a valueless dream, a purposeless delirium of ignorance?
	Have we no other true spiritual business here except to get out of it?
	These are the real questions that the soul of man asks of the illusionist thinker, and we have to judge his answer.

	God is the beginning, middle and end of all things; but in the beginning He is concealed, in the middle partly and
	progressively manifest, in the end revealed.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The universe is such a manifestation of God under certain conditions and in the terms of a gradually unfolding
	harmony.
	These conditions and the movements which govern the rhythms of the harmony are the universal laws.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 222</p>
<p class="P">
	In this manifestation the two terms are involution and evolution.
	The material universe starts from an involution of God in the movement of inconscient Force and the forms of inert
	Matter and it is impelled by the divine impulse within it to the evolution of God through the increasing
	manifestation of consciousness and conscious power which must culminate in a perfect and infinite self-knowledge,
	self-mastery and self-delight.
	By the involution we mean a self-concealing of the Divine in a descent of which the last rung is Matter, by the
	evolution a self-revealing of the Divine in an ascent of which the last rung is Spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Since evolution or a gradual self-unfolding is the essential movement of the universe, the impulse of all life in
	the universe must be to self-fulfilment and the realisation of its utmost potentialities.
	Behind each form of life there is a divine idea which determines its form and its limits and the form circumscribes
	the potentialities of the life.
	Therefore the self-fulfilment of the life is contained within certain limits fixed by the nature of the life and the
	law of its being and action which that nature determines.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The idea which thus determines is the cause and the form which thus limits the sign of the Finite in the universe.
	The universe is an infinity creating innumerable finite expressions of itself in idea and form within its own
	infinite being.
	The one and infinite is the soul and reality of each finite; the multiple finite is the rhythm, movement and harmony
	of the infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Therefore in and behind all finite life in the universe there is an infinite reality seeking to arrive at itself
	which must in its self-unfolding create finite forms of life which are yet able in their consciousness and movement
	to manifest and realise the infinite.
	Man is such a finite-infinite and the sole type of such a form of life that yet exists upon the earth.

	All life and mind on earth is the story of a Being, a Consciousness, a Power, a Joy that is darkly imprisoned in the
	apparent inconscience of Matter and is struggling for liberation.
	Blinded, cabined, drugged, immured, it is yet ever striving to come out of the black cell of this obscurity into its
	own light, wideness, conscious sight and force, self-aware action, bliss, freedom, harmony, perfection.
	It starts with small beginnings, as a vibration in the metal, as a feeling out and drawing in and a groping and [?
	infusing] in the plant, as a crude or minute power of sensory life-urge rising to an instinctive reason and mind and
	purposeful force in the insect, as a more organised and conscious and emotional, even a roughly and narrowly
	thinking and planning vital being in the animal, and has persevered till it has broken into some half opening on
	itself in the thinking, reasoning, willing and aspiring nature of man, the Manu, the mental creature.
	Here at present it stands not by any means satisfied, but it would seem, feeling out for something more entirely
	itself, some supreme manhood or supermanhood, some beginning of godhead that would be at last its true self-finding
	and triumphant manifestation out of matter, even here in this limited and limiting earthly Nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This striving and slow outburst of Something that was hidden all along in Matter, in the Inconscient, is the whole
	sense of Evolution — not the mere development of a more and more organised living body out of protoplasm, as the
	scientists with their eyes fixed only or mainly on physical things would have it, but the struggle of Consciousness
	somnambulised in Matter to wake and free, find and possess itself more and more completely, the emancipation and
	slow self-revealing of a Soul secret at first in Force and Form, the growth of a Spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This evolution, it is sometimes pretended, ends in man, man is the term and end; but this is because we miss the
	real values of the process.
	At first indeed we see this Spirit spending numberless millions of years to evolve a material system of worlds empty
	in the beginning of life, a lesser but vast enough series of millions to develop an earth on which life can inhabit,
	a lesser series of millions to make possible and train, raise life itself with but a feeble and restricted apparatus
	of mind; but once it has found a body, a brain, a living apparatus not perfect, but still sufficient it is no longer
	concerned mainly with evolving a body or [ . . . ] an embodied life but can at last grapple with its own proper
	business.
	Evolution henceforth means the evolution of the consciousness, of mind and, if any such thing there be, of what is
	beyond mind, — and in that case as its last stride has been the evolution of the mental being, man, out of the vital
	being, the animal, so its next stride will be to evolve out of mental man a greater spiritual and supramental
	creature.

	All mind and life on earth are the progressive manifestation of a Spirit or Being that has involved itself in Matter
	and is slowly evolving in Matter, against the inconscient resistance of a first rigid material self-formation and
	under its conditions, its own secret powers and nature.
	In the Inconscience in which it has involved itself, these powers, this nature seem not only to be hidden but
	contradicted; cast into their own opposites they emerge with difficulty and labour at first in flickers and faint
	glimpses, then growing into a better but still much diminished figure.
	But the evolution cannot be considered at an end until these diminished figures growing more and more free,
	developed, powerful arrive at their own complete fulfilment, revelation of their truth, native perfection, beauty
	and greatness.
	This is the aim of terrestrial existence — to reveal in Matter, in Time-Space, in figure and body what was once
	self-held only in an eternal unembodied self and spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In order that this evolution might be, an implacable plunge of supreme Consciousness and Being into an apparent void
	of insentience, inconscience, non-existence was inevitable; for without that plunge, immergence, seeming yet
	effective annihilation [in] its opposite the creation of that phenomenon of cosmic Energy which we call Matter would
	have been impossible.
	Yet however effective this appearance is only an appearance.
	In the void of that Non-Existence all the powers of being are held involved and latent; in the impenetrable darkness
	of that Inconscience all the possibilities of consciousness lie ready to be evolved; in that insentience is a
	drowned Delight of Existence which emerging in the contradictory figures of pleasure and pain can struggle upwards
	towards cosmic expression of its own truth of the Bliss that supports all things.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 225</p>
<p class="P">
	To ask why this plunge was taken at all, why such an evolution slow, gratuitous, painful should ever have been
	undertaken is natural for man struggling painfully with his own transience, ignorance and suffering — inevitable
	consequences of that plunge or fall — but from the cosmic point of view irrelevant and otiose.
	A possibility was there in the Infinite and outlined itself for manifestation, the lines of an evolutionary world
	amidst the numberless possibility or numbered reality of various universes, and it was undertaken because the Spirit
	in things is afraid of no possibility of itself but is rather ready to sanction all by its will towards manifest
	existence.
	To the Cosmic Spirit which sees things as a whole, the working out of this universe or any universe is
	self-justified, the obscure labour of the emergence no less than the glory of its completion and final perfection in
	a yet unattained light, bliss and greatness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	At any rate into this world of evolution something of the eternal spirit has thrown itself, with all in it that
	consented to the descent and to fulfil the world, not to escape from it, is the deepest meaning of the Spirit and
	Godhead within us and the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This then must be our will in terrestrial existence — being mind in matter to grow into the Spirit, being man-animal
	to emerge into the Godhead, to expand out of our limited sense of existence into freedom and infinite wideness, out
	of the half figure of consciousness we have realised to be illumined into true consciousness, out of weakness to
	realise divine Mastery, out of the dual experience of pain and pleasure to emerge into possession of the cosmic
	Bliss of existence, out of the dull chrysalis of our limited selves to flower into oneness with the Divine Self that
	we are.
	For this is not an egoistic will in us but the meaning of the Divine Inhabitant for which he has undertaken bodily
	life and terrestrial existence.

	Before there could be any evolution, there must needs be an involution of the Divine All that is to emerge.
	Otherwise there would be not an evolution, but a successive creation of things new, not contained in their
	antecedents, not their inevitable consequences or followers in a sequence but arbitrarily willed or miraculously
	conceived by an inexplicable Chance, a stumblingly fortunate Force or an external Creator.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The long process of terrestrial formation and creation, the ambiguous miracle of life, the struggle of mind to
	appear and grow in an apparent vast Ignorance and to reign there as interpreter and creator and master, the
	intimations of a greater something that passes beyond the finite marvel of mind to the infinite marvels of the
	Spirit, are not a meaningless and fortuitous passing result of some cosmic Chance with its huge combination of
	coincidences; they are not the lucky play of some blind material Force.
	These things are and can be only because of something eternal and divine that concealed itself in energy and form of
	Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The secret of the terrestrial evolution is the slow and progressive liberation of this latent indwelling spirit, the
	difficult appearance, the tardy becoming [of a] divine Something or Someone already involved with all its potential
	forces in a first formal basis of supporting substance, its greater slowly emerging movements locked up in one
	initial expressive power of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man the thinker and seeker would not be here if he were not an embodied portion of an all-conscious Infinite that is
	superconscient above him but lies also hidden in the inconscience of the material universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The development of forms is not the most important or the most significant part of the evolutionary process; it is
	one sign of the thing that is being done, but it is not its essence.
	Material form is only a support and means for the progressive manifestation of the Spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If all were chance or play of inconscient or inconsequent Force, there would be no reason why man with all his
	imperfections should not be the last word of this feat of unconscious intelligence or this haphazard miracle.
	It is because the Divine Spirit is there and his manifestation the meaning of the movement that a new power must
	emerge in the series that started from Matter.

	The material universe would be a waste if wonderful desert if Life had not appeared as the first index to some
	marvellous utility and an ultimate profound and moving significance.
	But life too by itself would be a movement without sequence to its purposeful initiation or any light to its own
	mystery if in Life there were not concealed an interpretative or at least a seeking power of consciousness that
	could turn upon its powers and try to grasp and direct them towards their own realised issue.

	For things are what they are, but not what they were; they cannot remain for ever what they are, but must grow into
	what they can be and shall be.
	And what they shall be can be nothing less than the exceeding of their present imperfection, the fullness of what
	they have only half become; but it may and must be something more than that, they must grow into their own concealed
	reality, their nature must reveal what is now concealed, their real self.
</p>
<p class="P">The perfection of species or of types is not what is aimed at; the type is often perfect [within its]
	limits, for it is the limits that make the type; the species too can be perfect in itself, perfect in its own

	see in Nature is that it strives ever to exceed itself, to go beyond what it has yet done. For having achieved in
	the animal the whole of which animality was capable, it did not in achieving man endeavour to produce the perfect
	synthetic animal, it began at once working out something more than the animal. Man is to a certain extent a
	synthesis of several animals; he might even be said to synthetise all, from the worm and the skink, to the elephant
	and the lion; but as an animal he is terribly imperfect. His greatness lies in his being more than an animal and by
	this new nature he has exceeded the animal and made up for all his deficiencies even in the region of the struggle
	for life. Comparatively defenceless at first, he has become the master of the earth; he is not merely <em>primus

	This consciousness is a temporary phenomenon beginning in each form with birth and ending with death of the body.
	Consciousness then is a circumstance of body and incapable of survival of the body.
	There is no such thing per se as consciousness.
	A consciousness not dependent on the body, expressing itself in it as its instrument, a soul or spirit, is therefore
	a myth, an imagination; if it existed, it would be an unwarrantable intrusion into the nature of things as seen in

	circumstance or result of Matter and returns to Matter, soul too would be a circumstance or result of Matter, would
	act by it and in it only, would return finally to Matter.
	Consciousness itself is a phenomenon of Matter, is nothing but Matter in action, a combination of phenomenal action
	of chemical or other physical entities and operations and can be nothing else.
	It is unproven and unprovable, — though it may be that it is also not disproved and not disprovable.

	Reality is beyond its grasp, it is only sure about the appearance.

	If man's knowledge and his way of knowledge are imperfect, still more imperfect are his living and his doing.
	[His] works sometimes attain perfection.
	Some men have done well in poetry and the arts and crafts, more have done badly, most are conventional copyists or
	botchers.
	In science and works with a scientific basis, men have certainly done well and their works were often efficient or
	masterly, for there all is method and rule and there the human mind seeks to master and execute what he has to do
	and that he can always do.
	Few have insight in works, fewer have any originality.
	Journeyman's work he can do, for man is essentially a journeyman.
	He is skilful in putting things [up], buildings, a job, a swindle.
	In pulling down he is perfect, a destroyer ne plus ultra.
	The world is full of his constructions, but more pervasive is his destruction; but that leaves few traces.
	But still the great doers are few in number, the good doers are many, the poor doers are legion, the evil doers
	hardly less.

	Human society is a ramshackle affair; it is top-heavy, over-elaborate and opulent at the top, below a multitudinous

	There are two states of being, two levels or limits between which all existence stands or moves, a highest limit of
	supreme consciousness, an omniscient Superconscience, a nethermost limit of supreme unconsciousness, an omnipotent
	Inconscience.
	The secret of consciousness reveals itself only when we perceive these two limits and the movement between them
	which we call the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There can be no consciousness without existence, for the consciousness of a Void or a Nihil is a vain imagination, a
	thing impossible.
	For Nothing cannot be conscious of anything — cannot be conscious of itself; if it were conscious of itself, it
	would at once be an existence aware of itself, it would cease to be a Nihil; it would at once be evident that it was
	all the time an Existence appearing to be Nihil, that it was Being or a Being unconscious, but now grown conscious
	of its own existence.
	A void conscious of itself is conceivable, but it would then be a void existence and not Nihil.
	There might be an eternal Non-Being, but that too could not be Nihil; eventually it could only be a supreme
	superconscient existence exceeding our notion of Being.
	A true Nihil would necessarily be as incapable of consciousness as of existence; out of it nothing could come as in
	it nothing could be, neither spirit nor soul nor mind nor Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">We have then at one end of things a supreme superconscient existence and [at the other] a supreme
	inconscient existence and between them we have consciousness in the universe; but both are two states of one Being;

	All existence upon earth is an evolution of what has come down from a superconscious Eternity to be involved here in
	a subconscious Infinite.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="79" href="#">1</a>
</p>
<p class="P">
	That Eternity and this Infinite are the same Essence in opposite powers, but the one appears as a dark shadow of the
	other.
	The Superconscient is hidden from us because it is wrapped in its own being of illimitable light; the Inconscient
	escapes our search because it is plunged in its own veil of impenetrable darkness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All that manifested from the Eternal has already been arranged in worlds or planes of its own nature, planes of
	subtle Matter, planes of Life, planes of Mind, planes of Supermind, planes of the triune luminous Infinite.
	But these worlds or planes are not evolutionary but typal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A typal world is one in which some ruling principle manifests itself in its free and full capacity and energy and
	form are plastic and subservient to its purpose.
	Its expressions are therefore automatic and satisfying and do not need to evolve; they stand so long as need be and
	do not need to be born, develop, decline and disintegrate.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 237</p>
<p class="P">
	For evolution to be necessary there must be an opposing medium or recalcitrant instruments or an involution of the
	thing in its opposite.
	This is what has happened in the terrestrial world.
	Spirit has to evolve out of matter, consciousness out of the Inconscient, life out of inanimation, mind out of a
	life that is void of thought; out of mind and its fragmentation and difficult piecing together of things the
	automatic completeness of the supramental knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There is a secret self-compulsion in the Inconscient to manifest what is involved — gaoled, suppressed and inactive
	within it, but also there is a stupendous Inertia, as of some fathomless cosmic sleep, that resists the will to
	manifest and retards the evolution.
	There is thus an upward levitation towards the luminous eternity of the Spirit strongly countered by a downward
	gravitation back towards the Inconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This Inertia was needed in order that the evolution might be gradual by aeonic process and not an explosion of the
	concealed elements either into a rapid self-ordered typal series or into their original superconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	As a consequence of this retarding force what is involved evolves with difficulty and slowly.
	Evolution is a struggle between an insistent call to manifestation and an iron retardatory reluctant Inertia.
	Evolutionary existence is precarious because the downward gravitation back to its source contradicts powerfully both
	the stress from within towards permanence and the pull from above towards self-transcendence.
	Matter in our world can easily dissolve into its elements, life sink back into death, mind relapse into
	unconsciousness.
	A type evolved, animal or man, struggles<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="80" href="#">2</a> slowly and with much
	difficulty into manifestation, it is less difficult for it to disappear, as disappeared the mastodon and the
	dinosaurus.
	Hence the law of a precarious impermanence laid on the forms of Matter which is corrected only for a time by the
	lavish will to reproduction in Nature.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 238</p>
<p class="P">
	As the evolution is from the Inconscient, it is not only a precarious but also an ignorant movement feeling its way
	rather than consciously finding it.
	But still its most significant term is a growing consciousness which must at last emerge out of ignorance into
	knowledge.
	When that happens, the evolution will become a willed and conscious movement, aware of its process and its way, no
	longer a stumbling search or a precarious growth but a luminous outflowering of the Divine.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="81" href="#">3</a>
</p>
<p class="P">
	The call to manifestation is composed of a double current of Force moving between two poles.
	There is a will or at least an urge in the Inconscient itself, slow, dumb, obscure but imperative and inevitable
	towards the revelation of its involved contents.
	But there is also a pressure from above from the already established Powers for their manifestation in Space-Time
	here and for their evolutionary possibilities in the world of Matter.
	A world of subtle Matter presses on the shapeless Inconscient for the manifestation of forms; a world of essential
	Life presses on form of Matter for the manifestation of an embodied life; a world of essential Mind presses on
	animate life for the manifestation of mind in the living body.
	This compulsion is so great as to contradict and counteract finally the refusing and retarding Inertia.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Above on the summits of existence is all that is beyond Mind and all that is the complete splendour of the Spirit.
	These too wait for their hour of manifestation, their turn for revelation in Time and Space and the evolving series

	All existence upon earth is an evolution of what has come down from a superconscious Eternity to be involved here in
	a subconscious Infinite.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 239</p>
<p class="P">
	The superconscious Eternity to which we tend and the subconscious Infinite from which we rise — for we are a part of
	both and we stand between them as their developing link — are opposite powers of the same Being, are indeed, in
	their essence, one and the same Being; but one appears to our experience as a dark and void shadow of the other.
	The Superconscient is hidden from us because it is wrapped in its own being of illimitable light; the Inconscient
	escapes our search because it is plunged in its own veil of impenetrable darkness.
</p>
<p class="P">What comes down from the Superconscient is self, spirit, the wide and all-containing Essence of the eternal
	existence. It plunges, carrying its powers in it, into an infinite ocean of inconscience, <em>apraketam
		salilam</em>, and hides itself there. It hides itself and its powers from itself—it appears in us as its own
	opposite.</p>
<p class="P">
	The Self is an immortal and unseizable essence and substance of all things, it is a pure omnipresent omniscient
	omnipotent existence.
	It appears to our experience when we emerge from the subconscient as a mysterious Void or Nihil, indeterminable yet
	from it all things and forms are, inconscient yet flowering into consciousness, inert yet manifesting enormous
	energies, lifeless yet the parent of life, insensible yet a fountain of pain and pleasure.
	This impossibility, this universal contradiction is unreal and born of our ignorance; yet that ignorance is not
	ours, but a result of the inconscience which was imposed on itself as a veil by the involved Self and Spirit.
	For if that Inconscience were not there, the evolutionary emergence of the Self which is the law and object of this
	universe would not have been possible; all would have flowered into a manifestation too immediate, too irresistibly
	powerful in its process, too absolute.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 240</p>
<p class="P">
	The Self, the Spirit is a pure existence, a spiritual substance that is self-aware and therefore all-aware.
	It is in its nature an absolute and omniscient consciousness, eternally comprehending all itself, all in itself and
	would naturally manifest as an absolute, unwalled, indivisible knowledge.
	It becomes an inconscience out of which consciousness struggles brokenly into light, seeking and groping for itself,
	groping after signs and intimations of its substance, but finding at first only fragmentary signs and separated
	forms and objects which seem not itself.
	The consciousness in the individualised form becomes aware of itself by the shock of things outside that are or seem
	to be not itself.
	It becomes aware of itself as a separated form and only when it grows more and more deeply self-conscious slowly
	becomes aware of all outside it as part of its own continuous indivisible existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The nature of the Spirit's consciousness is a self-existent Force which in action becomes a spontaneously
	self-manifesting or, as it seems to us, self-creating and self-determining energy.
	It is omnisciently omnipotent and creates out of itself what it wills under whatever conditions it wills — for its
	will is that of an infinite and infinitely variable self-aware oneness whose steps, no matter what they are, are by
	necessity the movement of a perfect Truth and Knowledge.
	But it is by an equal necessity the very opposite when the manifestation of the Substance of things becomes the
	working of a void Inconscience.
	For even if that Inconscience be only apparent because an all-knowledge and its force are hidden there, yet this
	error, this phenomenon of Inconscience is and was intended to be dynamic and operative.
	In other words, all had to look and appear as the gropings of an Inconscience whose results in their upshot were yet
	those of an ordered and imperative Intelligence.
	An inert Soul guiding with a strange and blind sureness the steps of a somnambulist Nature would be no inadequate
	image of the apparent Spirit of this material universe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 241</p>
<p class="P">
	This material world sprung from the subconscious Infinite appears to us as if [it] were the sole actual universe and
	even perhaps the only creation possible.
	But that is because we are limited by our senses which we now know to be restricted in their field and even there
	fallible.
	The material senses by their very nature can perceive only material things and from that our still infantile
	external reason infers that only material things exist and there is nothing else.
	All forms that are immaterial or of another substance than ours are and cannot but be illusions, hallucinations,
	unreal images.
	But a being otherwise constituted in consciousness or sense could well see this world in other figures than present
	themselves to ours.
	Another would see perhaps other worlds made of another, a subtler material or an essentially mental or vital or
	spiritual substance.
	A world is only an arrangement of things as experienced by consciousness of the Spirit and this consciousness can
	see all kinds of things in all kinds of ways according to whatever plane of itself, whatever medium and whatever
	instruments it has produced for its cosmic purpose.
	We shall understand nothing of existence if we confine our vision to the particular view of things our primary
	consciousness and its instruments which are physical impose upon us; for this consciousness is only a surface
	phenomenon of ourselves and our total being is far deeper, higher and vaster than that, our possibilities extend
	infinitely beyond their present limit, and the world also is far more complex than the first crude inexplicable
	mystery of Matter would lead us to imagine.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The immense material world in which we live is not the sole reality but only one of innumerable potential and
	existent universes; all of them need not have either Matter as we know it or the Inconscient for their base.
	Indeed this world of matter is itself dependent on many planes of consciousness and existence which are not
	material; for these have not this gross substance as their foundation or as the medium of their instrumentation of
	energy and consciousness or their primary condition of existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All the powers that are involved here in the inconscient Infinite and that we see rising out of it, — mind, life and
	what is beyond mind no less than matter itself — have their previous existence and are not merely evolutionary
	results of Nature in this universe.
	They have not only a preexistence but also their separate planes of manifestation in which each in turn is, as
	matter is here, the foundation, the medium of instrumentation, the primary condition of existence.

	All terrestrial existence is the slow surge of a hidden Consciousness mounting up out of an apparent Inconscience

<p class="pg-num">Page 242</p>

	There is a spirit secret even in things immobile, — there is an All-Consciousness disguised in the Inconscient.
	In Matter life is embedded, in Life is an enveloped mind, in Mind is concealed a greater supramental and spiritual
	being not yet manifested.
	These are the significant and illumining terms of the riddle.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Evolution is the labour of Nature, or let us say at once of the Energy of the secret Spirit, working in the
	semblance and under the limiting conditions of an inconscient Power to release these latencies each in its turn out
	of their involution in the original Inconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is an All-consciousness that is working, the force of a self-aware cosmic Spirit, and the emergence of its secret
	powers is implied in the very nature of existence; therefore the result is inevitable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Science has discovered a physical evolution hidden in the past history of the earth of which the living record
	remains in the embryo; but the physical evolution is only an outward sign, means and material condition of a still
	more secret evolution.
	A spiritual evolution, an evolution of consciousness is the inner fact which alone illumines the problem of earth
	existence and opens to it its true solution; apart from it our life here has no intelligible significance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Ancient Indian thought discovered an evolution from birth to birth, from the life of tree and plant to the life of
	insect and animal, from the life of the animal to the life of man, attained with difficulty through the ages.
	This slowly attained human life it took to be the key of release from the baffling circle of the enigma.
	After some eighty and more lakhs of births, says the Tantra, a soul reaches the human form and consciousness and
	sooner or later finds the secret of escape from birth in time into the birthless and deathless Eternity from which
	it came.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 243</p>
<p class="P">
	These two discoveries seem at first sight quite unconnected and disparate.
	In one it is a physical Life in the cosmos that evolves and the individual is only an ephemeral member of the
	species, the species a means of this cosmic evolution.
	Mind is indeed the term and the mental human being the crown of this inexplicable emergence; when human progress is
	over, when the race decays and perishes, the cosmic evolution will be at an end, for it has nothing more then it can
	do.
	In man it has shot its bolt; nothing more is possible.
	Consciousness emerging out of the Inconscient has achieved this shoddy and splendid, this winging and limping
	miracle of the ever-seeking creative Mind of Man and sinks back into the Inconscient; its emergence had no
	discoverable significance, its brief play and cessation make no difference to the meaningless rounds of an
	inconscient universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In the Indian view it is the individual that evolves from birth to birth and the hierarchy of the vegetal, animal,
	human kinds [is] a fixed unchanging ladder for its ascent.
	A successive creation of higher and higher species is envisaged in the Upanishads as well as the Puranas and
	heredity affirmed as a means of conscious continuity of the human embodiment of the Spirit, but still the evolution
	is individual and not cosmic, spiritual not physical.
	Yet here too this persistent phenomenon of spiritual embodiment appearing from the bodiless Spirit and evolving back
	into the bodiless Spirit seems to be devoid of significance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If stripped of their limitations the two discoveries can be regarded as complementary rather than disparate.
	There is evidently an evolution; Matter first manifests out of the Formless — inanimate in appearance; in Matter
	life manifests unconscious in appearance; in life mind manifests in the animal but instinctive and irrational in
	appearance; in life-mind thinking mind appears rational but yet self-ignorant in appearance, — for it seeks to know
	but yet does not know the secret and significance of its own existence.
	It is not yet undisputed but it is affirmed that in thinking man spirit is moving towards manifestation, spirit
	aware of itself and of its own secret and significance.
	Thus far at least an evolution is indisputable and we may affirm without hesitation that there is a cosmic Existence
	here which first achieves a material manifestation of itself or a manifestation in itself, a material formula, then
	on that basis a life formulation, a vital formula, on that again a mental formulation, a mind formula.
	It is possible that on that again it is preparing a spiritual formulation of self-affirmation and self-knowledge
	which will complete the emergence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 244</p>
<p class="P">
	There is also very evidently an evolution of forms, generic and individual in the genus and species, which enables
	the formulation to be effective, each in its own kind, organised so as to express more and more definite and
	superior possibilities of matter, more and more definite and superior possibilities of life, more and more definite
	and superior possibilities of mind, — more than this cannot yet be positively asserted, but this much is
	asseverable.
	If we can add that in the mental formula, in the mentalised life and body of man, a spiritual emergence is in
	process which has not yet reached its full possibility and that possibility is the emergence of the spiritual man or
	supramental being, then the object of the physical evolution and its significance becomes clear.
	The evolution of bodies is only a means for the evolution of consciousness and the spiritual formulation will be
	that in which the cosmic Existence will find its own full affirmation, manifest through the original veil of Matter
	its self-awareness, self-knowledge, self-realisation.
	The Cosmic Spirit hidden in the Inconscience is then the Alpha, its manifestation in the consciousness of
	spiritualised man the Omega.

	The history of the earth is first an evolution of organised forms by the working of material forces.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 247</p>
<p class="P">
	There follows on this initial stage an evolution of life in the form and an organisation of a hierarchy of living
	forms by the working of liberated life-forces.
	The next step is an evolution of mind in living bodies and an organisation of more and more conscious lives by the
	process of developing mind forces.
	But even this is not the end; for there are higher powers of consciousness beyond mind which await their turn and
	must have their act in the great play, their part of the creative Lila.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Matter, the medium of all this evolution, is seemingly inconscient and inanimate; but it so appears to us only
	because we are unable to sense consciousness outside a certain limited range, a fixed scale or gamut to which we
	have access.
	Below us there are lower ranges to which we are insensible and these we call subconscience or inconscience.
	Above us are higher ranges which are to our inferior nature an unseizable superconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The difficulty of Matter is not an absolute inconscience but an obscured consciousness limited by its own movement,
	vaguely, dumbly, blindly self-aware, only mechanically responsive to anything outside its own form and force.
	At its worst it can be called not so much inconscience as nescience.
	The awakening of a greater and yet greater consciousness in this Nescience is the miracle of the universe of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This nescience of Matter is a veiled, an involved or a somnambulist consciousness which contains all the latent
	powers of the Spirit.
	In every particle, atom, molecule, cell of Matter there lives<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="83" href="#">1</a> hidden
	and works unknown all the omniscience of the Eternal and all the omnipotence of the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The evolution of forms and powers by which Matter will become more and more conscious until passing beyond form and
	life and mind it becomes aware with the supernal awareness of the eternal and infinite Spirit in his own highest
	ranges, this is the meaning of earth existence.
	The slow self-manifesting birth of God in Matter is the purpose of the terrestrial Lila.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>

<p class="P">
	Matter is at once a force and a substance.
	Matter is original being, Brahman made concrete in atomic division; Matter is original substance-force,
	Brahman-Shakti made active in an obscure involution of the spirit's powers, in a self-forgetful nescience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Matter-force casts matter-substance, material Shakti casts Matter-Brahman into form expressive of its own most
	characteristic powers.
	When that has been done, the physical world is ready for the splendid intrusion of conscious Life into the
	force-driven inertia of material substance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Matter is not the only force, nor the only substance.
	For Life and Mind too and what is beyond Mind are also forces that are substances but of another kind and degree.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Spirit is the original force-substance; all these others are kinds and derivations of force of spirit, degrees and
	modifications [of] substance of spirit.
	Matter too is nothing but a power and degree of the spirit; Matter too is substance of the Eternal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the Matter that we see and sense is only an outermost sheath and coating; behind it are other subtler degrees of
	physical substance which are less dense with the atomic nescience and it is easier for Life and Mind to enter into
	them and operate.
	If finer invisible physical layers or couches did not exist supporting this gross visible physical world, that world
	could not abide; for then the fine operations of transmission between Spirit and Matter [could not] be executed at
	all and it is these that render the grosser visible operations possible.
	The evolution would be impossible; life and mind and beyond-mind would be unable to manifest in the material
	universe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 249</p>
<p class="P">
	There is not only this material plane of being that we see, there is a physical life plane proper to the vital
	physical operation of Nature.
	There is a physical mind plane proper to a mental physical operation of Nature.
	There is a physical supermind plane proper to the supramental physical operation of Nature.
	There is too a plane of physical spirit power or infinite physical Being-Consciousness-Force-Bliss proper to the
	spiritual physical operations of Nature.
	It is only when we have discovered and separated these planes of Nature and of our physical being and analysed the
	synthesis of their contributions to the whole play that we shall discover how the evolution of vital, mental and
	spiritual consciousness became possible in inconscient Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But there is more; for beyond these many couches of the physical existence are other supraphysical degrees, a many
	layered plane of Life, a many layered plane of Mind, planes of Supermind, of Bliss, of Consciousness Force and of
	infinite Being on which the physical existence depends for its origination and its continuance.
	It is higher planes that flood the constantly unfolding unseen energies which have raised its evolution from the
	obscurity in which it began to the splendour of a light of consciousness to which the highest human mind shall only
	be the feeble glimmer of a glowworm fire before the sun in its flaming glories.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There is a stupendous hierarchy of grades of consciousness between darkest Matter and most luminous spirit.
	Consciousness in Matter has to go on climbing to the very top of the series and return with all it has to give us
	before the evolution can utterly fulfil its purpose.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Matter, Life, Mind, Supermind or Gnosis, and beyond these the quadruple power of a supreme
	Being-Consciousness-Force-Bliss — these are the grades of the evolutionary ascent from inconscience to the
	Superconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Life does not wholly come into the earth from outside it; its principle is there always in material things.
	But, imprisoned in the apparent inanimate inertia or blind force movement of Matter, it is bound by its movements
	and unable to manifest its own independent or dominant existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 250</p>
<p class="P">
	Life is there in the earth, rock, metal, gas, atom, electron and the other more subtle yet undiscovered forces and
	particles that constitute material energy and form.
	It is in everything, but at first a hardly detectable presence organised only to support secretly material energies,
	processes, formations and transformations; it is there as an involved power for the building and expression of Form
	of Matter, not for the expression of Life.
	It is not in possession of itself, not self-conscious in the form, not pushed towards self-manifestation; a helpless
	tool and instrument, not a free agent, it is a servant of Matter and a slave of the Form, not the master of the
	house.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But above the material world there is a plane of dominant Life that presses down upon this material universe and
	seeks to pour into it whatever it can of its own types, powers, forces, impulsions, manifesting creative godheads.
	When in the material world form is ready, the Gods and Life-Daemons of this higher plane are attracted to put their
	creative touch upon Matter.
	Then there comes a rapid and sudden efflorescence of Life; the plant, the animalcule, the insect, the animal appear.
	A Life-Soul and a Life-Force with its many and always more complex movements are manifested in what seemed once to
	be inert and inanimate substance.
	Life souls, life minds, animal existences are born and evolve; a new world appears that is born and contained in
	this world of Matter and yet surpasses it in its own dynamic nature.

	At each capital step of Nature's ascent there is a reversal of consciousness in the evolving spirit.
	As when a climber turns on a summit to which he has laboured and looks down with an exalted and wider power of
	vision on all that was once above or on a level with him but is now below his feet, the evolutionary being not only
	transcends his past self, his former now exceeded status, but commands from a higher grade of self-experience and
	vision, with a new apprehending feeling or a new comprehending sight and effectuating power, in a greater system of
	values, all that was once his own consciousness but is now below his tops and belongs to an inferior creation.
	This reversal is the sign of a decisive victory and the seal of a radical progress in Nature.
	The new consciousness attained in the spiritual evolution is always higher in grade and power, always larger, more
	comprehensive, wider in sight and feeling, richer and finer in faculties, more complex, organic, dominating than the
	consciousness that was once our own but is now left behind us.
	There are greater breadths and spaces,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="84" href="#">1</a> heights before impossible,

	There is a luminous expansion that is the very sign manual of the Supreme upon his work.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">2</a>

	Mark too that each of the great radical steps forward already taken by Nature has been infinitely greater in its
	change, incalculably vaster in its consequences than its puny predecessor.
	There is a miraculous opening to an always richer and wider expression, there is a new illuminating of the creation
	and a dynamic heightening of its significances.
	There is in this world we live in no equality of all on a flat level, but a hierarchy of ever-increasing precipitous
	superiorities pushing their mountain-shoulders upwards towards the Supreme.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Plant-life is a most significant progress upon the mineral, but the difference is as nothing compared with the gulf
	that divides the dumb vitality of the plant from the conscious experience of the animal.
	The hiatus between the animal and the human is so great in consciousness, however physically small, that the
	scientists' alleged cousinship of monkey and man looks psychologically almost incredible.
	And yet the difference between vital animal and mental man is as nothing to that which will be between man's mind
	and the superman's vaster consciousness and richer powers.
	That past step will be to this new one as the snail's slow march in the grass to a Titan's sudden thousand league
	stride from continent to continent.

<p class="P">
	Evolution on the terrestrial plane, even in the dullest brute matter is only in outward appearance a progression of
	physical function and form; in its essential fact, in its inner meaning, in its significant power, it is a
	progression of consciousness, a spiritual or psychological change.
</p>
<p class="P">
	At each step the spirit heightens its stature, perfects its instruments, organises better its self-expression; a new
	consciousness comes in, takes up the old and gives it an extended movement and another significance, adds greater,
	richer, more complex movements of which the first formulation was incapable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In the sub-vegetal world all movements, all stimulus, all reaction are of a material and if dynamic, of a
	mechanically dynamic character.
	Even the life movements that exist there, as in the mineral, are of the most rigidly automatic, unindividualised and
	mechanical and external nature, birth, formation, fatigue, sleep, death.
	Mental or psychic powers and significances there are, as an occult knowledge discovers, but of these the form seems
	not aware; it is something behind the life of the mineral, a consciousness supporting rather than inhabiting it,
	using but not used by it, that is their possessor.

	But what shall be the gain won for the earth-consciousness we embody by this unprecedented ascent out of mind to
	whatever may be beyond it and what the significance of the supramental change?
	To what end shall man leave his safe human limits for this godlike but hazardous adventure?
</p>
<p class="P">
	First consider what was gained when earthly Nature passed from the brute inconscience and inertia of the first
	organised forms in what seems to us inanimate Matter to the vibrant sensibility of the plant range.
	Life was gained; the gain was the beginning of the mute groping and involved consciousness that reaches out to
	growth, to sense-vibration, to waking and sleep, to hunger and thirst, to physical pain and pleasure, to a
	preparation for vital yearnings and a living joy and beauty.
	That was begun which still is unfinished — the first step towards a conscious consciousness and what shall yet be
	the divine Ananda.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86-1" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P">
	In the plant earth-nature achieved a first figure of life, but the creature she made could not possess it, because
	this first organised life-consciousness had feeling and seeking, woke and slept, hungered and was satisfied,
	thirsted and drank and grew and flourished, had pleasure of some contacts and suffered from others, but was still
	externally blind, dumb, deaf, chained to the soil from which it was born, involved in its own nerve and tissue.
	It could not get out of this primitive formula, could not get behind its nerve-self as does the vital mind of the
	animal, still less could turn down from above it to know and realise its own motions as does the thinking and
	observing mind of man and to control them.
	This was a decisive but an imprisoned gain; for there was still a gross oppression of the original Inconscience
	which had covered up with the brute phenomenon of Matter and energy of Matter all signs of the Spirit.
	Nature could nowise stop here, because she held so much in her that was still occult, potential, unexpressed,
	unorganised, suppressed, latent; the evolution had perforce to go farther.
	The animal had to replace the plant at the head and top of Nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	And what then was gained when Nature passed from the obscurity of the plant kingdom to the awakened sense and desire
	and emotion and the free mobility of animal life?
	The gain was liberated sense and feeling and desire and courage and cunning and the contrivance of the objects of
	desire, passion and action and hunger and battle and conquest and the sex-call and play and pleasure, and all the
	joy and pain of the conscious living creature.
	Not only the life of the body which the animal has in common with the plant but a life-mind that appeared for the
	first time in the earth-story and grew and grew from form to more organised form till it reached in the best the
	limit of its own formula.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The animal achieved a first form of mind, but could not possess it, because this first organised mind consciousness
	was enslaved in a narrow scope, tied to the first functionings of the physical body and brain and nerve, tied to
	serve the physical life and its desires and needs and passions, limited to the insistent uses of the vital urge, to
	natural longing and feeling and action, bound by its own inferior instrumentation, its spontaneous combinings of
	association and memory and instinct.
	It could not get away from them, could not get behind them as man's intelligence gets behind them to observe them;
	still less could it turn down on them from above as do human reason and will to control, enlarge, reorder, exceed,
	sublimate.

	Cease inwardly from thought and word, be motionless within you, look upward into the light and outward into the vast

	The Titans and the Demons will speak to it more readily than the divine Voices.

<p class="P">
	Silence is indispensable, but also there is needed wideness.
	If the mind is not silent, it cannot receive the lights and voices of the supernal Truth or receiving mixes with
	them its own flickering tongues and blind pretentious babble.
	Active, arrogant, noisy, it distorts and disfigures what it receives.
	If it is not wide, it cannot house the effective power and creative force of the Truth.
	Some light may play there but it becomes narrow, confined and sterile.
	Or the force that is descending is cabined and thwarted and withdraws again from this rebellious foreign plane to
	its vast native heights.
	Or even if something comes down and remains, it is a pearl in the mire; for no change takes place in the nature or
	else there is formed only a thin intensity that points narrowly upward to the summits but can hold little and

	different to other senses than ours; our mind builds the great mass of its idea of the world and things on this
	insecure basis, or if it corrects the evidence of the senses, it is in the light of a reason whose conceptions of
	Time, Space and Substance are equally imperfect, equally relative, empirically valid up to a certain point, but
	fundamentally dubious and insecure.
	Is not this the only consciousness possible, or at least the highest of which we are capable and have we any
	evidence of a higher power of awareness and knowledge or any ground to suppose that there are beings greater than
	man who possess it?
	Is not this world and must it not be always a world of Ignorance, knowledge partial at the best, all knowledge here
	relative, pragmatic, indirect and no knowledge either here or anywhere that can be called supreme, direct or
	absolute?
	If absolute knowledge there is it must be the sheer consciousness of the Featureless Infinite, the One Self, the
	void or formless Spirit, and there can be no other.

	I mean by the supermind a power, a level, an organisation of consciousness which is not only above the human mind,
	but above all that can be called mind, — another higher and wider essence and energy of consciousness altogether.
	Mind is that which seeks after truth of any kind or of all kinds within its range, labours to know it, attempts to
	direct and utilise it.
	But by supermind I mean a divine awareness which inherently possesses truth, knows it by its own intrinsic identity
	with it and puts it into action or effect spontaneously by its own sovereign power without any need of endeavour or
	labour.
	Mind even though it seeks after knowledge and can sometimes grasp its figure or touch its shadow, is a product of
	the cosmic Inconscient or of a Half-Conscience-Ignorance; supermind is an eternal Truth-consciousness, a divine
	Knowledge self-maintained for ever and luminous in its own right beyond all Ignorance.

	They stumble up against each other, strive and wrestle blindly; for they cannot even [in] the highest man accomplish

<p class="P">
	Earth and conscious life upon earth are not a freak of cosmic Chance, a meaningless accident in the vacant history

	the stake of their wager.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To evolve Godhead out of the mud of matter, some divinest consciousness out of a primal inconscience and a

	the falsehoods and denials of this relative world is their great and daring gamble.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All life upon earth is the evolution of a divine Spirit that is concealed as by a self-formed mask and robe in the
	appearance of Matter.
	Out of that involution it evolves, manifests by a series of ascendent steps its suppressed powers and, once this
	process has begun, will not cease till the Godhead is manifest in Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man is a struggling transitional term, an intermediate being who has gathered up into himself the consciousness of
	the mineral and the vegetable, of the insect and the animal, and is fashioning and refining in the confused twilight
	and chaos of a half knowledge founded on Ignorance the materials of the god that is to be born.

	The instrument of man is mind and thinking and willing mind-force — just as the instrument of the animal is life
	instinct and feeling and remembering life force and the instrument of the plant and tree existence is the vital push
	and the dynamism of material energy turning into force of life.
	As these lower states developed up to a point at which Mind-intelligence could descend into the organised living
	body and take up the earth-past to mentalise and transform it, so Mind in man has to develop up to a point at which
	a consciousness greater than Mind can descend into the mind and living body and take up the human material to
	supramentalise and transform it into godhead.
	This is man's rise to the Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">An air from a consciousness greater than mind has already been felt by many of those who have climbed to
	the human summits and to the glow that has come from above they have given many names, <em>bodhi</em>, intuition,
	gnosis. But these things are only the faint edge of that greater light thrust into the pallid twilight that we call
	mind. Only when the lid between mind and supermind has been utterly rent apart and the full power of the sun of a
	divine Gnosis can pour down—not trickling through mind as in diminished and deflected beams—and transform the whole
	mind and life and body of the human creature, can man's labour finish. Then only shall begin the divine play and the
	free outpouring of the liberated self-creating Spirit.</p>

	All that we see in us and around us in this material world is a mystery-play of the Eternal and Infinite; it is the

	Divinity who has hidden his real from his manifested self in the vast black disguise of the inconscience of Nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This is the constant miracle that is the key to the meaning of existence, — the miracle of the birth and growth of
	life and consciousness in the inanimation and inconscience of the material universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The birth and growth of consciousness is the whole sense of evolution.
	For evolution is not in its inner and essential character a development of more and more organised forms of Matter.
	This development is only an outer instrumentation for the evolution of life and of consciousness in life.
	That again in its deepest inmost sense is a growth embodying the slow self-discovery and self-revelation of a soul
	or spirit in a form of living matter.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 268267</p>
<p class="P">
	The evolution has been an<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="91" href="#">1</a> ascension starting from forms that seem to be
	inanimate and inconscient objects, for in them the spirit in things is asleep, through a leisurely waking in plant
	and animal till it reached with difficulty a beginning of self-awareness in man the mental being, the first and only
	speaking, thinking, reasoning creature.
	But there is no ground for the idea cherished by this imperfect human being that he is the summit and last word of
	the evolution.
	Humanity is one step in the destiny of the evolving spirit, the last before it assumes something of its own divinity
	delivered and apparent; his imperfect life and consciousness must develop itself into the type of the fully
	conscious being, after man or out of him must be born the superman.
	This consummation can only take place by an evolution of the consciousness of the individual and humanity beyond its
	present stage of development; it can take place only if man is ready to take the turn towards which Nature has been
	slowly leading him, to discover himself, to know himself as soul and spirit, to see and lay firm hold on the Reality
	behind world and life and things after which he has been seeking through the ages.
	Nature's first evolution has been an evolution of Matter, of physical objects, of the stage, scenery, external
	conditions and instruments of the drama of an evolving conscious Life in Matter.
	In life itself she has been content at first to organise a physicality, an externality of life; the evolution of the
	body has been the sign, the instrument, the apparent cause of the evolution of consciousness.
	Even when she has arrived at the evolution of Mind, the mind of a humanity which is capable not only of knowing
	outwardly the external world but of going within itself, of knowing itself, of knowing the secret things, powers,
	forces which are behind itself<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="92" href="#">2</a> and behind the works of a surface
	external Nature, still she has been most careful to organise a surface Mind dealing with surface and external things
	and an organisation of personality which is superficial and not the whole of ourselves, a wave only of the ocean of
	our hidden being, our secret reality.
	To build an ego which will deal with material life and nature as its user but also as its subject, a life that is
	bound by matter, a mind that is bound by both matter and life has been her main preoccupation.
	But still the evolution of consciousness is the real and central fact which gives a significance otherwise
	altogether lacking to the mechanical structure of the universe.
	Man is here not merely to utilise his world for the service of his individual and collective ego; he is here as a
	medium in which the Spirit within, the secret growing Consciousness can evolve farther its self-manifestation,
	arrive from a partial to a complete consciousness and, since life itself is there only as a means of this evolution
	and an image of it, at a complete and perfect individual and social life.
	If the psychological truth of our being is the real and central truth, more central and important than the physical,
	this must be its true nature, a conscious being growing towards its own completeness of consciousness and growing
	too towards its expression and formation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="93" href="#">3</a> in a complete individual and

	The Triple Enigma
	</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">83</h4>
<p class="P">
	Existence, consciousness and the significance of our conscious being, — a triple enigma confronts us when we look at
	them to discover their origin, foundations, nature, their innermost secret.
	We begin with a riddle, we end with a mystery.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Existence itself is the first riddle.
	What it is we do not know, we are ignorant how it came to be at all, we cannot say whether it is an eternal fact or
	a temporary phenomenon.
	It may be only an appearance or it may be real, not in itself but as a manifestation of some hidden Reality; but
	then of what is it the manifestation and how came it into being or why had it to be?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness of existence is a second insoluble miracle.
	It seems not to have been and now is and it may be that some day it will not be; yet it is a premier fact and
	without it being would not know of its own existence.
	Things might exist, but only as a useless encumbrance of a meaningless space, — consciousness makes being
	self-aware, gives it a significance.
	But what then is consciousness?
	Is it something in the very grain of being or an unstable result or fortuitous accident?
	To whom does it belong? to the world as a whole? or is it peculiar to individual being?
	Or has it come from elsewhere into this inanimate and inconscient universe?
	To what end this entry?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 272</p>
<p class="P">
	The significance of our conscious being in an inconscient material world is the last and worst enigma.
	What is the sense and justification of the individual, his consciousness, his feeling of self, his personality?
	Is our individuality real or apparent, temporary or permanent, a minor circumstance or a central secret of the
	whole?
	Has it a meaning in the universe or in something beyond the universe? or is it only a chance outburst of Nature with
	no sense in it or any but a mechanical purpose?
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	All these problems arise in our consciousness and in our consciousness alone can be found their solution — or to it
	or through it perhaps from a greater consciousness the solution must come.
	On the nature and validity of our consciousness depends the nature and validity of the discovery we shall make or
	the conclusions to which we can come.
	On the power of our consciousness depends the possibility or impossibility of putting into the terms of life the
	solutions our knowledge discovers.
	But most of all the appearance and development of consciousness in the inconscient world is the decisive factor, the
	one thing that gives its existence a light of meaning, a possibility of purpose, a hope of fulfilment and the soul's
	self-finding.
	To know, then, the nature of consciousness, its process, its birth, growth and destiny is for us a study of supreme
	importance.

<p class="P">
	All the problem of existence turns around three things, the nature of being, the nature of consciousness and the
	secret of the dynamics, the energy of existence by which being and consciousness find each other and manifest what
	is within them.
	If we can discover these three things, all is known which we fundamentally need to know; the rest is application and
	process and consequence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 273</p>
<p class="P">
	The problem of consciousness is the central problem; for it links the other two together and creates their riddle.
	It is consciousness that raises the problem it has to solve; without it there would be no riddle and no solution.
	Being and its energy would then fulfil themselves in form and motion and in cessation of form and motion without any
	self-awareness and without any enjoyment or fruition of their form and motion.
	Existence would be a fact without significance, the universe an inanimate machine turning for ever — or for a time,
	— without any reason or issue in its turning.
	For it to have any significance there must be either a Mind or some other kind of Awareness that observes it,
	originates it perhaps, has joy in its turning, works out something by the turning of the machine for its own
	satisfaction or dissatisfaction; or there must be a consciousness that emerges by the turning and reveals being and
	energy to themselves and leads them to some kind of fulfilment.
	Even if it is only a temporary consciousness that emerges, yet that must be the one significant fact of being, the
	one thing that lights up its movements, makes it aware of itself, raises it to something that is more than a mere
	dead or blank self-existence, a One or a Many that is yet worth no more than a zero.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Even if what fundamentally is in being, is not consciousness but a superconscience, yet that must be one supreme
	kind of self-awareness, if not also all-awareness; for otherwise there would be no difference between
	superconscience and inconscience; the two would be only top-side and bottom-side of the same blank, yet mysteriously
	but vainly fruitful reality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In the ancient tradition eternal and infinite Being and Consciousness carry in them as the result of their oneness
	or coexistence an eternal significance of Bliss, Ananda.
	If we suppose Being-Consciousness to carry in them an eternal and infinite energy that creates, as we say,
	expresses, as the Sanskrit term better puts it, the universe, then the bliss of eternal conscious being would
	contain in itself a bliss of eternal energy of consciousness and being finding itself in the joy of self-expression,
	self-manifestation, self-creation.
	That would be a sufficient explanation of the appearance of a phenomenal universe, there is in fact no other that is
	satisfactory.
	These then are there the three or the four terms underlying all the secret of existence, — Being,
	Consciousness-Energy, Bliss of being, Ananda.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 274</p>
<p class="P">
	It would not materially affect the fundamental satisfactoriness of this explanation that the world we live in is not
	a world of bliss, not a world of consciousness, — though it is in its evident appearance, a world of being and of
	energy of being, that it is in its phenomenal basis inconscient and works itself out through process and labour and,
	when consciousness appears, through joy of being but also through pain of being.
	If the eternal creative Energy takes joy in that, has the Ananda of it (and without consciousness there can be no
	joy or Ananda), as a poet in the creation of his tragedy or comedy, then that would be a sufficient explanation of
	the existence of this universe, though we would still have to seek for its significance, the reason of this choice
	of pain and labour.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness then is the centre of the riddle.
	If we know what is Consciousness, where its action begins and ends — if it has a beginning and an ending, what is
	its process and the significance of its temporal appearance and action, we shall then be able to look deeply into
	being and its energy and understand and solve all their enigma.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	But here in our world of Matter the original and fundamental phenomenon we meet everywhere is a universal
	Inconscience, Consciousness appears to come in as only an incident, a development, a strange consequence of some
	ill-understood operations of Energy in inconscient Matter.
	It arises out of an original Inconscience, it dissolves or sinks back into the Inconscience.
	Once it has appeared it persists indeed but as a general phenomenon precariously manifested in individual living
	beings.
	It has the seeming either of an uncertain freak of inconscient Nature, — a disease some would conjecture, a
	phosphorescence playing upon the stagnant waters of inconscient being, active at certain points of animation, or a
	guest in a world in which it is alien, a foreign resident with difficulty able to maintain itself in a hardly
	amicable environment and atmosphere.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 275</p>
<p class="P">
	According to the materialist hypothesis consciousness must be a result of energy in Matter; it is Matter's<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="94" href="#">1</a> reaction or reflex to itself in itself, a response of organised
	inconscient chemical substance to touches upon it, a record of which that inconscient substance through some
	sensitiveness of cell and nerve becomes inexplicably aware.
	But such an explanation may account, — if we admit this impossible magic of the conscious response of an inconscient
	to the inconscient, — for sense and reflex action [yet] becomes absurd if we try to explain by it thought and will,
	the imagination of the poet, the attention of the scientist, the reasoning of the philosopher.
	Call it mechanical cerebration, if you will, but no mere mechanism of grey stuff of brain can explain these things;
	a gland cannot write Hamlet or pulp of brain work out a system of metaphysics.
	There is no parity, kinship or visible equation between the alleged cause or agent on the one side and on the other
	the effect and its observable process.
	There is a gulf here that cannot be bridged by any stress of forcible affirmation or crossed by any stride of
	inference or violent leap of argumentative reason.
	Consciousness and an inconscient substance may be connected, may interpenetrate, may act on each other, but they are
	and remain things opposite, incommensurate with each other, fundamentally diverse.
	An observing and active consciousness emerging as a character of an eternal Inconscience is a self-contradictory
	affirmation, an unintelligible phenomenon, and the contradiction must be healed or explained before this affirmation
	can be accepted.
	But it cannot be healed unless either the Inconscient has a latent power for consciousness — and then its
	inconscience is phenomenal only, not fundamental, — or else is the veil of a Consciousness which emerges out of a
	state of involution which appears to us as an inconscience.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 276</p>
<p class="P">
	There is no doubt a connection and interdependence between consciousness and the inconscient substance in which it
	resides and through which it seems to operate.
	Consciousness depends upon the body and its functionings, on the brain, nerves, gland-action, right physiological
	working, for its own firm state and action.
	It uses them as its instruments and, if they are injured or unable to act, the action of the consciousness may also
	be in part or whole impaired, impeded or suspended.
	But this does not prove that the action of consciousness is an action of the body and nothing else.
	There is an instrumentation and if the instrument is impaired, the user of the instrument can no longer manifest
	himself rightly through it; if it is destroyed, he cannot operate any longer unless or until he can get another
	instrument.
	This then has to be seen whether the phenomena of consciousness are such that they make it necessary to suppose such
	a use or instrumentation of the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If so then either there must be a conscious being in us that is other than the body or else a conscious Energy that
	thinks, senses, observes, acts intelligently through the physical instrument.
	This is what we actually observe in our experience of ourselves that there is such a being or else such an energy at
	work in us and this self-experience is surely as valid, as binding as the accompanying experience of an inconscient
	substance or building of inconscient Matter which is its field and habitat.
	Both sides of the phenomenon must be given their value; to reject Matter as an illusion of Consciousness or
	Consciousness as a freak or disease of Matter are equally one-eyed views which miss the true problem and are not
	likely to lead to a satisfying solution.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is certainly possible, prima facie, that Consciousness may be a subordinate phenomenon dependent on Matter or,
	more accurately, on the Energy that formulates Matter.
	Our need then is to discover its exact nature, origin, function in a material world and the utmost limit of its
	possibilities for the human being; for to man matter is only a basis of his life, a material of his works, an
	opportunity; what is really important to him is consciousness, for it is his consciousness and use of consciousness
	that gives him his significance and importance to himself and the world; without it he would be nothing and mean
	nothing.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 277</p>
<p class="P">
	At any rate this is the fact that faces us, that there is an apparent Energy that seems to have built up this world
	which first in the animal and then more amply in man has become and works as a conscious Energy and that this
	transformation is the crucial and capital fact of our universe.
	It may well be that in it lies the secret of the significance of that universe.
	It may turn out on deeper enquiry that a Conscious Energy has created as its field an inconscient substance and is
	veiled in its creation and emerges in it, a Power, a Godhead releasing itself slowly and with difficulty out of its
	self-made chrysalis of material Inconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is not sufficient to examine the material, the physiological processes accompanying the functioning of
	consciousness and attempt to explain the functioning by its physical processes.
	This leaves consciousness itself unexplained; if it accounts to some extent, but imperfectly, for sense phenomena or
	mechanical thinking, it does not account in the least for the most important powers of our conscious energy; it does
	not account for reason, understanding, will, creative thought, conscious selection, the conscious intellectual and
	spiritual action and self-development of the human being.
	Yet these are of capital importance, for it is here that consciousness begins to unfold itself out of its chrysalis
	or matrix of inconscience and a half conscious first working and reveal its true nature.
	Here consciousness acts in its own right, in its own field and not as a product of the body.
	To see how the body uses consciousness may be within limits a fruitful science, but it is more important to see how
	consciousness uses the body and still more important to see how it evolves and uses its own powers.
	The physiological study of the phenomenon of consciousness is only a side-issue; the psychological study of it
	independent of all reference to the body except as an instrument is the fruitful line of inquiry.
	A body using consciousness is the first outward physical fact of our existence, the first step of our evolution; a
	consciousness using a body is its inner spiritual reality, it is what we have become by our evolution and more and
	more completely are[.]

	What is Consciousness?
</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">85</h4>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness — but what is consciousness?
	A word only conveniently ticketing a class<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">1</a> of natural phenomena or a
	fundamental reality of existence?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 278</p>
<p class="P">
	Apparently a phenomenon which has only a small range intervening in an immense mass of things inconscient and
	without significance, consciousness alone gives a value to the universe.
	It seems to have taken no part in the creation of the universe; it was not there in the beginning or even during the
	greater part of the history of the earth; it may not be there at its end.
	In the middle it plays a great role in the life of animal and man, but its action is crude and ill-developed in the
	animal, imperfect in the human creature.
	Its evolution wears the character of an episode in the long history of an inconscient world, a chapter that began
	some time ago, but one knows not why it intervened at all or how it will end<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="96" href="#">2</a> or whether its appearance has any meaning, whether its developing importance has an accidental
	and meaningless or a purposeful and revelatory character.
	It may be a freak of creative Chance or it may be or may carry in itself the whole meaning of the world-drama.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In an inconscient universe, in a Nature or the working of an Energy which is fundamentally material, the emergence
	[of] Consciousness has at first the air of a surprising, a contradictory, an impossible event.
	For in such a world, in the working of such a Nature or Energy, how could it ever come into existence?
	Either there is no real consciousness, only an action of Matter or unconscious Energy which takes this inexplicable
	and deceptive form, or Nature or Energy is not fundamentally inconscient.
	Consciousness was always a possibility which at a certain stage chanced or was bound to take place, or it was a
	latent power that has become manifest.
	Or even it may be all Nature is really conscious and it is we who foist inconscience upon her because we are limited
	to a certain range and character of consciousness and cannot communicate with her other ranges or even detect their
	existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 279</p>
<p class="P">
	It has been held by a certain opinion that consciousness in itself does not exist, there are only phenomena of
	reactions of Matter to Matter or of Energy in Matter to Energy in Matter to which by generalisation we give the
	name.
	There is no person who is conscious, thinks, speaks, perceives, wills, acts; it is an organised body in which
	certain chemical, molecular, cellular, glandular and nerve activities take place and certain material results and
	reactions of these activities take place in the brain which take the form of these phenomena.
	It is the body that thinks, perceives, wills, speaks, acts; it is Matter that goes through these operations and
	becomes aware of them; it may be said that brain-matter makes a record or notation of these actions and this
	notation is consciousness and this record is memory.
	There is nothing in the world except Matter and the operations of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This theory arose when physical Science concentrated on the operations of Matter, saw only Matter and energy of
	Matter everywhere; it persists even after that seeing of things has been severely shaken.
	For now we are driven to see and say that there is no such thing as Matter in itself; what we call Matter is only a
	mass of phenomena of Energy, events of energy, which our senses regard as objects and our minds classify under the
	general name of Matter.
	But we can still hold that all phenomena are phenomena of Energy acting in the forms or sensible events which we
	call Matter and the phenomena of consciousness are of that character.
	There is nothing else to it, nothing but the mobile and executive Energy, Nature, Prakriti; there is no soul, no
	Purusha.
	Consciousness would still be a general name for a brain-record and notation of these events of material Energy and
	this will still be the true character of thought, perception, will, speech, act.
	All these events are separate phenomena which may act and react on each other or group themselves together, but they
	are not the result or manifestations of any one general force or power of being that we can call Consciousness.

	Consciousness, — but what is consciousness?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 280</p>
<p class="P">
	And first of all we have to face the possibility that there is no such thing.
	For many hold that the word is an unreal generalisation invented to cover a class of material phenomena having their
	origin in Matter and material in their nature and essence, an operation of Matter on Matter and in Matter.
	Thoughts are only vibrations of the grey matter of the brain; they are not something other [than] that or capable of
	existing beyond the material plane; they cannot exist independently of the brain; brain is not their instrument of
	expression or manifestation; they are [its] instrument made of its substance, dependent on [its] substance,
	inexistent without it.
	Mind is an action of Matter, not a separate power or force; there is nothing in it superior to the physicality of
	the body; it exists by the body and as a part of its activity, lasts along with it, dies with it.
	Mind is a product of gases, some operation of Nature's chemistry, glandular influences, nervous stimuluses; it is
	matter and records the operations of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But why then this appearance of mentality, of consciousness, of a conscious being?
	That too is only a trick of Matter.
	They are reflexes and reactions to the contacts of things outside, to other material objects, bodies, movements,
	forces.
	Sense and sensation are the reply of the nerves to stimulus of external and material things or to internal stimuli
	that are still material.
	To the experience of the body the result of these, recoils, reflexes, reactions, may seem mental, but that cannot
	alter the fact that they are material products of the workings of Matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Well, be it so; but still this mentality creates an awareness of self and things and the movements of self and
	things, even if both be only a body and so many other bodies, and it is difficult to describe awareness as an
	inconscient movement or condition or as the inconscient seeming to be conscious.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">1</a>
	Evidently we are in face of a general sophism invented by specialists of a limited field of data, the data of
	inconscient Matter, who are determined to force everything into its characteristic formulas and refuse to admit
	everything else.
	We must at least recover the right to see this awareness and its movements as they are or as they present themselves
	to us and see how far it leads us and whether indeed, even if it occurs in matter and the body, it does not lead us
	to something other than the body and other than Matter.
	The materialist contention that consciousness is not a separate power or force or manifestation of energy like
	electricity or magnetism or steam, but only a name for a particular bundle of brain phenomena, cannot hide the
	startling fact that inconscient and insentient Matter has become sentient and conscient even if it be only at
	points, in jets, in small masses.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 281</p>
<p class="P">
	This awareness has created at least the appearance of a sentient and conscient being who not only becomes relatively
	aware of self and things, but can study them, discover their nature and process, determine and develop the
	possibilities of his own consciousness and the possibilities of the world's forces and processes, can will and can
	create, can ponder and philosophise, can write poetry and create works of art, can use [? ] to modify and alter the
	world around him and make for himself a different life-environment, can look beyond Matter, can tend towards the
	heights of consciousness not yet developed, can envisage the Superconscient.
	If the consciousness that can do all this is not a force, a power in itself, it at least looks strangely like it.
	And we have the right, at least hypothetically, to study it as such a power or force and find out how far that leads
	us.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It may even lead us to the discovery of a Reality greater than the world of Matter or of Energy building up shapes
	of Matter and movements in Matter.
	It may take us beyond phenomena and appearances to the truth of things and to something that is the origin of all
	that seems to be[.]

<p class="P">At the other extreme of human mentality we meet a similar and more devastating denial. Consciousness has no
	real existence; or, so far as it exists at all, it is as a dynamic Power, a creator of illusions. There is nothing
	sound or real in what it builds; there is nothing true in what it sees; the world it shows us is [an] impossible
	chimera, a mass of figments and falsehoods. The sole consciousness that is true is the self-awareness of some
	absolute Silence, a spaceless immobile Infinite, a timeless featureless Eternity. Or, as the materialist sees only a
	bundle of phenomena material and dependent on Matter or a fortuitous result of material operations, so the
	Nihilistic Buddhist sees only a bundle of associations, <em>sanskaras</em>, which stuck together produce the false
	appearance of a continuity of concrete phenomena or a stream of momentary perceptions giving the impression of a
	false self and coherent world, a coherent personality, but if the bundle is dissolved, if the stream ceases to flow,
	all dissolves and</p>
<p class="P">
	Here too we seem to be in front of [the] sophism of a specialist seizing the sole salient and striking side, the one
	prominent aspect of Truth in which he is versed putting aside all the rest as inconsistent or invalid.
	After all the world exists and is too persistent and effective and solid a phenomenon to be put aside or merely
	whistled off the field with an airy “It is not”; — a mirage is ineffectual and recedes or fades if it is touched, an
	illusion dissolves if revealed but this is stupendously effective, overwhelmingly persistent and we have to sound
	all its possibilities before dismissing it as something vain and trifling.
	World-consciousness may be only one aspect of our being, but it is a big and momentous aspect and it too should be
	given its full chance of justifying itself before it is ruled out of court.
	The eternal reality of a pure immobile existence and its self-awareness is also a truth of our being.
	But it is not impossible that these are two aspects of one Reality and not so incompatible as the metaphysical
	logician imagines.
	This is what we propose to do integrally and with a full and exhaustive<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="98" href="#">2</a>
	inquiry before we decide either way.
	The chances are that so enormous a thing as this world is something more than an astonishing chimera.
	The chances are that when two such great aspects of existence confront each other, there is a connection somewhere,
	a reconciliation of their contraries.
	It is possible that both are aspects, static and dynamic, of some absolute Reality from which both have drawn their
	own reality and in which they have their true and inevitable place.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 283</p>
<p class="P">
	In any case consciousness is the one thing by which we can consider or decide the question at all.
	It is the one thing by which we know at all that world exists or can inquire into its truth and its meaning.
	If consciousness has no reality and no value, then there is nothing by which we can know the truth, — one
	explanation of things has then as little value as the other, neither can be claimed as the truth.
	The consciousness by which we affirm the featureless sole Reality can be as fallacious as that by which we affirm
	our individual self and the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If consciousness is the self-awareness of the eternal Existence, it can only be this self-awareness seeing its own
	power and the works of its power as a real world.
	If consciousness is a creation of the evolution, it is also the one thing by which it receives some value, the one
	thing by which its values can be reckoned, its [...], its one central and essential value.
	It is not by the development of forms that evolution reaches its height, but by the evolution of consciousness.
	The degree of consciousness is the degree of evolution; the extent to which consciousness has developed its powers,
	range, height, its fulness of vision and self-vision, is the measure of the evolution's development of its work and
	aim, its progress towards its goal, if goal indeed it has and is not the incoherent working out of an accidental
	Chance.
	Indeed, if we look at the way in which the Inconscient has devised the world and the sequences by which it has
	arrived at intelligence, we have some reason [to think] that it is a secret Consciousness which has made this world
	and under the mask of inconscience has emerged as a slow process of an Ignorance developing Knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If so, it may well be that it is the self-awareness of the [eternal Existence] that is working out in the formula of
	inconscient Matter and ignorant Life and half-awakened Mind its own self-manifestation in the material universe.

	But what is consciousness and what its relation to existence?
	How and why did it come into being in an inconscient universe, a universe which even if it originated by an
	inexplicable chance, has assumed the proportions of a huge and complex inexorable mechanism repeating the same
	processes through the aeons without respite or cessation?
	By what spiritual or mechanical necessity? by what mechanical chance or accidental process of Energy?
	To what end or purpose, if any purpose there can be in an inconscient mechanism of brute Necessity or inexplicably
	organised Chance or any end in a movement which never had any reason for beginning?
	Does consciousness exist or is it a fortuitous illusion?
	Who or what is it that becomes conscious in the animal and in the body of the human being?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Three possible solutions.
	Consciousness has not come into being but was and is always there, a fundamental power of existence, latent or
	involved or concealed from our mind and sense even in what we call inanimate and unconscious things.
	It has not come into existence but has emerged from existence; involved it has evolved in the general evolutionary
	process.
	Or consciousness is only a phenomenon, a surprising result of certain inconscient processes of Nature, unintentional
	but actual, unnecessary and accidental or else somehow inevitable as an output of chemical and other physical
	energies which could not help imposing itself at a certain point of their activity in the natural course of things.
	It did not exist before that point was reached; when another point has been reached it may go out of existence.
	Or again the world is a creation of an extra-cosmic or immanent conscious Being personal or impersonal who has
	either put his consciousness or a consciousness resembling his into his mechanical creation to be an element there
	or else has infused it from within into the mechanical self-expression in which he has chosen to dwell as its
	upholder, inspirer, inhabitant.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What is meant by consciousness? what is this phenomenon which seems to have so small a part in the vast inconscient
	mass of things and is yet the sole element here that can give any value to the universe?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 285</p>
<p class="P">
	And to come to the heart of the difficulty — is it indeed only a phenomenon, an appearance that has emerged in the
	course of the workings of an Energy which was, is and will always remain inconscient?
	Or is it something fundamental, an inherent reality or a latent character or power of that Energy and bound to
	emerge at some time once it had begun its workings?

	where they are absent, as in a tree, we suppose the object, even if it has life, to be inconscient by its very
	nature, incapable of sensation no less than empty of thought and will.
	Where life is not, inconscience seems to us a still more self-evident character of the thing or being.
	Man alone is fully conscious, for he alone is aware of himself, reflective on things, in full possession of mental
	capacities and their aware and observant use.
	Mind and consciousness are almost synonymous to our ordinary notions; where consciousness is not mentalised, we find

</p>
<p class="P">
	Our life is not an illusion nor a delirium nor is Nature a Maya, a fabricator of dreams or a dealer in vanities as
	certain religions would have it nor is one the outcome of a blind Force or the trick [of] a blind self-regulating
	Chance, the other an unconscious Power as it must be if the materialists' dogma were true.
	Our life is neither a freak of God nor a freak of Nature; it has a conscious plan although a secret plan, a
	significance although an occult and mystic significance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The plan, the significance are secret and mysterious to us because we live on the surface of ourselves and things
	and are not in touch with either their core or their height or depths.
	Science on one side, Religion and Philosophy on the other try to arrive at the hidden Truth, but each touches and
	only just touches one end of it and refuses to go farther and discover the other end or the link and reconciling
	relation between these two poles of existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 288</p>
<p class="P">
	It is said in the Veda of Agni, the flame of the creative Will and Force, that he hides his two extremities; only
	his middle is patent and visible.
	The head of Agni is occult in some superconscient height, his feet are plunged in the abyss of the material
	Inconscience.
	Consciousness emerging in the universe of life and mind is the bridge and link between the two poles.
	But our human consciousness is a term in the chain which is aware only of itself and sees all the rest in its own
	terms; it cannot identify itself with the other links and misses their significance and their purpose.
	It stands on the middle of the bridge looking all around it, but the bridgeheads are to its sight invisible.
	It cannot see what is there, but only speculate, infer or conjecture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Science questing with its measuring rod of empirical experiment begins to have a dark glimpse of the Inconscient; it
	knows the universe as an organised freak that has emerged from the material Inconscience and will go back to its
	source.
	Religion and Philosophy rise<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">1</a> on the wings of spiritual experience or in
	a balloon of metaphysical logic into some stratosphere of superconscient Reality, they seem to discover a God or
	Self or Spirit or Absolute and try to map it with the intellect or to turn it into a dynamic spiritual formula.
	But they are unable to reconcile these three terms of being; their physical experiments or their spiritual
	experiences are valid, but each has hold of only one end of the enigma.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 289</p>
<p class="P">
	Science has discovered Evolution; Religion and Philosophy have discovered something of that which is involved and
	evolves in this cosmic Existence.
	But the two discoveries have refused to shed light upon each<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">2</a> other;
	each has shut itself up in its own formulas.
	This is because each is a creation and activity of Mind, Science of the concretising experimental mind, Philosophy
	of the abstracting intellectual mind, Religion of the dynamic spiritual mind.
	But Mind is bound always by its partial formulations of the Truth; Mind grasps formulas or images but is itself
	grasped by its own creations, it cannot get free from them or go beyond them.
	But the mind's concepts and formulas are only fragmentary representations of Truth or pointers or abstract schemas
	and images, not her very self and reality.
	Either a deeper inner soul-vision or a higher overmental or supramental consciousness is needed to discover Truth in
	her very face and body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Then only can both ends of the riddle be firmly seized and connected together, the whole of existence seen in one
	gaze and life compelled to unmask its fathomless significance[.]
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	A mysterious something involved in Matter, concealed by it, evolving from it but in a material house or figure,
	striving to reveal itself in life and mind, but concealed by its forms of life, concealed by its forms of mind,
	shooting out from them glimpses of itself, glimpses that hint but do not elucidate, — this is what we can see, and
	we see no more; the rest is speculation and conjecture.
	Is this something native to Matter, born in it and destined to die in it?
	Or is it an alien, a temporary visitor?
	Is Matter itself only a mask of it, a phenomenon of Energy, as it now more and more seems to be?
	Energy itself is a movement, a force of concealed Consciousness, Consciousness the sign of a hidden spiritual Being.
	But if so, what possible significance or purpose can there be in this involution, this material self-concealment and
	self-imprisonment, this slow tormented emergence of the Spirit?
</p>
<p class="P">
	Two lines of enquiry seem to give, though imperfectly and in opposition, a positive base for a reply to the question
	and the riddle, — the experiments of the scientist and the experience of the mystic.

	Consciousness and the Inconscient</h1></h2>
<h2 class="Cp-Nm" id="">
	Inconscience</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">93</h4>
<p class="P">
	World and life can be looked at from one of two opposite vision-bases — observed in the light of the knowledge that
	looks below and sees as the foundation of things the Inconscient from which our physical birth took its rise or
	experienced in the light of the knowledge that looks above and draws the radiations it throws upon all around it
	from the Superconscient which is our soul's source.
	These two conflicting light-streams — which yet at their extreme points seem almost to meet or at least touch the
	same mystery — yet shed at first opposite values on the phenomenon of conscious life in matter and illumine in
	contrary senses the destiny of man and his place in world-existence; for in the light from above it assumes a
	supreme significance, in the light from below a supreme insignificance.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 291</p>
<p class="P">
	For if we look from one side, consciousness appears as a circumstance, a thing secondary or even accidental, a
	little flickering temporary uncertain light in a vast darkness of inconscient world-systems; if we look from the
	other it is the slowly delivered but not yet perfectly released blaze of that which supported all along this
	seemingly inconscient creation, subtly concealed in its very cells, molecules, atoms, electrons or whatever still
	more infinitesimal whorls of motional force-substance have been made its base.
	Either then consciousness is a perishable jet of flame shooting up out of the slime of this obscure teeming morass
	we call Matter, a strange inexplicable temporary freak sprung from gas and plasm, chromosome and gene, gland and
	hormone — we know not well how even when we have found the process, and know not at all why and can never know and
	hardly need to know, since the whole thing is a meaningless and eventually purposeless miracle of incalculable
	Chance or blind Necessity, — or if it is not this, then it is the very Flame which, dynamic and hidden, has shaped
	all these things and now, overt and revealed, can work openly on them and on itself to use, to uplift, to subtilise,
	to refine, to liberate, to transfigure.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 292</p>
<p class="P">
	If the first view is right, the view so long pressed on us by physical Science, then this very universe itself is
	but a queer paradoxical movement of mindless eyeless Force or of a brute substance emanating purposeless energy,
	which yet works as if it had a purpose; for it produces by some inconscient compulsion on itself a steady succession
	of evolutionary forms that carry themselves as if they had an aim and a meaning, although in the nature of things
	they can really have none.
	The whole is a mechanism which automatically turns out what it must with a certain inevitability but has no
	comprehending Intelligence, no intuitive Power behind it to determine its use.
	Universal Nature is a Chance that works as if it were a Necessity or else perhaps a Necessity that works like a
	self-regulating Chance.
	What seems to be consciousness has come out of this machine just like everything else in this singular
	freak-universe, constituted somehow, miraculously, impossibly, as the plant and the flower came out of the seed,
	somehow constituted, or as different chemical atoms are mysteriously constituted out of variant numbers of identical
	electrons, or as water leaps inexplicably into birth by a combination in exact measure of two gases.
	We have discovered that by just this process it came, — consciousness, the flower, the atom, water, — but how it
	could come into being by such a process is an unsolved riddle and how it took this form out of such a mother or
	could be the result of such ingredients and what each of these things in itself is remains unknowable.
	It is or has so become (or perhaps is not, but only so seems to our senses) — but that is all, for more than this
	science limited by its methods cannot tell and speculative philosophy itself with all its range and licence can
	hardly conjecture.
	And it does not much matter; for after all this consciousness which emerged obscurely in Time will in a later Time
	disappear with its living vessels and be as if it had never been leaving behind the Inconscient still busy with its
	perpetual and empty labour.
	And perhaps indeed this consciousness is not really consciousness at all but only a sort of strange vibrant
	typewriting of conventional signs by which the Inconscient records to itself its own mechanical values; for things
	are not what they seem, colour is not colour but only a fictitious sign, all things perhaps are mere signs of
	bundled vibrations and consciousness itself nothing else.
	However we look at it, it would seem very much as if this universal Energy which creates these strange,
	inexplicable, impossible things or semblances that yet in a way are, were only a sort of Maya, like that of the
	Illusionists, <em>aghatana-ghatana-patiyasi</em>, very skilful to make happen things that cannot
	happen, a huge senseless well organised paradox, a sequently arranged mass of inevitable inconsequences, a defiance
	to reason of which reason is the last brilliant but bewildered outcome.
	And of all these phenomenal appearances, the uprising of consciousness is perhaps the most paradoxical, the least
	inevitable, — Nature's most accidental, most startling inconsequence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 293</p>
<p class="P">
	And again in this reading of the universe, more baffling than any unbelievable belief — <em>credo quia
		incredibile</em>, — with which ever dogmatic theology or mystic philosophy has challenged us, man loses all his
	cosmic value.
	An infinitesimal little creature on a tiny speck of matter lost amidst a whirling multitude of stupendous universes
	most or all of them perhaps vacant of life and thought and made for no other end but simply to whirl, he is
	(justifying Scripture) even as the worm is — only an edition de luxe, with copious developments and commentaries, of
	the same laborious but useless text, the same minute, careful, well-arranged, painstaking but insignificant script
	that we see already in the ant and the termite.
	Individual man lasts for a few years which are in the aimless vastness of the universe of no more matter than the
	few days or weeks or months of the insect.
	The race indeed has endured for millions of years and may endure for some centuries, some thousands, myriads or
	millions of years longer; but what are these millions in the incalculable aeons of the cosmos?
	The termite perhaps was before man and may be there when he has disappeared, perhaps massacring his kind out of
	existence or destroyed by his own science; it has like man done against adverse conditions extraordinary miracles of
	intelligence (having yet, it seems, no intelligence with which to do them), built immense fortified cities,
	cultivated earth, organised remarkable societies, adapted means to end and overcome a stepmotherly Nature.
	Each has an equal value for itself which arrives after all only to the passion Nature has put in each species for
	survival, for exploitation of its life; for each other their only significance is to come annoyingly and
	destructively in each other's way; for the universe — at least the universe as Science has described it — both have
	an equal non-value, for to it neither can matter, since they will disappear and the world go on interminably as it
	did without them.
	Vanity of vanities, Science teaches us even as did the world's Scriptures; out of nothingness we came and into
	nothingness we shall sink hereafter.
	All that we are and think and create [and] do, however wonderful to our own eyes, or even if really wonderful in the
	mind's values, is but a bubble, a vibration, a plasmic pullulation on the surface of Matter.
</p>

<p class="P">
	If there is a consciousness in Matter, however secret and involved, there must be a consciousness secret and
	involved in the Inconscient.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the question then arises whether such a thing can be any more than there can be a square circle [or] cold fire.
	“Not even a hundred declarations of the Veda,” says Shankara, “could prove the coldness of fire.”
	There are psychologists who deny that there is or can be any such thing as the subconscious, for it is a flat
	self-contradiction to speak of a consciousness which is below the level of consciousness.
	To be conscious is to be aware of self and things or at least of things, with whatever limitation, as a man's or an
	animal's waking mind is aware.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 294</p>
<p class="P">
	To a certain thought it might seem that only the surface of things is knowable, the rest either does not or cannot
	exist or must be left in the shadow of an inevitable agnosticism.
	There are no depths [or they] are, as Bertrand Russell would have us believe, an uninhabited emptiness; there is no
	inner sky except the sky of thought or an abstract void crossed by the wandering wings of the Idea; if there is a
	sky behind the sky, it is such a Void, a void of unattainable superconscience.
	But this too is an imagination, a nonexistence.
	There can be no consciousness in the Inconscient, no Conscious in unconscious things, no superconscience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If that were so, it would be impossible to have any true or whole knowledge.
	For our mind is an Ignorance searching for knowledge and arriving at representations or figures of it, it can never
	be except by a miraculous transformation something that knows, still less knows truly and knows all.
	But knowledge exists somewhere, knowledge is possible and a seeking ignorance is not our first and last fate.
	Our boundaries are lost [...], the depths teem [or] are no longer vacant, the sky above mind is peopled with winged
	realities.
	The subconscient is disburdened of its strange contents, the superconscient becomes the top [of] consciousness, the
	peak of knowledge, there is a Conscient in unconscious things.
	Let us look then with the eye of the Ignorance first but also with the eye of this greater knowledge at the
	subconscient, at Inconscience, at the superconscient top of things.
	An immediate change will take place in our conception of self and our outlook on the universe.

<p class="P">
	The subconscious is a fact of our mentality.
	It is not the fact that our whole being, even our whole mentality, is on the surface.
	There are concealed heights, there are hidden gulfs, there are crowded spaces behind the front wall, below the
	threshold, in the unseen mental environment.
	There is a vast inconscient below us, an infinite superconscience above us.
	All these are part of a secret consciousness in the world, but also part of our own hidden being of which we are not
	aware or only intermittently and ignorantly or only, in our ultimate evolution, eventually aware.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Even in our ordinary experience there are moments in which one or other of these things becomes apparent, acts in
	our daily actions or peers out above the surface and replaces our absent and inattentive mind.
	We start writing and finish the writing without knowing what we have written.
	We are walking with our mind aware and guiding our course, — the [?outer] mind, — but we continue to walk and find
	ourselves after a time farther on the intended way or beyond the intended goal or turn and have to retrace our
	steps.
	In an unconscious or half conscious moment words pour from our lips which we would never have spoken if we had used
	our fully awake mind and will.
	What is it that thus takes up the writing, the walk, the speech and completes our intention or betrays us?
	It must be either something of the mind behind or below its active surface movement or something of a driving
	life-force or action of the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But in the first explanation there must be a part of the mind, not our conscious thought and will that is capable of
	continuing automatically a course once habitual or previously fixed or pursuing of itself the direction accustomed
	or repetitive.
	It is capable not only of execution but of a radical direction, even a misdirection.
	This means a consciousness at conscious work, however vague or latently automatic, and can only be described as a
	subconscient or at least partly subconscious or subjacent, an underlying something else akin to consciousness.
	This is the first sign of a subconscient mind or of a secret consciousness which may even underlie not only our own
	surface being, but the whole cosmic operation and its apparently inconscient functioning and driven interactions,
	its purposeless purpose.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If it is a life-force that goes on with the works of the life when the mind is not attending to them, then only this
	must be a subconscious action and where it continues an action initiated by the conscious mind, then some sort of
	mechanical consciousness must be attributed to it.
	If it is the body that takes up the action, it must equally be credited with a subconscience that can do under
	certain circumstances the work of consciousness.
</p>

<p class="P">
	I have written a letter and proceed to put the name and address on the envelope, but my mind gets absorbed in
	something else and I find that I have written another habitual name and address, not the one I intended.
	Memory evidently has done this uncalled for work, but not a conscious memory with the mind aware of what it was
	doing.
	A subconscious layer of memory must have come to the surface mistaking the call, or there must have been a double
	action of memory one deliberate, the other automatic, the temporary suspension of the first giving room to an
	inadvertent action of the subliminal working.
</p>
<p class="P">
	On the other hand I may complete a sentence with a phrase I had not intended or thought of; where did it come from

	The Inconscient Energy</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">98</h4>
<p class="pg-num">Page 297</p>
<p class="P">
	At one end of existence, the nether material end, we observe the reign of a complete phenomenal Inconscience.
	No creative consciousness or will can be detected there; we start from something that is but is not aware that it
	is, things that are but are unconscious that they are or that anything is.
	Yet it is this vast impalpable Inconscient that seems to have created Matter and the whole material universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There is, obvious and undeniable, an Energy that creates and there is a creation; these are the only two
	affirmations we can make which are beyond doubt.
	Even if we take the creation to be illusory, still the illusory creation is there and there is a Force or Energy or
	Power that has created it, whether it be mere unconscious Energy, Prakriti, or an energy of deceptive consciousness,
	Maya.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What we actually experience here is an energy inconscient or seemingly inconscient which is in constant motion and
	in that motion takes on forms or produces forms and in these forms it enters into many kinds of activity and
	engenders a multitude of active relations.
	Energy and action and the results of action, Prakriti and Karma, this is the whole formula of the material universe.
	Objects innumerable there are, lives too and things living, a Mind or minds, a Consciousness or consciousnesses or
	else perhaps mere phenomena in the Inconscient to which we give these names; but all these appear to us as if they
	were temporary results, events ephemeral or long persistent of the movement of Energy and action, its Karma.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What is this Energy? is it something uncreated and unborn, eternal, absolute though all it produces is created,
	temporal, relative?
	If it is born, then whence came it? in or on what does it work? what set it going and towards what?
	We do not know and seem to have no means of knowing; at least our intellect does not know and has not yet found out
	any sure way to know; it can only speculate, speculate endlessly in an inconclusive circle.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 298</p>
<p class="P">
	It is not an unborn eternal Matter from which it is born or of which it is the eternal force or in and on which it
	works, as was once supposed and as some still suppose.
	For that is now only a construction of the speculative mind, an idea, a hypothesis, an arbitrary postulate for which
	there is no discoverable correspondent reality.
	Matter, as we now know it, is something that we can almost see coming into existence or at least can determine its
	process of creation; waves of energy materialising into particles and again becoming waves, but finally the waves
	coalesce and become atoms of what we must needs call Matter.
	This cannot be the inert inconscient Godhead, original and eternal, out of which all came, in and on which Energy
	works and produces by automatic necessity or a fortunately self-organising Chance the material world and all the
	lives, minds, souls — if souls there are — which in it live and move.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It can be said that this is only a conclusion of Science and Science is unfinished and everchanging; it may refute
	tomorrow what it affirms today; it may discover that electricity and light, the electron and proton and the photon
	are not the last word or the first fact; there may be a subtler Matter which is not that but something else — a
	Matter not formed but motional, vibratory, aetheric.
	But, still, what can that be but a subtler motion of Energy, a vibration of Energy in Space?
	And of Space too we do not know what it is, — whether<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">1</a> a mere
	conception of our mind and its sense or an extension of something that exceeds the grasp of our mind and sense, —
	perhaps an unseizable Infinite.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The Sankhya philosopher affirmed an original indiscriminate Matter which evolves from Prakriti, from the eternal
	Energy, — is, we might say, its first state of manifestation.
	But as it is indiscriminate, it is not likely to be in any way determinable by our senses.
	And, after all, this too is only a creation of Energy, an evolution out of itself or a state which it assumes; we do
	not get away from the original formula, Energy and its actions and results, Prakriti and Karma.

	An energy of some Inconscient Existence has created Matter and the material universe.
	All this material universe is indeed nothing but an inconscient Energy taking form or producing form and in and
	through its forms entering into all kinds of activity.
	Energy (Prakriti) and motion and action of Energy, Karma, and results of its action — this is the formula of our
	universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But whence then comes consciousness?
	How can things in their very nature inconscient and unaware become conscious or develop some kind of awareness?
	There is here a contradiction which is inexplicable and the more we look at it, becomes more and more inexplicable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This is possible because inconscience is a phenomenon not a fundamental reality.
	A phenomenon is something that appears to us, but does not show to us the whole reality of existence or of its own
	existence; it is a front, a face, a circumstance of something more than itself that does not appear but is — the
	Reality.
	Inconscience is a phenomenal state; it is consciousness that is the Reality; consciousness is an inherent and
	eternal state of being, inconscience is its temporal, temporary and apparent condition when it forms itself by its
	own energy into Matter and material objects.
	Its consciousness involves itself in inanimate Matter and seems there an inconscience; its energy too acts as if it
	were an inconscient energy, doing things without knowing what it is doing, creating a universe but unaware of the
	universe it creates, contriving millions of devices, but without any intelligence.
	So it seems, but so it cannot be; there is something hidden from us which we have to discover.
	It is the consciousness behind the Energy, the conscious Being behind the action that we have to discover.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness, being, force, energy (shakti), these are the three first terms of the fundamental truth of existence.
	What we have to know is how they work out together in ourselves and the universe.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Chance, some say, does all; the phenomena of consciousness — for there is no such thing as consciousness in itself,
	only reactive phenomena of sense and mind provoked by outward impacts — are, like everything else, the products of
	Chance.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 300</p>
<p class="P">
	But what is Chance, after all?
	It is only a word, a notion formed by our consciousness to account for things of which we have no true knowledge —
	and it does not account for them.
	When we do not know how or why a thing came to pass, we escape by saying, it was chance.
	We do not truly know how or why the universe happened or things in the universe, so we say “Chance made it; Chance
	did it.”
	An intellectual escape, nothing more.
	If we said “A selection, mysterious to us, out of infinite possibility,” then there would be some truth and some
	profundity in our thinking.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the emergence of consciousness out of the Inconscient was more probably a necessity in the very being of being,
	in the innate movement of being, than merely a possibility.
	Necessity, then? an inevitable determination in Nature? or a self-determination in the conscious Spirit?

<p class="P">
	Our existence is not a freak of some inconscient mechanical Force stumbling into consciousness nor an inexplicable
	activity on the surface of a blank Nothingness or an impassive inactive Infinite.
	There is a significance in our life, it moves towards a spiritual end, it fulfils the drive of an eternal reality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Immortality is the nature of our being, birth and death are a movement and incident of our immortality.
	Birth is an assumption of a body by the spirit, death is the casting off [of] the body; there is nothing original in
	this birth, nothing final in this death.
	Before birth we were; after death we shall be.
	Nor are our birth and death a single episode without continuous meaning or sequel; it is one episode out of many,
	scenes of our drama of existence with its denouement far away in time.

	All depends upon consciousness.
	For all world-existence is a form created by consciousness, upheld by consciousness, determined by consciousness.
	All that is is a consciousness veiled or unveiled, manifesting or concealing its own substance.
	All is energy of consciousness masked by movement of mind and life and matter and taking forms which are merely
	motions of the energy stabilised to appearance, yet always in movement; for the consciousness that constitutes these
	forms is always in dynamic movement; the visible rhythm and self-result of this self-repeating or self-continuing
	vibration and never resting motion and dynamis is what we call form.
	Disperse the energy that constitutes it and the form dissolves.
	Withdraw the consciousness that expresses itself in the energy and the energy can keep up no longer its sustaining
	rhythm; therefore it disperses, therefore the form dissolves.
	If we could so intensify the power of the consciousness put out in us that we could keep the energy always
	repeating, continuing, enlarging, progressing in its rhythm, then, the form might change but need not dissolve and
	even physically we should be immortal[.]

<p class="P">
	Body, brain, nervous system are instruments of consciousness, they are not its causes.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness is its own cause, a producer of objects and images and not their product.
	We are blinded to this truth because when we think of consciousness, it is of the individual we think.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We look at the world in the way and speak of it in the terms of individual consciousness; but it is of the universal
	consciousness that the world is a creation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The individual participates subconsciently and superconsciently in the universal consciousness.
	But the embodied individual in his physical or waking mind does not so much participate as arrive at participation.
	He is not directly part of it, but reproduces it by a partial indirect action, and in reproducing selects and
	varies, combines, discombines, new combines and develops his selections.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In the body his waking mind receives its impressions from the outside world and reacts upon them.
	Body and nerves are his instrument for the impressions and the reaction; therefore all their apparent
	instrumentation is nervous, physical, atomically combined, a physiological apparatus for a battery of nervous
	energy.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Physical, nervous and sensory impressions are the means by which this individual is induced to put himself into
	waking relations with the physical universe.
	Physical, nervous and sensory reactions are his means for entering into that relation.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	He, — but who is he?
	The mental being in his mentality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Who is it that feels himself to be separate from the world or things in the universe to be outside his being?
	Not the Spirit, for the Spirit contains the universe, creates and combines all relations.
	All personalities act in the one spirit, as our own multiple personalities act in one being.
	Spiritual being is their continent, they are not its constituents, but its outer results and the diverse
	representative selves of its consciousness and action.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Not, either, the supramental being.
	For the supramental being is one with the spirit in its original or basic consciousness, in its idea-consciousness
	it is ideally comprehensive of cosmic things or, if we must speak in terms of space, commensurate with the universe.
	The supramental being with one action of his Idea-self can regard universal being as his object of will and
	knowledge.
	That attitude is the seed of mind.
	It can regard it as contained in itself and itself contained in it, and in that way know and govern it.
	But it can too, like Spirit in its real action know all things by identity and govern all things by identity.
	Externality of being does not enter into supramental experience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Supermind can see mind externalising objects; it can itself take a particular viewpoint fronting objects but it is
	in itself that it fronts them, as we front our subjective operations in mind.
	It does not regard them as something outside its own being, as we regard physically objects.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind is a delegation from supermind, which primarily regards existence as an object fronting its vision.
	Mental being also need not regard the universe as quite separate from or outside its own being.
	Subliminal mentality is capable by extension of a comprehensive relation with cosmic things and of entering into
	unity with the universe.
	Mind's starting-point is not a containing universal vision or a knowledge by identity, but an individualised
	viewpoint from which it sees the universe.
	Still mind can arrive at a sort of containing vision, a mentalised cosmic consciousness.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 304</p>
<p class="P">
	What then compels embodied mind to see objects externally and by separation?
	It is compelled by the fact of physical embodiment.
	Body is a self-limitation of conscious being by which mind is rigidly bound down to its own tendency of separative
	individuation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Body, including all physical formations from the atom upwards, is a device of Nature for the extreme of conscious
	individuation.
	Empirically it is immaterial whether it is an image created by consciousness or a real substance of being.
	For practical purposes we may take it as a substantial formation.
	In fact body is a knot of conscious being built up by its own energy, instinct with nervous or subnervous life, —
	because the energy is in dynamic actuality a living energy — cognizing and cognized by subconscious or superficially
	conscious sense, because the energy is in a certain inherent reality a conscious energy.
	It is a knot indivisible in reality from universal Consciousness and Force and Substance but in a certain empirical
	utility of selective action separative rather than separate.
	Body, not really separate, is limited by subconscious instinct of separation and energetic tendency of separation,
	but not capable of effecting real separation.
	All its movements are a practical result of selective experience and selective action which is based on a phenomenon
	of separate physical being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Body is separated from other bodies by intervention of universal matter, but both of the separate bodies are one
	with the indivisible intervening matter, therefore not separate in reality, but indivisibly connected in energy, and
	one matter in fundamental reality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Put otherwise, two bodies are images or formations of one indivisible ethereal space, which is in reality one
	indivisible movement of material energy, life-energy, mind energy.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This inseparable connection and fundamental unity of bodies become of immense importance when we examine the
	relation of the appearances of consciousness to its reality.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 305</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind in body has to begin from the separation proper to body.
	Embodied mind is bound down in its root-action to a separative view of the universe.
	This is its waking view; subliminally, whether in subconscious mentality or where it approaches or touches the
	superconscient being, it is capable of bridging the artificial separation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Taking this separative basis of waking consciousness for itself and for a reality, the house of imprisoned awareness
	from which it looks at the world, it is bound to see objects as external to this awareness and this conscious
	vision.
	Embodied mind is as if a walled house were to have a thinking soul and spirit (air and ether) and look at things not
	in itself as things outside through windows (the senses), receive the touches of the outside air (nervous
	life-impacts) as if other than the air in itself; even its own ether as other than the rest of ether (my soul and
	other souls).
	This is the self and not-self of our mentality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind subliminal is able, though not normally habituated, to bridge the gulf between self and not-self; where it
	approaches the superconscient, this gulf lessens and conscience of oneness grows upon the being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Body is only the instrument and basis of this extreme separative individuation, not its first cause.
	Mind itself is a prior cause; but mentality in itself need not be rigidly separative: especially, subliminal mind
	has a large integrating power.
	Mind in itself is only the basis of a relatively separative plurality; mind in body increases this relation into a
	phenomenon of absolutely separative plurality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	From this basis of externalising individuation and separative plurality waking mental consciousness in the physical
	universe commences its operations.

<p class="P">
	Psychology is the knowledge of consciousness and its operations.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A complete psychology must be a complex of the science of mind, its operations and its relations to life and body
	with intuitive and experimental knowledge of the nature of mind and its relations to supermind and spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A complete psychology cannot be a pure natural science, but must be a compound of science and metaphysical
	knowledge.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 306</p>
<p class="P">
	This necessity arises from the difference between natural or physical sciences and psychology.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A physical science is a knowledge of physical processes which leads inevitably to action and use of physical
	processes.
	The scientist may only regard scientific truth and not utility; but he can find only truth of the process of things,
	not truth of the nature of things.
	His discoveries bring about inevitably<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="103" href="#">1</a> an utility for action; for all
	truth of process is an utility for action.
	Even when not the aim of science, process and utility are the soul and body of physical science.
	Matter itself is only an utility of Spirit or Being or Nature for physical process and action.
	Material energy is an instrumental dynamis for that utility or else an original dynamis which has no other sense of
	its operations.
	We get beyond to a higher sense only when [we] get beyond material to mental, psychical and spiritual energy, to
	mind, soul and spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Debateable it is whether if we knew the real essence of Matter and the basic, not only the apparent, relations of
	mind, soul and spirit to matter and material operations, we could not arrive at an infinitely more potent use of
	physical process and operations.
	But in any case these things cannot be discovered by physical science; it has its limits and cannot exceed its
	limits.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Psychology may begin as a natural science, but it deals already with superphysical and must end in a metaphysical
	enquiry.
	If one side of the process it studies and its method of enquiry is physical, the other and more important is
	non-physical; it is a direct observation of mental operations by mind without any regard to their physiological
	meaning, support, substratum or instrumentation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	If this is in the first place a study of process and involves an utility for psychological action, yet what it leads
	to inevitably is not that action but an enquiry into the nature of mental consciousness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This necessity arises from the immediate perception by mind of something beyond and behind its operations, some
	energy of hidden consciousness greater than our apparent mentality.
	To know what that is, we have to resort to a metaphysical enquiry.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 307</p>
<p class="P">
	Consciousness is itself found to be not essentially a process, — although in mind it appears as a process, but the
	very nature of self-existent being.
	Being or the Self of things can only be known by metaphysical — not necessarily intellectual — knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This self-knowledge has two inseparable aspects, a psychological knowledge of the process of Being, a metaphysical
	knowledge of its principles and essentiality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	We find that one of these principles of being is energy.
	Energy is an eternal and inherent power of conscious being.
	Since all energy is convertible to action, this knowledge also contains a side of psychological and spiritual
	utility, — eventually perhaps even, since life and body are results of the energy of being and supports of its
	action, of vital and physical utility.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Two great utilities open before psychology.
	We may acquire the possibility of a greater being, consciousness and energy.
	We may open up the possibility and discover the psychical means or process [of] becoming consciously one with our
	original self-existent Being, with God, the Absolute, the Transcendence.
	To lead up to these possibilities is the aim of Vedantic psychology.

<p class="P">
	All psychology must result in and every complete statement of psychological truth must have for its frame a double
	schema of existence into which the facts it deals with must fall, a descending scale and an ascending scale.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The simplest elementary psychology deals with three notes of a limited scale, — the body and physical field and its
	impacts, the life and body and biological and physiological processes, the mental being and its conscious experience
	and action.
	This is a scale of ascension.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 308</p>
<p class="P">
	The nature of the physical field is the first fact; it determines everything else; it gives the impacts which awaken
	the consciousness, the impressions, images, subjects which are its matter, the starting-point and basis of all its
	conceptions, the body which is its support, instrument, fulcrum of action, the physical occasion of the sense of
	self.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Everything appears to be in the body or by the body and either for the body or for the I-sense in the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The body seems to be the principal if not the only cause or determinant of individual consciousness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	What is not of the body is of the physical field outside the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Whatever in consciousness seems not to be of the physical field, yet appears to be derived from it, to be a
	resultant, development or deformation from physical experience.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	The life in the body is the necessary modification of the first fact of material being, without whose intervention
	consciousness is unable to manifest in any material form.
	The atom is a form of matter, the stone is a material body, but life in these things is either nil or not developed
	to the point where manifestation of consciousness becomes possible.
	Consciousness in the atom and the stone is either latent, non-manifest to us, suppressed, potential or nil.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Life in any degree is not sufficient for the manifestation of mental consciousness.
	A certain high degree of it or else a certain indispensable kind of organisation is needed for this third tone of
	the scale.
	Plants are living, even in a degree intensely living, they have a nervous organisation, but consciousness is either
	nil or latent, non-manifest at least to us, suppressed or else of another kind than ours, a submental nervous
	consciousness and not mentality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Life supplies certain biological conditions and certain physiological processes which physically underlie the
	operations of conscious mental being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Life gives the intermediate dynamic link between mind and body.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 309</p>
<p class="P">
	Life has two operations which serve the purpose of mentality, a necessary life power in a nervous apparatus and a
	capacity of instrumental development and modification.
	Without the power of life in the nervous apparatus consciousness in the body is impossible; without the power of
	developing modifications it might exist as in the lower animals, but it could not expand as in man.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The nervous apparatus is the initial biological fact necessary to mentality.
	Life power consists not of the nervous system, which is a physical element, but of a new power or energy of which
	the system is the vehicle, — the power of nervous communication, nervous charge, nervous discharge.
	This power is not sufficient to create mentality, for the plant too possesses them, yet does not appear to be a
	mental being, but it is the first condition of embodied mentality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	A power of biological and physiological development is the secondary, continuative factor necessary to farther
	evolution of mentality.
	Once the nervous vital power appears in material body, it shows a biological power of developing a more complex
	physical instrumentation for a more complex nervous activity.
	Once it has attained a certain complexity of physical instrumentation, life seems able indefinitely to refine in
	some subtle way its action of nervous power so as to support a more and more fine and complex action of mentality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	How far this development of mentality can go and how far it is dependent on the physical apparatus and the nervous
	action is one of the capital questions of psychology.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Mental being, power and operation of mental consciousness is the third note of the scale of being.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 310</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind cannot certainly be said to be constituted of life and body, nervous action and reaction in a physical body.
	Nervous action does not appear to constitute of itself consciousness, any more than physical impact and consequent
	atomic disturbance appears of itself to constitute nervous action.
	As a correspondent or resultant nervous communication, charge and discharge is necessary to manifest life, so a
	resultant or correspondent conscious action, — sensation, perception, thought, conscious motiving impulsion, desire,
	intention, will, — are necessary to manifest mind.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind may or may not be an exact result, reflection or correspondence of life action in body, life thinking itself
	out in body, body living and thinking out its experience in mind, but it is not the same thing as life and body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Life is a new or second power emerging from or in material energy.
	Mind is a new or third power emerging from or in the life-energy.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	But this is only the ascending scale.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind is not only awakened by life-action in the body at a certain evolutionary pitch of its operations; mind reacts
	upon and in certain ways uses, for its own characteristic purpose, modifies by its will to act and increase the life
	action and the ways of the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind is not limited in its thoughts by the life and body.
	There is an action in it which is more than a creative stress of life, an attempt to image supraphysical realities,
	which we may dismiss as an illusion or a result of abnormal physiological states, but may also follow as first clues
	to a greater truth and possibly a higher tone or tones of the scale of being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In that case, mind appears as a larger thing than life and material being.
	Though apparently an evolution from life and the body, it may have been in reality a prior power, life and body only
	its occasions and means for self-manifestation on the material plane of being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	At any rate, psychology has to regard the scale not only from the upward point of view of body creating life, life
	creating mind, but from the downward point of view of mind creating new life in body.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 311</p>
<p class="P">
	Evidently mind is a greater thing, higher than life and body.
	In that case, besides the ascending scale of the lower rising to a highest possibility, we must regard a possibility
	of the descending scale, the highest reality involving itself in the lower conditions of being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the question arises whether mind itself is the highest possibility or the highest reality[.]
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Vedantic psychology explores the idea and intuition of a higher reality than mind.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The intuition can only be verified by psychological experience exceeding the normal action of mind.
	This experience may lead to constantly ascending intuitions verified by an ascent of experience to some summit of
	being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Beyond mind psychological experience finds another power of energy, another note in the scale of being.
	This we will call the supermind.
	This supermind lives and acts natively in a domain of experience of which the mind becomes aware by a reflective
	experience and calls vaguely spirit or spiritual being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Spirit is found to have three tones of its being.
	Triune, it makes each successively a power of its energy, a status of spiritual experience and form of its action.
	Triune, they are inseparable, but one or other can be so stressed as to appear a leading principle.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But we have to note three essential facts about spirit: —
</p>
<p class="P">
	Spirit is infinite consciousness, even when it dwells upon finite formulations of conscious being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Awareness of spirit is infinite self-awareness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All its three essential principles must have this character of infinity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Infinite self-conscious bliss is the first; infinite self-conscious conscious energy is the second; infinite
	self-conscious existence the third principle of spirit.
	Existence, consciousness, bliss are the three tones of infinity, the three basic colours of the Absolute.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 312</p>
<p class="P">
	The ascending scale of being presents then seven notes, matter, life, mind, supermind, bliss self, self of conscious
	energy, self of primary conscious existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the experience we get as we ascend in the scale leads us to the discovery that what in evolution appears
	subsequent is prior in reality.
	Life evolves in matter, but was preexistent to matter, latent, omnipresent, waiting for matter to be ready to be
	manifest — which it does when the movement of energy reaches a certain intensity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Mind evolves in embodied life, but was preexistent<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="104" href="#">1</a> to matter and life,
	latent, omnipresent, involved, a hidden cause of action waiting for life and matter to be ready for its
	manifestation which comes when the movement of energy has reached a greater intensity.
	So supermind is prior to mind, latent, omnipresent, involved even in matter and life, a hidden cause of action and
	waits for mind to be ready for its manifestation, and since supermind acts only in spirit spirit too must be there
	latent, omnipresent, involved, a hidden cause of action.
	But spirit is not dependent on the evolution of supermind for its manifestation; it can appear to our mentality, to
	our life-consciousness, even to our physical mind.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The true nature and rationale of this priority appear in the descending scale.
	There we see the true development of the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Spirit of self-being develops self of conscious energy which supports its self of cosmic bliss, which acts on the
	finite by supermind, which offers its differentiations to mind, relates them in life, fixes them phenomenally in
	body of material substance.
	This is the descending scale by which universe is created or made sensible to embodied soul.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But in the material world, all is first involved in matter and has to find itself by a development from material
	being and with material being as its support and basis.
	The evolving process of this self-discovery of the universal existence produces the phenomenon of evolution of
	higher and greater from lower and lesser principles which we call the ascending scale of being.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 313</p>
<p class="P">
	This phenomenon baffling now to the reason becomes a self-evident proposition when we observe the descending scale
	and find involution to have preceded evolution.
	The phenomenon arises inevitably from the nature of our being.
</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>*</b></p>
<p class="P">
	Schema of being has to be formulated from these two points of view, the results, though data of experience, being at
	first taken as a working hypothesis, subject to verification.
	We follow actually the ascending scale, but the descending scale has first to be shown, as otherwise the possible
	explanations of psychological phenomenon which result from this line of experience, would be unintelligible and
	would have either to be excluded or the whole enquiry restated in altered detail in the end.
</p>
<p class="P">
	All questions of the reality or unreality of the world, its fundamental or ultimate purpose or want of purpose, the
	destiny of the soul, must be left over till the psychological data have been understood.
	To proceed otherwise would be to determine them by metaphysical reasoning; but the object before us is to arrive at
	them by the road of psychology.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The whole psychology of Vedanta depends upon this double scale and without it could have no complete scientific
	verification.
	Because it exists experience of consciousness can give a clue to the nature of world existence.
	Metaphysical reasoning by itself could only give us philosophical opinions, psychological verification makes
	Vedantic truth a firm guide in life.
	It gives us a tangible ladder of ascension by which we rise to our highest truth of being[.]

	The knowledge at which psychology arrives in its largest generalisations, is that there is one absolute and
	indefinable Reality which we call for psychological purposes the Self one, indivisible and common to all existence
	which manifests itself with an infinite variety in the universe and that every soul is an individual personality —
	we will use the word for want of a better — of that Self manifesting itself with a variety not precisely infinite,
	but indefinite, but in accordance with its individual nature which provides the principle of harmony, regulates the
	variety, casts it into a certain mould of unity.
	All existence is one, but with a constantly active principle of variation and individuation.
	There is a universal nature of things, but man while abiding within the principles of that nature, has also a nature
	of his own which distinguishes him from the animal and from lower forms of life.
	There is therefore this general individuality of Man which the totality of mankind represents in its full play of
	oneness and variety.
	Within that general individuality there are typal, racial, national, class individualities and each man has his own
	individual nature, one indeed in its general basis and materials with general human nature and with his type, race,
	class, nation, but yet possessed of its own principle of particular individuation.
	It is this which reigns in his mentality, vital being, physical being and stamps itself upon them, but in itself it
	is neither mental, vital nor physical, but proceeds from a secret principle superior to all these; mind, life and
	body are only means and values of his self-expression.
	So is it with every community, nation or other natural grouping of men.

	Towards a True Scientific Psychology

<p class="P">
	When the ancient thinkers of India set themselves to study the soul of man in themselves and others, they, unlike
	any other nation or school of early thought, proceeded at once to a process which resembles exactly enough the
	process adopted by modern science in its study of physical phenomena.
	For their object was to study, arrange and utilise the forms, forces and working movements of consciousness, just as
	the modern physical Sciences study, arrange and utilise the forms, forces and working movements of objective Matter.
	The material with which they had to deal was more subtle, flexible and versatile than the most impalpable forces of
	which the physical Sciences have become aware; its motions were more elusive, its processes harder to fix; but once
	grasped and ascertained, the movements of consciousness were found by Vedic psychologists to be in their process and
	activity as regular, manageable and utilisable as the movements of physical forces.
	The powers of the soul can be as perfectly handled and as safely, methodically and puissantly directed to practical
	life-purposes of joy, power and light as the modern power of electricity can be used for human comfort, industrial
	and locomotive power and physical illumination; but the results to which they give room and effect are more
	wonderful and momentous than the results of motorpower and electric luminosity.
	For there is no difference of essential law in the physical and the psychical, but only a difference and undoubtedly
	a great difference of energy, instrumentation and exact process.
	The Supreme Existence which expresses itself equally in soul and matter, moves upon one fundamental principle on all
	its sevenfold levels, and even by one set of medial processes, but It varies their minute arrangement and organic
	functioning to suit the material which it is using and the objective which it has set before Itself in Its divine
	movement.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 316</p>
<p class="P">
	Exact observation and untrammelled, yet scrupulous experiment are the method of every true Science.
	Not mere observation by itself — for without experiment, without analysis and new-combination observation leads to a
	limited and erroneous knowledge; often it generates an empirical classification which does not in the least deserve
	the name of science.
	The old European system of psychology was just such a pseudo-scientific system.
	Its observations were superficial, its terms and classification arbitrary, its aim and spirit abstract, empty and
	scholastic.
	In modern times a different system and method are being founded; but the vices of the old system persist.
	The observations made have been incoherent, partial or morbid and abnormal; the generalisations are far too wide for
	their meagre substratum of observed data; the abstract and scholastic use of psychological terms and the old
	metaphysical ideas of psychological processes still bandage the eyes of the infant knowledge, mar its truth and
	hamper its progress.
	These old errors are strangely entwined with a new fallacy which threatens to vitiate the whole enquiry, — the
	fallacy of the materialistic prepossession.

	Psychology ought to be rather than is the science of consciousness and of the motions of consciousness as
	distinguished from the science of form and of the motions of form.
	We are dealing, therefore, in psychology with a more subtle, flexible and versatile material than in the physical
	sciences; its motions are more elusive, its processes harder to fix; but when once grasped and ascertained, its laws
	and activities are found to be quite as regular, manageable and utilisable as the processes of physical Nature.
	They give room to even more wonderful and momentous results.
	There is no difference of essential law in the physical and psychical, but a great difference of instrumentation and
	exact process.
	For the Supreme Existence moves on one fundamental principle or one set of principles in all its manifestations, but
	varies its organic arrangement and functioning of the principles to suit the material which It is using and the
	objective which It intends to reach.
	In both fields observation and experiment are the only sound foundation of knowledge.
	But observation without experiment leads only to a limited and erroneous science, often to an empirical system of
	surface rules which do not deserve the name of science at all.
	It is this defect which has so long kept European psychology in the status of a pseudo-science; and, even now when
	real observation has begun and experimentation of an elementary kind is being attempted, the vices of the perishing
	sciolism mar and hamper this infant knowledge.
	It has not rid itself of all its old scholastic swaddling clothes; therefore it still walks on all fours and cannot
	yet learn to stand up erect and walk.

	All that is our self, our being, — what we see at the top is only our ego and its visible nature.

	that is below or behind and supplies it — and know too all that is around it and above.
</p>
<p class="P">
	For below this conscient nature is the vast Inconscient out of which we come.
	The Inconscient is greater, deeper, more original, more potent to shape and govern what we are and do than our
	little derivative conscient nature.
	Inconscient to us, to our surface view, but not inconscient in itself or to itself it is a sovereign guide, worker,
	determinant, creator.
	Not to know it is not to know our nether origins and the origin of the most part of what we are and do.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 318</p>
<p class="P">
	And the Inconscient is not all.
	For behind our little frontal ego and nature is a whole subliminal kingdom of inner consciousness with many planes
	and provinces.
	There are in that kingdom many powers, movements, personalities which are part of ourselves and help to form our
	little surface personality and its powers and movements.
	This inner self, these inner persons we do not know, but they know us and observe and dictate our speech, our
	thoughts, feelings, doings even more directly than the Inconscient below us.

	This Circumconscience is pouring its forces, suggestions, stimulus, compulsions into us at every moment of our

	Around us is a universal Mind of which our mind is a formation and our thoughts, feelings, will, impulses are

	But by this method we can only arrive at an extended physiological, not at a true psychological knowledge.
	We learn that there is a physical instrumentation by which physical things and their contacts work upon our
	consciousness, reach it through the nerves and the brain and awake certain reactions in it which may however vary
	with the brain and the consciousness contacted; we learn that the consciousness uses certain physiological processes
	as well as physical means to act upon outward things and conditions; we learn too that physical conditions have an
	action upon our state of consciousness and its functionings.
	But all this was to be expected, since we are a consciousness embodied and not disincarnate, acting through a body

	The problem of consciousness can only be solved if we go back to a radical state of our existence in which things
	get back to their reality.
	For there they are no longer a mass of phenomena which have to be cleared up, classified, organised by the
	perceptions, conceptions and relative logic of the human intellect.
	These perceptions, these concepts, this logic belong to an imperfect instrument and the arrangements they make can
	only be provisional and, at that, onesided and only half-true or a good deal less than half-true — and even that

	In fact the intellect sees only the phenomenon, it cannot go back behind it; when it tries, it only arrives at other

	The truth of things can only be perceived when one gets to what may be called summarily the spiritual vision of

	Consciousness is not an unaccountable freak or a chance growth or a temporary accident in a material and inconscient
	universe.
	It may so appear on the surface and physical science, since by its very terms it is limited to the examination of
	appearances and must start from the surface phenomenon, may choose or may have no alternative but to treat it on
	that basis.
	But surface appearances are not the reality of things, they may be a part of the truth but they are not the whole
	reality.
	One must look beyond the external appearances of things before one can know things in themselves: especially first
	appearances are apt to be deceptive.
	It is not by regarding a flash of lightning as a chance ebullition of fiery temper in a cloud that one can know the
	truth of electricity.
	We must go far and dig deep before we can get at the truth about the Force that manifested the lightning.
	Consciousness may similarly appear as a phenomenon, an outbreak of sentience in the obscurity of an originally
	nescient being; but we must go far beyond that specious appearance if we would know the true nature and origin and
	discover the entire possibilities of this apparently strange and anomalous force.
	For anomalous it is, since it occurs in a fundamentally inconscient universe of Matter and strange and curious it is
	in its reactions, aberrations, workings, destiny.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Physical science — and psychology in its present methods is only an extension of physical science — conducts its
	search into things from down upwards; it regards Matter as the foundation and the bottom of things and having
	searched into that foundation, got as it thinks to the very bottom, it believes, or once believed, it has by that
	very fact understood their depths, their centre, their height and top.
	But this is a naive error.
	The truth of things is in their depths or at their centre and even at their top.
	The truth of consciousness also is to be found at its top and in its depths or at its centre; but when we enter into
	the depths of consciousness or when we try to reach its centre, we go off into trance and likewise before we get to
	its top, we go off into trance.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 322</p>
<p class="P">
	Our searches into Matter also are vitiated by the fact that in Matter consciousness is in a trance and gives no
	apparent response to our probings.
	In living Matter, not yet mental, still subconscious, it does give sometimes a reply, but not one that we can
	understand, and, as for mind in the animal, it is only consciousness half awakened out of the original trance of
	inconscient Matter: even in the human being it starts from an original nescience, its expressions, its data, all
	that we can ordinarily observe of it, are the movements of Ignorance fumbling for knowledge.
	We cannot understand from these alone what consciousness really is nor discover its source or its supreme
	possibilities or its limits, if indeed it has any limits and is not like being itself infinite and illimitable.
	Only if we can get away from this imperfection and ignorance to some top of its possibilities or to its latent
	depths or some hidden centre, can we discover its true nature and through it the very self and reality of our being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	How do we know that there is a top to consciousness or an inner centre, since these are not apparent on the face of
	things?
	By its supernormal, not its normal manifestations and phenomena, for the top of things is always supernormal, it is
	only the bottom and what is near to the bottom that are normal, at any rate to our ordinary consciousness in the
	material universe.
	Especially we can know by the supernormal becoming normal to us — by Yoga.

	I mean by Yogic psychology an examination of the nature and movements of consciousness as they are revealed to us by
	the processes and results of Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This definition at once takes us out of the field of ordinary psychology and extends the range of our observation to
	an immense mass of facts and experiments which exceed the common surface and limited range very much as the vastly
	extended range of observation of Science exceeds that of the common man looking at natural external phenomena only
	with the help [of] his unaided mind and senses.
	The field of Yoga is practically unlimited and its processes and instrumentation have a plasticity and adaptability

<p class="pg-num">Page 323</p>
<p class="P">
	It is true that modern psychology has probed the internal law of living matter and consciousness and arrived at
	results which are remarkable but limited and fundamentally inconclusive.
	We know from it that the movements of consciousness are affected and on a certain side determined by the functioning
	of the physical organs.
	But still the nature, origin and laws of consciousness remain unknown; all that has been proved is that the body
	provides for it an engine or instrumentation for its manifestation in living physical bodies and that certain
	lesions, alterations or deteriorations of the engine may lead to considerable or serious results in the functioning
	of the embodied consciousness.
	This was to be expected and can at once be conceded; but there is no proof that consciousness is a function of
	matter or that it was originated by the chemical or biological processes of the body or that it perishes with the
	dissolution of life in the body.
	The cessation of its functioning in the body at death proves nothing, for that was to be expected whatever the
	origin of consciousness or its fundamental nature.
	Its disappearance may be a departure, a disappearance from the body, but not a disappearance from existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is true also that modern inquiry probing into psychological (as opposed to physiological) phenomena has
	discovered certain truths that are equally discovered by Yogic process, the role of the subconscient, the
	subliminal, double or multiple personality; but its observations in these fields are of an extremely groping and
	initial character and one does not see easily how it can arrive at the same largeness of results here as in
	physiology, physics, chemistry or other departments of physical Science.
</p>
<p class="P">
	It is only by Yoga process that one can arrive at an instrumentation which will drive large wide roads into the
	psychological Unknown and not only obscure and narrow tunnels.
	The field of psychology needs a direct inner psychological instrumentation by which we can arrive at sure data and
	sure results in ourselves verified [by] equally sure data [and] results in our observation of others and of the
	hidden psychological world and its play of unseen forces.
	The physical is the outwardly seen and sensed and needs physical instruments for its exploration; the psychological
	is the physically unseen and unsensed, to be discovered only by an organisation of the inward senses and other now
	undeveloped and occult means.
	It is through consciousness, by an instrumentation of consciousness only that the nature and laws and movements of
	consciousness can be discovered — and this is the method of Yoga.

	self-intensification and self-extension of the mind and whatever in us is limited and that by which we enter into a
	larger deeper consciousness than is ordinarily ours.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This consciousness is aware of external things not only through the physical mind and senses but by other though
	often similar means of Mind, an inner sense or senses, an inner tact or feeling such as a projective or responsive
	awareness of things at a slight or great distance, a premonitory sense of things about to happen [or] preparing to
	happen, a feeling of things or persons not seen, an inner vision of physical objects and happenings not before the
	eye and hundreds of other phenomena not normal to the ordinary mind.
	These phenomena are ordinarily labelled occult or psychic or described as hallucinatory according to the point of
	view of the speaker, but such epithets explain nothing.

	consciousness an examination of them is imperative.

<p class="pg-num">Page 329</p>

	This range of phenomena is however only an outer fringe of Yoga.

	spirit, to deepest realities and [?finally] to the deepest of all; [... ...]
</p>
<p class="P">
	But what precisely do we mean by the word Yoga?
	It is used here in the most general sense possible as a convenient name including all processes or results of
	processes that lead to the unveiling of a greater and inner knowledge, consciousness, experience.
	Any psychic discipline by which we can pass partly or wholly into a spiritual state of the consciousness, any
	spontaneous or systematised approach to the inner Reality or the supreme Reality, any state of union or closeness to
	the Divine, any entry into a consciousness larger, deeper or higher than the normal consciousness common to
	humankind, fall automatically within the range of the word Yoga.
	Yoga takes us from the surface into the depths of our consciousness or it admits us into its very centre; it takes
	us up to the hidden topmost heights of our conscious being.
	It shows to us the secrets of the Self and the secret of the Divine.
	It gives us the knowledge, the vision, the presence of the Immanent and the Cosmic and the Transcendent Reality;
	that is its supreme purpose.
	On a lower grade it gives us the key to an inner and larger consciousness that is subliminal to us and brings out
	its experiences, its powers and possibilities and unless we know these things the secret of Consciousness and the
	knowledge of our whole being must escape us.
	It is through this door that we pass from a nescience of our true nature into a full light of self-knowledge.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 330</p>
<p class="P">
	But there are methods, schools, disciplines of Yoga that are turned towards one restricted aim, follow each a
	different path, win control of a separate province and by following that exclusive path we shall know that province
	of our being only or reach a single summit.
	It is by the integrality of Yoga that one can attain the integrality of consciousness.
	Our aim must be to embrace in this new knowledge all the planes of consciousness and all its summits.
	Then in the light of the knowledge brought to us and its widening and heightening of our consciousness, it is in the
	light of the top of things that we have to see and know all.
	It is then only that our ignorance or a very partial and surface awareness of ourselves can be flooded by a light of
	self-revelation and turn into self-knowledge.

	This self or true being remains constant through all the changes of our phenomenal being, changes of the mind, life
	or body or changes of our apparent personality; it is permanent, perpetual and immortal, a portion or manifestation
	of the Eternal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	By Yoga we pass also from our consciousness of the phenomenal appearance or appearances of the cosmos or world
	around us to a consciousness of its truth and reality.
	We become aware of the world as a manifestation of or in universal being who is the true truth of all that we see,
	hear, experience.
	We become aware of a cosmic Consciousness which is the secret of the cosmic Energy, a cosmic Self or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="106" href="#">1</a> Spirit, the cosmic Divine, the universal Godhead.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 331</p>
<p class="P">
	But by Yoga we become aware also that our own Self or true being is one with the cosmic Self and Spirit, our nature
	a play of the cosmic Nature; the wall between ourselves and the universe begins to disappear and vanishes
	altogether.
	We realise the selfsame Pantheos in ourselves, in others and in all universal existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But also by Yoga we become aware of something that is more than our individual being and more than the cosmic being,
	a transcendent Being or Existence which is not dependent on ours or the existence of the universe.
	Our existence is a manifestation of and in that Being, the cosmos also is a manifestation of and in that one Supreme
	Existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This then is the Truth or Reality to which we arrive by Yoga, a one and supreme Being or Existence and Power of
	Being which manifests as a cosmic Self or Spirit and a cosmic Energy or Nature and in that again as our own self or
	spirit which becomes aware of itself as an individual being and nature.

<p class="P">
	It is the aim of all Yoga to pass by a change of consciousness into the Reality that is behind things and live no
	longer in their appearance.
	To enter into some kind of union or communion or participation in that is the common object of all Yoga.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 332</p>
<p class="P">
	But the Reality presents itself to the consciousness of man the mental being under many aspects.
	We seek after union or closeness to the Divine, whatever the Divine may be.
	We see the Divine as a personal Godhead or as an impersonal Existence.
	A God of Love or compassion attracts us or a God of might and power.
	It is a divine Friend who meets us or a Divine Master or a World Father or World Mother or an almighty Lord of all
	or a Divine Lover.
	We are in the presence of a Cosmic Spirit in whose universal consciousness we lose our separate ego or a Supracosmic
	Absolute in whom we lose altogether our cosmic as well as our individual existence.
	We find our own highest Self or the Self of all or we pass into a sublime Mystery without relation or feature where
	neither self nor all can exist any longer.
	Or it may be the inexpressible mystery of an original Nihil that abolishes for us all suffering along with all
	existence — or else that Nihil may be a mystic All that is far other than the false and illusory being created for
	us by mind and life experience.

	Yoga Partial and Complete
</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">126</h4>
<p class="pg-num">Page 335</p>
<p class="P">
	Yoga means union and the whole object of Yoga is the union of the human soul with the supreme Being and of the

<p class="P">
	The greater the union, the greater the Yoga, the more complete the union, the more complete the Yoga.

	Most of them lead away from life and are useful only to the few who are moved to turn away from human existence and

<p class="P">
	The aim put before itself by Yoga is God; its method is tapasya.
</p>
<p class="P">
	God is the All and that which exceeds and transcends the All; there is nothing in existence which is not God but God
	is not anything in that existence, except symbolically, in image to His own consciousness.
	Humanity also is a symbol or eidolon of God, we are made in His image; and by that is meant, not a formal image, but
	in the image of His being and personality, the essence of divinity and its quality, the divine being and divine
	knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There are in every thing existing phenomenally or, as we shall say, symbolically, two parts, the thing in itself and
	the symbol, Self and Nature, res (thing that is) and factum (thing that is made), immutable being and mutable
	becoming, that which is supernatural in it and that [which] is natural.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 336</p>
<p class="P">
	Everything in existence has something in it which seeks to transcend itself; Matter moves towards becoming Life,
	Life moves towards becoming Mind, Mind moves towards becoming ideal Truth, ideal Truth rises to become divine and
	infinite Spirit.
	The reason is that every symbol, being a partial expression of God, reaches out to and seeks to become its own
	entire reality; it aspires to become its real self by transcending its apparent self.
	Thing that is made is attracted towards Thing that is, becoming towards being, the natural to the supernatural,
	symbol towards Thing in itself, Nature towards God.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The upward movement is the means towards fulfilment of existence in the world; downward movement is destruction,
	Hell, perdition.
	Everything tends [to] move upward; once it is assured of its natural existence, it seeks the supernatural.
	Every nature is a step towards some supernature, something natural to itself but supernatural to what is below it.
	Life is supernatural to Matter, Mind supernatural to Life, ideal being supernatural to mental being, infinite being
	supernatural to ideal being.
	So too man is supernatural to the animal, God is supernatural to man.
	Man too as soon as he has assured his natural existence, must insist on his upward movement towards God.
	The upward movement is towards Heaven, the downward movement towards Hell.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The animal soul fulfils itself when it transcends animality and becomes human.
	Humanity also fulfils itself when it transcends humanity and becomes God.
</p>
<p class="P">
	By yielding to Nature, we fall away both from Nature and from God; by transcending Nature we at once fulfil all the
	possibilities of Nature and rise towards God.
	The human touches first the divine and then becomes divine.
</p>
<p class="P">
	There are those who seek to kill Nature in order to become the Self; but that is not God's intention in humanity.
	We have to transcend Nature, not to kill it.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Every movement of humanity which seeks to destroy Nature, however religious, lofty or austere, of whatever dazzling
	purity of ethereality, is doomed to failure, sick disappointment, disillusionment or perversion.
	It is in its nature transient, because it contradicts God's condition for us.
	He has set Nature there as a condition of His self-fulfilment in the world.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 337</p>
<p class="P">
	Every movement of humanity which bids us be satisfied with Nature, dwell upon the earth and cease to look upwards,
	however rational, clearsighted, practical, effective, comfortable it may be is doomed to weariness, petrifaction and
	cessation.
	It is in its nature transient because it contradicts God's intention in us.
	He dwells secret in Nature and compels us towards Him by His irresistible attraction.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Materialistic movements are as unnatural and abnormal as ascetic and negatory religions and philosophies.
	Under the pretence of bringing us back to Nature, they take us away from her entirely; for they forget that Nature
	is only phenomenally Nature but in reality she is God.
	The divine element in her is that which she most really is; the rest is only condition, process and stage in her
	development of the secret divinity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Not to be ensnared, emmeshed and bound by Nature, not to hate and destroy her, is the first thing we must learn if
	we would be complete Yogins and proceed towards our divine perfection.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Being still natural in the world to transcend Nature internally so that both internally and externally we may master
	and use her as free and lord, swarat samrat, is our fulfilment.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Being still the symbol to reach through it the thing that symbolises itself, to realise the symbol, is our
	fulfilment.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Being still a figure of humanity, man among men, a living body among living bodies, though housed in life and matter
	yet a mental being among mental beings, being and remaining all this that we are apparently, yet to exceed all this
	apparent manhood and become in the body what we are really, God, spirit, supreme and infinite, pure Bliss, pure
	Force, pure Light, this is our fulfilment.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Our whole apparent life is a becoming, but all becoming has for its goal and fulfilment being and God is the only
	being; to become divine in the nature of the world, in the symbol of humanity is our fulfilment.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Yoga in its practice may be either perfect or partial, either selective or comprehensive.
	Perfect and comprehensive Yoga avoids limitations by aspects and leads to entire divinity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 338</p>
<p class="P">
	If we are to exceed our human stature and become divine, we must first, in our Indian phrase, get God; for this
	human ego is the lower imperfect term of our being, God is its higher perfect term.
	God in us is the possessor of our super-nature and without Him there is no effectual rising.
	The finite cannot become infinite, unless it perceives and desires to touch its own secret infinity; nor can the
	symbol-being, unless it knows, loves<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="107" href="#">1</a> and pursues its Self-Reality,
	overcome the present limits of its merely apparent nature.
	This necessity is the imperative justification of religion, — not of a church, creed or theology; for these things
	are all outward religiosity rather than the truth of religion, but of that personal and intimate religion, a thing
	of temper and spirit and life, not of views or ceremonies which draws each man to his own vision of the Supreme or
	his own idea of something higher than himself.
	Without the worship of the Supreme in the heart, the aspiration towards it in the will or the thirst for it in the
	temperamental cravings we shall not have the impulse or the strength for the difficult and supreme effort demanded
	of us.
	Therefore have the prophets spoken and the Avatars descended, so that mankind may be inspired to this great call
	upon its upward-straining energies.
	The aim of rationalism and Science is to make man content with his humanity and contradict Nature, baffling her
	evolution; the aim of religion, — but not unhappily of the creeds and Churches — is to farther the great aim of
	Nature by pushing man towards his evolution.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 339</p>
<p class="P">
	The attainment of God is the true object of all human effort for which all his other efforts political, social,
	literary, intellectual, are only a necessary condition and preparation of the race; but then there are both
	differences in the state of the attainment, differences in its range and effectivity.
	Three states of divine attainment may usefully be distinguished, touch with God, indwelling in Him and becoming He.
	The first is initial and elementary; unless passing the veil of our ordinary nature we touch the divine Being or He
	leaning down impose His touch [on] us, unless we come first into contact with Him either in our heart, our mind, our
	works or our being, we cannot go on to indwell in Him.
	If we are strong in spirit, the touch may indeed be rapid and summary and we may wake at once and stride forward to
	the state of divine indwelling, soul of man in the soul of God, the individual in the universal; but the touch must
	be there.
	To enforce this preliminary step, to bring man into some kind of contact with God, is the common and sometimes the
	sole preoccupation of human religions.
	It does not matter greatly to Nature for her purpose how it is done, — in however crude and elementary a way,
	through whatever intellectual errors and emotional blunders or ethical outrages, the touch must be established; this
	imperatively and above all things the religious spirit demands.
	Nature, as is always her way, presses on to her all-important, immediate steps and is willing to purchase a single
	great and general gain by any number of particular losses.
	Man, besides, is so various in the arrangement of his human qualities, the master spring as well as the peculiar
	temperament differs so greatly or so subtly in each individual that there can never be, for this purpose of
	Nature's, too many sects, disciplines or different religions.
	Swami Vivekananda has well seen the consummation of religion in a state when each human individual<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="108" href="#">2</a> has his own religion dictated by his own spiritual needs and nature; for collective
	creeds, Churches and theologies, in spite of their temporary necessity and some undeniable permanent advantages,
	help to formalise the upward effort and deprive it of its adaptability, freedom and perfect individual sincerity.
	The priest and dogma will seldom leave God and the soul free to meet each other in that solitude and spontaneity
	which gives the union its highest force and delight.
	They are always pressing in to control and preside at the marriage and legitimise it with formulas, rites and
	official registration.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 340</p>
<p class="P">
	Moreover the intellect of natural man is narrow, his effort soon exhausted and easily satisfied with imperfection.
	If he is led to think that his way of contact with the Divine is the only way, his own freedom of higher development
	is fettered or entirely taken away from him and in his intellectual and religious egoism he militates against the
	freedom of others.
	Most religions tend easily to believe that the contact with God once established, no matter with what limitations or
	of what kind, all is done that needs to be done, all fulfilled that God demands of us.
	Popular religions tend naturally to be dualistic and to preserve a trenchant distinction between man and God
	dividing the symbol being from That which expresses itself in him; while with one hand they raise man towards his
	super-nature, with the other they hold him down to his ordinary nature.
	The lower is suffused with the glow of the higher and touched with its power and rapture, but it does not itself
	rise into and dwell within it.
	At its lowest the dualistic soul cherishes the taint of its imperfections, at its highest, unless in rare
	self-transcending moments, keeps itself distinct in awe and reverence from the divine Lover, worships at His feet
	but cannot hide itself in His bosom.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 341</p>
<p class="P">
	Therefore Nature, still following her upward surge, has provided a mightier rank of human souls who are capable of
	going forward beyond this preliminary effort and having entered into the very being of God, of dwelling there in
	beatitude.
	Entering into the consciousness of the Infinite, feeling it all around them and in them, ever thrilling with its
	touch, aware of identity with It in nature, joy and inner awareness, they yet preserve a constant separateness of
	their special being in that identity.
	They do not plunge themselves wholly into the divine ocean or, if they go down into it, they keep hold on a
	fathomline which will preserve their touch with the surface.
	In their nature — whatever be their opinions — such men are Visishtadwaitins, souls not drawn towards entire
	oneness.
	But unless man plunges himself wholly into God caring not whether he reemerge, unless the human sacrifices himself
	wholly to the divinity, keeping back no particle of his being, not even the least particle of separateness of the
	individual ego, Jivatman, the divine purpose in man cannot be utterly accomplished.
	Therefore Nature or the Will of God — for Nature is nothing but the Will of God in action — has provided that some,
	having indwelt in God, human soul in divine soul, shall be irresistibly called immediately, with brief respite or at
	long and last to the utter immersion.
	These go onward and throw away the last trace of Ego into God.
	Some of us, it has been said by a great teacher, are jivakotis, human beings leaning so preeminently to the
	symbol-nature that, if they have lost it utterly for a while in the Reality, they lose themselves; once immersed,
	they cannot return; they are lost in God to humanity; others are ishwarakotis, human beings whose centre has already
	been shifted upwards or, elevated in the superior planes of our conscious-existence from the beginning, was
	established in God rather than in Nature.
	Such men are already leaning down from God to Nature; they, therefore, even in losing themselves in Him yet keep
	themselves since in reaching God they do not depart from their centre but rather go towards it; arrived they are
	able to lean down again to humanity.
	Those who can thus emerge from this bath of God are the final helpers of humanity and are chosen by God and Nature
	to prepare the type of supernatural man to which our humanity is rising.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 342</p>
<p class="P">
	There are, then, these three divine conditions, states separately conceived of humanity's God attainment.
	Man being limited in energy and discriminative rather than catholic in intellect, fastens usually on this separate
	conception and limits himself to one or other of these conditions; Yogic method, also, being careful of the
	different natures of men, suits itself to their limitations, becomes selective and concentrates upon one of these
	conditions or another.
	Or even it becomes partial as well as selective; for in its contact with God, it relates itself to a part of divine
	quality rather than the perfect divinity, to a God of mercy, the God of Justice, the Divine Master, the Divine
	Friend, or else with some aspect of divine impersonal being, to Infinite Rapture, to Infinite Force or to Infinite
	Calm and Purity.
	In the indwelling there may be the same limitations, in the becoming also they may persist.
	There is no fault to be found with this selective process or with this partiality.
	They are necessary; human limitations demand this device; human perfectibility itself finds its account in these
	concessions.
	Nature knows her task and she proceeds to it with a wide, flexible and perfect wisdom which smiles at our impatient
	logical narrownesses and rigid, onesighted consistencies.
	She knows she has an infinitely complex and variable material to deal with and must be infinitely complex and
	variable in her methods.
	We only consider precise method and ultimate fulfilment; she has to reckon on her way with thousand-armed struggles
	and infinite possibilities.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Nevertheless, her ultimate aim and the perfect and comprehensive Yoga is that which embraces rather than selects.
	We are meant to be within the symbol of humanity what God is in Himself and universally.
	Now God is free, absolute from these limitations and all-comprehensive.
	He is always one in his being, yet both one with and separate from his symbols and in that differentiated oneness
	able to stand quite apart from them.
	So we too in our ultimate divine realisation when we have become one with our divine Self, may and should be able
	also to stand out as the self still one in all things and beings, yet differentiated in the symbol, so as to enjoy a
	blissful divided closeness such as that of the Lover and Beloved mingling yet separate in their rapture; and may and
	should even be able to stand away from God with a sort of entire separateness holding His hand still, unlike the
	pure dualist, but still standing away from Him so that we may enjoy that infinity of human relation with God which
	is the wonder and beauty and joy of dualistic religions.
	To accomplish this is the full, the purna Yoga, and the sadhak who can attain to it, is in his condition the
	complete Yogin.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 343</p>
<p class="P">
	Is such a triune condition of the soul possible?
	Logically, it would seem impossible; logically, all trinities are chimeras and a thing must be one thing at a time
	and cannot combine three such divergent states as oneness, differentiated oneness and effective duality.
	But in these matters an inch of experience runs farther than a yard of logic, and experience, you will find, affirms
	that the triune God-state is perfectly possible and simple once you have attained God's fullness.
	We must not apply to the soul a logic which is based on the peculiarities of matter.
	It is true of a clod that it cannot be at the same time a clod hanging up or pasted on some bough, a clod protruding
	from the earth and a shapeless mass trodden into the mother soil.
	But this is because the clod is divided from the earthly form.
	The soul is not divided from God by these barriers of material and dimension.
	What is true [of] matter is not true of Spirit, nor do the standards of form become facts applied to the formless.
	For matter is conscious being confined in form, the spirit is conscious being using form but unconfined in it; and
	it is the privilege of Spirit that though indivisible in its pure being, it is freely self-divisible in its
	conscious experience and can concentrate itself in many states at a time.

</p>
<p class="P">
	The ideals created by the mind are constructions in the air that have no sufficient foundation in our vital and
	physical nature; therefore they can change a side of our mind and colour a part of our actions, but they cannot
	transform our lives, cannot find here their physical body.
	Ideals touch and pass, mankind remains the same; after religions, ideals, moralities without end we keep always the
	same ignorant and imperfect human nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Moral rules and ideals are a harness for the ignorant soul, bridle and bit for the passions, reins that compel it to
	an assigned road, yoke and poles and traces that bind it to be faithful to the burden it carries.
	Morality checks and controls but does not purify or change the vital nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	In ethics there is an artificial shaping of the mind's surfaces, but no spiritual freedom, no satisfying perfection
	of the whole dynamic nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The mind's ideals like the life's seekings are at once absolute each in its own demand and in conflict with one
	another; neither mind nor life knows the means either of their complete or their harmonised fulfilment.
	The mind labours through the centuries but human nature remains faithful to its imperfections and man's life amid
	its changes always the same.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Beyond mind on spiritual and supramental levels dwells the Presence, the Truth, the Power, the Bliss that can alone
	deliver us from these illusions, display the Light of which our ideals are tarnished disguises and impose the
	harmony that shall at once transfigure and reconcile all the parts of our nature.

<p class="P">
	The progressive surrender of our ignorant personal will and its merger into a greater divine or on the highest
	summits greatest supreme Will is the whole secret of Karma Yoga.
	To bring about the conditions in which alone this vast and happy identity becomes possible and to work out the lines
	we must follow to their end if we are to reach it, is all the deeper purpose of this discipline.
	The first condition is the elimination of personal vital desire, for if desire intervenes, all harmony with the
	supreme Divine Will becomes impossible.
	Even if we receive it, we shall disfigure its working and distort its dynamic impulse.
	To give up all desire, all insistence upon fruit and reward and success must be renounced from our will and all
	vital attachment to the work itself excised from our nature; for attachment makes it our own and no longer the
	Godhead's.
	The elimination of egoism is the second condition, not only of the rajasic and tamasic egoisms that twine<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">1</a> around desire, but of the sattwic egoism that takes refuge in the
	idea of the I as the worker.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 352</p>
<p class="P">
	The ordinary consciousness of man cannot accept this difficult renunciation or, if it accepts it, cannot achieve
	this tremendous change.
	The human mind is too ignorant, narrow and chained to its own limited movements, the human life-instincts too blind,
	selfish, obscure, shut up in their own earth-bound pursuits and satisfactions, the human body too clumsy and
	hampering a machine.
	There is here no freedom, no large and infinite room, no willing and happy plasticity for the greater play of the
	Divine in Nature.
	A certain half-seeing and imperfect subordination of the personal will to an ill-understood greater Will and Power,
	a stumbling and occasional intuition or at best a brilliant lightninglike intimation of its commands and impulsions,
	a confused, clouded and often grossly distorted execution of the little one seizes of a divine Mandate seems to be
	the uttermost that the human consciousness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="112" href="#">2</a> as it is at its best seems
	able to accomplish.
	Only by a growth into a greater superhuman and supramental consciousness whose very nature is to be attuned to the
	Divine can we achieve the true and supreme Karma Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This transformation is only possible after certain steps of a divine ascent have been mastered and to climb these
	steps is the object of the Yoga of Works as it is conceived by the Gita.
	The extirpation of desire, a wide and calm equality of the mind, the life soul and the spirit, annihilation of the
	ego, an inner quietude and expulsion or transcendence of ordinary Nature, the Nature of the three gunas and a total
	surrender to the Supreme are the successive steps of this preliminary change.
	Only after all this has been done, can we live securely in an infinite consciousness not bound like our mental human
	nature.
	And only then can we receive the Light, know perfectly the will of the Supreme, attune all our movements to the
	rhythm of its Truth and execute perfectly from moment to moment its imperative commandments.
	Till then there is no firm achievement, but only an endeavour, seeking and aspiration, all the stress and struggle
	of a great and uncertain spiritual adventure.
	Only when these things are accomplished is there for the dynamic parts of our nature the beginning of a divine
	security in its acts and a transcendent peace.

	The Supramental Yoga
</h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">156</h4>
<p class="pg-num">Page 362</p>
<p class="P">
	All Yoga is in its very nature a means of passing out of our surface consciousness of limitation and ignorance into
	a larger and deeper Reality of ourselves and the world and some supreme or total Existence now veiled to us by this
	surface.
	There is a Reality which underlies everything, permeates perhaps everything, is perhaps everything but in quite
	another way than the world now seen by us; to It we are obscurely moving by our thought, life and actions; we
	attempt to understand and approach by our religion and philosophy, at last we touch directly in some partial or, it
	may be, some complete spiritual experience.
	It is that spiritual experience, it is the method, it is the attainment of this realisation that we call Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But the Reality is an Absolute or an Infinite; our consciousness, even our spiritualised consciousness is that of a
	finite being.
	It is inevitable therefore that our spiritual experience should be not that of a concrete integrality of this
	Absolute or Infinite, but of aspects of it; we are, so long at least as we are mental beings, the blind men of the
	story trying to tell what the Elephant Infinite is in its totality by our touch upon a part of it, some member of
	its spiritual body, tanum svam.
	One experiences it as Self or Spirit.
	It may be a Self of himself in which he finds his spiritual consummation, integrality, infinity, perfection.
	It may be a Self of the universe in which his individuality loses itself forever.
	It may be a Self transcendent in which the Ego disappears, but cosmos too is annulled forever in a formless Eternal
	and Infinite.
	Another may experience it as God; and God may be either the All of the Pantheist, a cosmic Spirit, an individual
	Deity, a supracosmic Creator; or all of these together.
	A Personal Godhead may be the spiritual Form in which He presents Himself to us or rather He may reject forms from
	his being [and] resolve Himself into an impersonal Existence.
	Moreover each of these aspects of the Reality can be variously experienced; for each suits itself to the grasp of
	our consciousness, even though it can be very apparent that it is the same Reality that these variations differently
	account for.
	But also there may [be] other realisations of the Reality such as the Zero of the Nihilistic Buddhists which is yet
	a mysterious All, a negation that is a positive Permanence.
	It is an error to take these variations as a proof that spiritual experience is unreliable.
	All religions, all philosophies are equally desperate in their attempts to give an account of the Real and Ultimate;
	science itself for all its matter of fact physical positivism draws back bewildered from the attempt to touch the
	Real and Ultimate.
	It is the nature of Mind to arrive at this result of uncertain certainty; our experience is true but it is not and
	cannot be the sole possible integral experience.

	All Yoga has one supreme object; a permanent liberation from the ignorance and weakness of this limited and
	suffering human and earthly consciousness is its purpose and either an escape or a growth and swift flowering into a
	greater consciousness beyond mind, life and body, into a wider and diviner existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	But this greater consciousness is differently conceived by different seekers, for in itself it is to the mind
	unseizably infinite.
	One, but multitudinously one, it presents itself in a million aspects.
	To some it appears as a great permanent Negative or a magnificent,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="117" href="#">1</a> a
	happy annihilation of all that we know as an existence.
	To others it is a featureless Absolute; the annihilation of personality and world-Nature is its key and silence and
	an ineffable peace its gate of our entrance.
	To others it is a Supreme, positive beyond all positives, an<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="118" href="#">2</a>
	Existence, an absolute Consciousness, an illimitable Beatitude.
	To others it is the one Divine beyond all Divinities, an ineffable Person of whom all these three supreme things are
	the attributes.
	And so through an endless chapter.
	As is the power of our spirit and the cast of our nature, so we conceive of the one Eternal and Infinite.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 364</p>
<p class="P">
	This Eternal and Infinite, however we conceive it, is the one ultimate aim of Yoga.
	Other smaller aims there are that can be achieved by it and are pursued by many seekers; but these are crowns of the
	wayside or even flowers of the bye-paths and their pursuit for their own sake may lead us far aside or far away from
	our eternal home.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The object of supramental Yoga combines all the others, but uplifts and transforms the smaller aims into a part of
	the completeness of the one supreme object.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Not to lose oneself altogether in some ineffable featurelessness is its object, but to renounce ego for our true
	divine person one with the universal and infinite; not to abolish consciousness, but to exchange ignorance for a
	supreme and all-containing Knowledge, not to blot out joy but to renounce human pleasure for a divine griefless
	beatitude, not to give up but to transform all world-nature and world-existence into a power of the Truth of the
	Divine Existence.
	Asceticism is not the final condition or characteristic means of this Yoga, although it does not exclude, whenever
	that is needful ascetic self-mastery or ascetic endeavour.
</p>
<p class="P">
	To become one in our absolute being with the ineffable Divine and in the manifestation a free movement of his being,
	power, consciousness and self-realising joy, to grow into a divine Truth-consciousness beyond mind, into a Light
	beyond all human or earthly lights, into a Power to which the greatest strengths of men are a weakness, into the
	wisdom of an infallible gnosis and the mastery of an unerring and unfailing divinity of Will, into a Bliss beside
	which all human pleasure is as the broken reflection of a candle-flame to the all-pervading splendour of an
	imperishable sun, but all this not for our own sake [but] for the pleasure of the Divine Beloved, this is the goal
	and the crown of the supramental path of Yoga.
</p>
<p class="P">
	This change is a thing in Nature and not out of Nature; it is not only possible, but for the growing soul
	inevitable.
	It is the goal to which Nature in us walks through all this appearance of ignorance, error, suffering and weakness.

</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 365</p>
<p class="P">
	The ascent demands a one-centred all-gathering aspiration of soul and mind and life and body upward, the descent a

	If this call and this aspiration are there and if they grow constantly and seize all the nature, then and then only

	There must be too an increasing capacity to bear an ever stronger and more insistent action of the divine Force,
	till the soul has become a child in the hands of the infinite Mother.
	All other means known to other Yoga can be used and are from time to time used as subordinate processes in this Yoga

<p class="P">
	In the end it will be found that this Yoga cannot be carried through to its end by any effort of mind, life and
	body, any human psychological or physical process but only by the action of the supreme Shakti.
	But her way is at once too mysteriously direct and outwardly intricate, too great, too complete and subtle to be
	comprehensively followed, much more to be cut out and defined into a formula by our human intelligence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Man cannot by his own effort make himself more than man, but he can call down the divine Truth and its power to work
	in him.
	A descent of the Divine Nature can alone divinise the human receptacle.

	This divinisation of the nature of which we speak is a metamorphosis, not a mere growth into some kind of
	superhumanity, but a change from the falsehood of our ignorant nature into the truth of God-nature.
	The mental or vital demigod, the Asura, Rakshasa and Pishacha, — Titan, vital giant and demon, — are superhuman in
	the pitch and force and movement and in the make of their characteristic nature, but these are not divine and those
	not supremely divine, for they live in a greater mind power or life power only, but they do not live in the supreme
	Truth, and only the supreme Truth is divine.
	Only those who live in a supreme Truth consciousness and embody it are inwardly made or else remade in the Divine
	image.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The aim of supramental Yoga is to change into this supreme Truth-consciousness, but this truth is something beyond
	mind and this consciousness is far above the highest mind-consciousness.
	For truth of mind is always relative, uncertain and partial, but this greater Truth is peremptory and whole.
	Truth of mind is a representation, always an inadequate, most often a misleading representation, and even when most
	accurate, only a reflection, Truth's shadow and not its body.
	Mind does not live in the Truth or possess but only seeks after it and grasps at best some threads from its robe;
	the supermind lives in Truth and [is] its native substance, form and expression; it has not to seek after it, but
	possesses it always automatically and is what it possesses.
	This is the very heart of the difference.
</p>
<p class="P">
	The change that is effected by the transition from mind to supermind is not only a revolution in knowledge or in our
	power for knowledge.
	If it is [to] be complete and stable, it must be a divine transmutation of our will too, our emotions, our
	sensations, all our power of life and its forces, in the end even of the very substance and functioning of our body.
	Then only can it be said that the supermind is there upon earth, rooted in its very earth-substance and embodied in
	a new race of divinised creatures.

	vagueness and much misprision of the true nature of this soul and it is given a wide extension of meaning which
	carries it far beyond that province.
	All phenomena of an abnormal or supernormal psychological or an occult character are dubbed psychic; if a man has a
	double personality changing from one to another, if an apparition of a dying man, something of his mere vital sheath
	or else a thought-form of him, appears and stalks through the room of his wondering friend, if a poltergeist kicks
	up an unseemly row in a house, all that is classed under psychic phenomena and regarded as a fit object for psychic
	research, though these things have nothing whatever to do with the psyche.
	Again much in Yoga itself that is merely occult, phenomena of the unseen vital or mental or subtle physical planes,
	visions, symbols, all that mixed, often perturbed, often shadowy, often illusory range of experiences which belong
	to this intervening country between the soul and its superficial instruments or rather to its outermost fringes, all
	the chaos of the intermediate zone, is summed up as psychic and considered as an inferior and dubious province of
	spiritual discovery.
	Again there is a constant confusion between the mentalised desire-soul which is a creation of the vital urge in man,
	of his life-force seeking for its fulfilment and the true soul which is a spark of the Divine Fire, a portion of the
	Divine.
	Because the soul, the psychic being uses the mind and the vital as well as the body as instruments for growth and
	experience it is itself looked at as if it were some amalgam or some subtle substratum of mind and life.
	But in Yoga if we accept all this chaotic mass as soul-stuff or soul-movement we shall enter into a confusion
	without an issue.
	All that belongs only to the coverings of the soul; the soul itself is an inner divinity greater than mind or life
	or body.
	It is something that once it is released from obscuration by its instruments at once creates a direct contact with
	the Divine and with the self and spirit.

	Yoga is not only a discovery of our concealed spiritual status but a dynamic spiritual self-creation; a triple
	transformation is the heart of its process and the revelation of its entire significance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Its first step is the unveiling of the soul;<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="124" href="#">1</a> for there [is a] secret
	psychic being, a divine element in our depths that is concealed even more than garbed by the mind, body and life.
	To bring it out of its seclusion where it lives like a spiritual king without apparent power served and replaced by
	its ministers, so that it may take over the whole active government of the nature is the first great unfolding, the
	initial potent self-discovery of the Yoga.
	Mind the thinker is the prime minister in us who covers the king, but mind too is dominated and led by the vital
	powers, the strong and violent of the realm, who force it to serve their purpose and these too can only act with the
	means given them by the body and physical nature, the inert hardly conscious subject existence whose passive assent
	and docile instrumentation is yet indispensable to its rulers.
	This is our present constitution and it amounts to no more than a sort of organised confusion, a feudal order that
	is an ignorant half anarchy and cannot make the most of the possibilities and resources even of the limited tract of
	nature which we inhabit, much less reveal to us and exploit our spiritual empire.
	To reinstate the king-soul is the first step in a needed revolution — the soul directing the mind will exercise
	through it its sovereign power over the powers of life and subject to them in their turn an enlightened and
	psychically consenting body.
	But this is not all; for soul-discovery is not complete without a psychic new creation of the mental, vital and
	physical instrumentation of nature.
	The mind will be recast by the soul's intuition of Truth, the vital being by its perception of power and good, the
	body and whole nature by its command for light, harmony and beauty.
	Our nature will become that of a true psychic entity, not a brute creation unified by a precarious life and
	illumined by the candlelight of a struggling intelligence.

	external movements.
	It is neither an ethical change nor a religious conversion, neither sainthood nor ascetic control, neither a

	a coercive control or rejection of the physical existence.
	What is envisaged is a change from a lesser to a greater, from a lower to a higher, from a surface to a deeper
	consciousness — indeed to the largest, highest, deepest possible and a total change and revolution of the whole
	being in its stuff and mass and every detail into that yet unrealised diviner nature of existence.
	It means a bringing forward of what is now hidden and subliminal, a growing conscious in what is now superconscient
	to us, an illumination of the subconscient and subphysical.
	It implies a substitution of the control of the nature by the soul for its present control by the mind; a
	transference of the instrumentation of the nature from the outer to the now more than half-veiled inner mind, from
	the outer to the inner vital or life-self, from the outer to an inner subtler vaster physical consciousness and by
	this transference a direct and conscious instead of an indirect and unconscious or half conscious contact with the

	A Theory of the Human Being
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 381</p>
<p class="P">
	It is a superstition of modern thought that the march of knowledge has in all its parts progressed always in
	a line of forward progress deviating from it, no doubt, in certain periods of obscuration, but always returning and
	in the sum constituting everywhere an advance and nowhere a retrogression.
	Like all superstitions this belief is founded on bad and imperfect observation flowering into a logical fallacy.
	Our observation is necessarily imperfect because we have at our disposal the historical data and literary records of
	only a few millenniums and beyond only disjected and insufficient indices which leave gigantic room for the
	hardly-fettered activity of the mind's two chief helpers and misleaders, inference and conjecture.
	Our observation is bad because, prepossessed by the fixed idea of a brief and recent emergence from immemorial
	barbarism, imagining Plato to have blossomed in a few centuries out of a stock only a little more advanced than the
	South Sea islander, we refuse to seek in the records that still remain of a lost superior knowledge their natural
	and coherent significance; we twist them rather into the image of our own thoughts or confine them within the still
	narrow limits of what we ourselves know and understand.
	The logical fallacy we land in as the goal of our bad observation is the erroneous conception that because we are
	more advanced than certain ancient peoples in our own especial lines of success, as the physical sciences, therefore
	necessarily we are also more advanced in other lines where we are still infants and have only recently begun to
	observe and experiment, as the science of psychology and the knowledge of our subjective existence and of mental
	forces.
	Hence we have developed the exact contrary of the old superstition that the movement of man is always backward to
	retrogression.
	While our forefathers believed that the more ancient might on the whole be trusted as more authoritative, because
	nearer to the gods, and the less ancient less authoritative because nearer to man's ultimate degeneracy, we believe
	on the contrary that the more ancient is always on the whole more untrue because nearer to the unlettered and
	unenquiring savage, the more modern the more true because held as opinion by the lettered and instructed citizen of
	Paris or Berlin.
	Neither position can be accepted.
	Verification by experience and experiment is the only standard of truth, not antiquity, not modernity.
	Some of the ideas of the ancients or even of the savage now scouted by us may be lost truths or statements of valid
	experience from which we have turned or become oblivious; many of the notions of the modern schoolmen will certainly
	in the future be scouted as erroneous and superstitious.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Among the ancient documents held by the ancients to be deep mines of profound and fertile truth but to us forgetful
	and blind of their meaning the Veda and Upanishads rank among the very highest.

	A Cyclical Theory of Evolution
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 383</p>
<p class="P">
	[.....] Driven from all other fields by a perception of the slow and aeonic processes of Nature, the mushroom theory
	of existence took refuge in this ill-explored corner of scientific theory.
	Thence, although later discoveries have had an enlarging effect, it still hampers the growth of more thoughtful
	generalisations.
	The time-limit allowed for the growth of civilisation is still impossibly<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="128" href="#">1</a> short and in consequence an air of unreality hangs over the application of the evolutionary idea
	to our human development.
	Nor is this essential objection cured by any evidence of the modernity of human civilisation.
	Its great antiquity is denied merely on the absence [of] affirmative data; there are no positive indications to
	support the denial; but where data are scanty, such a negative basis is in the last degree unsound and precarious.
	We can no longer argue that no ancient civilisations can have existed of which the traces have entirely perished and
	that prehistoric means, necessarily, savage and undeveloped.
	History on the contrary abounds with instances of great societies which were within an ace of disappearing without
	leaving any visible memorial behind them and recent excavations have shown that such disappearances in ancient times
	have been even not uncommon.
	We cannot have exhausted all that the earth contains.
	There should be the remains of other civilisations yet undiscovered and there may well have been yet others which
	because of the manner of their disappearance or for other causes have left no traces at all whether upon the surface
	of the earth or under it.
	Indeed with regard to no object or previous existence, no silent or imperfectly documented [?scene], is it safe to
	argue that because there are no traces or sufficient evidence of it, therefore it never existed.
	Yet in many fields of generalisation modern scholarship has used substantially this argument with a prodigal
	freedom.
	It is at least possible that mighty cities and noble civilisations filled with their rumour the now silent spaces of
	Time for countless millenniums before Egypt and Assyria rose into their historic greatness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	Brief lapse of time is not indeed the cardinal point of the savage theory and even if larger time-spaces are
	allowed, the theory itself need not fall.
	But I have urged the question of time as of primary moment not for the overthrow of the modern explanation but for
	the readmission of another and more ancient synthesis.
	For if once we allow the existence of prehistoric civilisations older, it would seem, than the Egyptian, — such as
	may be argued from the deep-buried cities of Asia, — and the presence in an unknown antiquity of great national
	cultures where now the savage or the semi-savage swarm uncreative and unreflecting, — such as may be argued from the
	ruins of Mashonaland or the state of mediaeval Barbary after the ravages of Moor and Vandal or even the fate which
	overtook for almost a millennium the magnificent structure of Graeco-Roman culture and threatened even to blot out
	its remnants and ruins, — the question then arises, what was the nature of these forgotten civilisations and how was
	the relapse to barbarism often of an extreme form, so completely effected.
	These gigantic spaces of time, this worldwide rise and fall of human society, this swaying to and fro from darkness
	to light and light to darkness leave the ground open for another explanation which is in some respects the reverse
	of the savage theory, — for the Hindu explanation.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 384</p>
<p class="P">
	For the Hindu mind has never admitted the principle in Nature of progress in a straight line.
	Progress in a straight line only appears to occur and so appears only because we concentrate our scrutiny on limited
	sections of the curve that Nature is following.
	But if we stand away from this too near and detailed scrutiny and look at the world in its large masses, we perceive
	that its journeying forward has no straightness in it of any kind but is rather effected in a series of cycles of
	which the net result is progress.
	The image of this apparent straight line is that of the ship which seems to its crew to be journeying on the even
	plain of the waters but is really describing the curve of the earth in a way perceptible only to a more distant and
	instructed vision.
	Moreover even the small section of the curve which we are examining and which to our limited vision seems to be a
	straight line is the result of a series of zigzags and is caused by the conflict of forces arriving by a continual
	struggle at a continual compromise or working out by their prolonged discord a temporary harmony.
	The image of the actual progress in cycles is the voyaging in Space of the planets which describe always the same
	curve round their flaming and luminous sun, image of the perfect strength, joy, beauty, beneficence and knowledge
	towards which our evolution yearns.
	The cycle is always the same ellipse, yet by the simultaneous movement of the whole system the completed round finds
	the planet at a more advanced station in Space than its preceding journey.
	It is in this way, by an ever-swaying battle, a prodigal destruction and construction, a labouring forward in
	ever-progressing curves and ellipses that Nature advances to her secret consummation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	These are the conceptions we find expressed in the Puranic symbols familiar to our imagination.
	There is the Kalpa of a thousand ages with its term of fourteen Manwantaras dividing a sub-cycle of a hundred
	chaturyugas; there is the dharma, the well-harmonised law of being, perfect in the golden period of the Satya,
	impaired progressively in bronze Treta and copper Dwapara, collapsing in the iron Kali only to open the way by its
	disintegration to the manifestation in the next Satya of the old law, truth or natural principle of existence
	arranged in a new harmony.
	There is throughout this zigzag, this rhythm of rise and fall and rise again brought about by the struggle of
	upward, downward and stationary forces.
	There are the alternate triumphs of deva and daitya, helping god and opposing or too violently forward-striving
	Titan; — the dharmasya glani and abhyutthanam adharmasya, when harmony is denied and discord or wrong harmony
	established, and then the Avatara and the dharmasya sansthapanam, eternal Light and Force descending, restoring,
	effecting a new temporary adjustment of the world's ways to the truth of things and of man.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 385</p>
<p class="P">
	Translated into more modern but not necessarily more accurate language these symbols point us to a world history not
	full of the continual, ideal, straightforward victory of good and truth, not progress conceived as the Europeans
	conceive it, a continual joyous gallop through new and ever new changes to an increasing perfection, but rather of
	the alternately triumphant forces of progress and regression, a toiling forward and a sliding backward, — the
	continual revolution of human nature upon itself which yet undoubtedly has but conceals and seems not to have its
	secret of definite aim and ultimate exultant victory.
	In certain respects the old Vedantic thinkers anticipate us; they agree with all that is essential in our modern
	ideas of evolution.
	From one side all forms of creatures are developed; some kind of physical evolution from the animal to the human
	body is admitted in the Aitareya.
	The Taittiriya suggests the psychological progress of man, and the psychological progress of race cannot be
	different in principle from the evolution of the individual — a proceeding from the material, the emotionally and
	mentally inert man upwards [?through] the mental to [?our] spiritual fulfilment.
	The Puranas admit the creation of animal forms before the appearance of man and in the symbol of the Ten Avatars
	trace<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="129" href="#">2</a> the growth of our evolution from the fish through the animal,
	the man-animal and the developed human being to the different stages of our present incomplete evolution.
	But the ancient Hindu, it is clear, envisaged this progression as an enormous secular movement covering more ages
	than we can easily count.
	He believed that Nature has repeated it over and over again, as indeed it is probable that she has done, resuming
	briefly and in sum at each start what she had previously accomplished in detail, slowly and with labour.
	It is this great secular movement in cycles, perpetually self-repeating, yet perpetually progressing, which is
	imaged and set forth for us in the symbols of the Puranas.
	It is for this reason that he assigned to his civilisation those immense eras and those ancient and far backward
	beginnings which strike the modern as so incredible.
	He may have erred; recent discoveries and indications are increasingly tending to convince us that nineteenth
	century scholarship has erred equally in the opposite direction.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 386</p>
<p class="P">
	Translated again into modern language the Hindu idea of the chaturyuga, four Ages, with all the attendant Puranic
	circumstances persists as the tradition of a period just such as has been postulated, a period of natural and
	perfect poise in his knowledge, action and temper between man and his environment.
	The ideas, the knowledge, the temper, the spirit of this great epoch of civilisation, — but not its institutions or
	practices — is preserved for us in the Veda and Vedanta, and all existing human societies, civilised or barbarous,

	A Misunderstanding of Continents
</h1>
<p class="P">
	T<b>he</b> peculiar and striking opposition of thought, temperament, culture and manners between Asia and Europe has
	been a commonplace of observation and criticism since the times when Herodotus noted in his history the objection of
	both men and women to be seen naked as a curious and amusing trait of Asiatic barbarism.
	Much water has flown under the bridges since Herodotus wrote and in this respect Asia seems not only to have
	infected Europe with this “barbaric” trait of manners, but to have been far outstripped by her pupil in the
	development of sartorial superfluities.
	Excessive wealth and gorgeous splendour was also quoted as a characteristic of Asiatic barbarism from the time of
	the classical poets.
	Europe has seen to it that this charge shall only apply now in a very minimum quantity to the eastern continent.
	Asia now stands, not only by choice of her ascetics, but by economic compulsion for the simple life, and the
	ostentation of wealth which was once depreciated as a sign of oriental barbarism now parades itself, much
	vulgarised, at least to our barbaric eastern notion of aesthetics as the splendid face of occidental civilisation.
	But if circumstances have changed, the essential opposition abides; East is still East in its soul and West is still
	West and the misunderstanding of continents still flourishes, not only in the minds of politicians and “statesmen”,
	— where one would naturally expect to find it, since it is there that vulgar prejudices, half-truths, whole untruths
	and unintelligent commonplaces assume their most solemn and sententious form, coin themselves into glittering
	phrases or flow in rhetorical periods, — but in the minds too of critics, poets and leading intellectuals.
	Faced with this continued misunderstanding, one is obliged to ask whether it is really incurable, an antinomy on
	which Nature is resolved to insist until the end of this cycle.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 390</p>
<p class="P">
	Some of us, temerarious idealists, have thought that the misconception, the want of understanding is not only
	curable, but that to cure it as soon as may be is essential to the future interests of humanity.
	For my part I hold that all antinomies and opposed powers in this world of contradictions would be much better for
	an attempt to understand each other's souls and find their meeting point, would find something helpful not only to
	tone down their own exaggerations, but to fill in and round themselves without losing what is essential to their own
	spirit.
	Recently there has been a distinct widening in many minds, a nearer approach to understanding, almost to fusion.
	A little while ago in the first lyrical enthusiasm of the war and its “sacred unions” one imagined that a decisive
	step had been taken and the peoples themselves would now be ready for sympathy and understanding.
	But it seems it is not quite so yet[.]

	Towards Unification
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 393392</p>
<p class="P">
	T<b>he</b> progress of distance-bridging inventions, our modern facility for the multiplication of books and their
	copies and the increase of human curiosity are rapidly converting humanity into a single intellectual unit with a
	common fund of knowledge and ideas and a unified culture.
	The process is far from complete, but the broad lines of the plan laid down by the great Artificer of things already
	begin to appear.
	For a time this unification was applied to Europe only.
	Asia had its own triune civilisation, predominatingly spiritual, complex and meditative in India, predominatingly
	vital, emotional, active and simplistic in the regions of the Hindu Kush and Mesopotamia, predominatingly
	intellectual, mechanical and organised in the Mongolian empires.
	East, West and South had their widely separate spirit and traditions, but one basis of spirituality, common
	tendencies and such commerce of art, ideas and information as the difficulties of communication allowed, preserved
	the fundamental unity of Asia.
	East and West only met at their portals, in war oftener than in peace and through that shock and contact influenced
	but did not mingle with each other.
	It was the discovery of Indian philosophy and poetry which broke down the barrier.
	For the first time Europe discovered something in the East which she could study not only with the curiosity which
	she gave to Semitic and Mongolian ideas and origins, but with sympathy and even with some feeling of identity.
	This metaphysics, these epics and dramas, this formulated jurisprudence and complex society had methods and a form
	which, in spite of their diversity from her own, yet presented strong points of contact; she could recognise them,
	to a certain extent she thought she could understand.
	The speculativeness of the German, the lucidity of the Gaul, the imagination and aesthetic emotionalism of the
	British Celt found something to interest them, something even to assist.
	In the teachings of Buddha, the speculation of Shankara, the poetry of Kalidasa their souls could find pasture and
	refreshment.
	The alien form and spirit of Japanese and Arabian poetry and of Chinese philosophy which prevented such an
	approximation with the rest of Asia, was not here to interfere with the comprehension of the human soul and
	substance.
	There was indeed a single exception which remarkably illustrates the difficulty of which I speak.
	The art of India contradicted European notions too vitally to be admitted into the European consciousness; its charm
	and power were concealed by the uncouthness to Western eyes of its form and the strangeness of its motives and it is
	only now, after the greatest of living art-critics in England had published sympathetic appreciations of Indian art
	and energetic propagandists like Mr.
	Havell had persevered in their labour, that the European vision is opening to the secret of Indian painting and
	sculpture.
	But the art of Japan presented certain outward characteristics on which the European could readily seize.
	Japanese painting had already begun to make its way into Europe even before the victories of Japan and its
	acceptance of much of the outward circumstances of European civilisation opened a broad door into Europe for all in
	Japan that Europe can receive without unease or the feeling of an incompatible strangeness.
	Japanese painting, Japanese dress, Japanese decoration are not only accepted as a part of Western life by the select
	few and the cultured classes but known and allowed, without being adopted, by the millions.
	Asiatic civilisation has entered into Europe as definitely though not so victoriously as European civilisation into
	Asia.
	It is only the beginning, but so was it only the beginning when a few scholars alone rejoiced in the clarity of
	Buddhistic Nihilism, Schopenhauer rested his soul on the Upanishads and Emerson steeped himself in the Gita.
	No one could have imagined then that a Hindu monk would make converts in London and Chicago or that a Vedantic
	temple would be built in San Francisco and Anglo-Saxon Islamites erect a Musulman mosque in Liverpool.
	It appears from a recent inquiry that the only reading, omitting works of fiction, which commands<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130" href="#">1</a> wide and general interest among public library readers is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="131" href="#">2</a> either scientific works or books replete with Asiatic mysticism.
	How significant is this fact when we remember that these are the two powers, Europe and Asia, the victorious
	intellect and the insurgent spirit, which are rising at this moment to do battle for the mastery of the unified
	world.
	Nevertheless it is not the public library reader, that man in the street of the literary world, but the increasing
	circle of men of culture and a various curiosity through whom the Orient and the Occident must first meet in a
	common humanity and the day dawn when some knowledge of the substance of [the] Upanishads will be as necessary to an
	universal culture as a knowledge of the substance of the Bible, Shankara's theories as familiar as the speculations
	of Teutonic thinkers and Kalidasa, Valmekie and Vyasa as near and common to the subject matter of the European
	critical intellect as Dante or Homer.

	I<b>t is</b> significant of the tendencies of the twentieth century that all its great and typical events should
	have occurred no longer as in the last few centuries in Europe, but in Asia.
	The Russo-Japanese war, the Chinese Revolution, the constitutional changes in Turkey and Persia and last but most
	momentous the revival however indeterminate as yet of the soul of India, are the really significant events of the
	young century.
	In Europe except in its one Asiatic corner there has been no event of corresponding magnitude and importance.
	The abortive orgy of revolutionary fury in Russia, the growth of enormous strikes, the failure of the peace
	movement, the increase of legislation stamped with the pressure of a materialistic Socialism, although they may hold
	in themselves germs of greater things, are so far mere indistinct material symptoms of disorganisation and a disease
	vainly doctored with palliatives, not events of a definite movement of new birth and regeneration.
	The importance of this new tendency lies in the fact that great events in Europe, even when they are outwardly
	spiritual, have usually an intellectual or social trend and significance, but great events in Asia have even when
	they are outwardly intellectual, social or political a spiritual significance.
	Therefore when Asia once more becomes the theatre of the world's chief events, it is a sure sign that some great
	spiritual revolution, perhaps a great age of spirituality is preparing for humanity.

	Renascent India
</h1>
<p class="P">
	Everybody can feel, even without any need of a special sense for the hidden forces and tendencies concealed
	in the apparent march of things, for the signs are already apparent, that India is on the verge, in some directions
	already in the first movements of a great renascence, more momentous, more instinct with great changes and results,
	than anything that has gone before it.
	Every new awakening of the kind comes by some impact slight or great on the national consciousness which puts it in
	face of new ideas, new conditions, new needs, the necessity of readaptation to a changing environment.
	The spirit of the nation has to take account of its powers and possibilities and is stirred by a will to new
	formation and new creation.
	The change does not always amount to a renascence.
	But the impact in which we live at the present hour is nothing less than that of a new world.
	It is not merely the pressure of the whole Western civilisation upon the ancient spirit of the East or of modernism
	on a great traditional civilisation, but it is a great worldwide change, an approaching new birth of mankind itself
	of which the change in us is only a part.
	Therefore the result that we are face to face with, is a renascence, the birth of the Spirit into a new body, new
	forms in society and politics, new forms of literature, art, science, philosophy, action and creation of all kinds.
	And the question arises what in the great play of modification and interchange around us are we going to take from
	the world around us, how are we going to shape [it] in the stress of our own spirit and past traditions, and what
	are we going to bring out of ourselves and impress upon the world in exchange?
	In what new forms is the spirit of India going to embody itself and what relations will its new creations have with
	the future of the world?

	Where We Stand in Literature
</h1>
<h2 class="Cp-Nm" id="">[Draft A]</h2>
<p class="P">
	Where we stand, not only in literature, but in all things, is at or near a great turning point in which the thoughts
	and forms of East and West, both in an immense ferment of change, are working upon each other to produce something
	great, unforeseeable and unprecedented.
	From the less worldwide viewpoint which most nearly concerns us in this country, we may say, that we find ourselves
	in a great hour of rebirth of the ancient soul of India.
	The momentous issues of this hour are producing their inevitable upheaval, change and effort at creation in the
	whole national life, politics, society, economical conditions, industry, commerce, as well as and more noisily than
	in literature.
	But it is perhaps in art, literature and science that the future will see what was most definitive in the creations
	of the present hour, the most significant thing in the Indian renascence; for these things reveal most freely the
	spirit which is coming to birth; they have found their field, discovered their motive; the rest is still only a
	primary effort to escape out of unnatural conditions; the field has there yet to be made clear, before the
	struggling spiritual motive can make itself dominant and create its appropriate forms.
	Especially, is the movement of literature most revelatory; for while music and art reveal perhaps more absolutely
	the soul of a nation, literature is the whole expression of its mind and psychology, — not only of what it is in
	action, or what it is in essence, but its thought, character and aspiration.
</p>
<h2 class="Cp-Nm" id="">[Draft B]</h2>
<p class="pg-num">Page 399</p>
<p class="P">
	In literature, as in all else, we stand in India at the opening of a new age, in an hour of national rebirth and in
	the midst of a number of tendencies, possibilities, movements of which only a few have as yet formed for themselves
	distinct shapes, plainly decipherable signs.
	It is an hour not yet of accomplishment, but of travail and inception.
	What will be born of this dim travail, these shapeless or half-shaped beginnings, is no doubt already decided in the
	secret spirit of the age and in the subconscient mind of the people.
	Behind the waverings and strivings of our twilit surface minds the soul of India knows no doubt what it intends and
	is moving us to great fulfilments.
	But it is well also for us to ponder and inquire what it is the national soul and the soul of humanity demand from
	us and on what paths we are most likely to give our energies and efforts the maximum power and serviceableness to
	the great age of mankind and of India on which we are entering.
	For at such a moment there are usually many false starts and many misdirected aims and by seeing our way and our
	goal more clearly we may better be able to avoid the waste of energy, talent and even genius to which they give
	rise.

	National Education<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="132" href="#">1</a></h1>
<p class="P">
	The whole movement of the national life of India at the present moment may be described in one phrase, — a
	pressure from within towards self-liberation from all unnatural conditions which obstruct or divert its free and
	spontaneous development.
	It is the movement of a stream trying to break open a natural path for its dammed-up waters.
	This effort takes inevitably many sides and aspects; for in politics and administration, in society, in commerce, in
	education, this national life finds itself bound up in forms, condemned to move in grooves which give no natural
	play to the new aspirations, powers and tendencies which have become its inner impelling motives.
	The effort to discover and organise a system of national education is part of this general effort of
	self-liberation, of self-finding, but perhaps the most central movement of all, in the end even the most important;
	for it is this which will give shape to the spirit of the nation at present in a state of rather formless flux.
	It is in fact no more than a chaotic press of tendencies; a national culture alone can give it form and consistency;
	and national education is the attempt to create and organise that culture.

	When the human being puts forth a force in himself which is considerable but acts normally, we call it
	talent; when it is abnormal in its working we call it genius.
	It would seem, therefore, that genius is in reality some imperfect step in evolution by which mankind in its most
	vigorous and forward individuals is attempting to develop a faculty which the race as a whole is not strong enough
	as yet to command or to acclimatise.
	As always happens in such a movement, there is a considerable irregularity in the working of the new phenomenon.

	Poetic Genius</h1>
<p class="P">The greatest poets are usually those who arise either out of a large simple and puissant
	environment or out of a movement of mind that is grandiose, forceful and elemental.
	When man becomes excessively<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="133" href="#">1</a> refined in intellect, curious
	in aesthetic sensibility or minute and exact in intellectual reasoning, it becomes more and more difficult to write
	great and powerful poetry.
	Ages of accomplished intellectuality and scholarship or of strong scientific rationality are not
	favourable to the birth of great poets or, if they are born, not favourable to the free and untrammelled action of
	their gifts.
	They remain great, but their greatness bends under a load; there is a lack of triumphant spontaneity and
	they do not draw as freely or directly from the sources of human action and character.
	An untameable elemental force is needed to overcome more than partially the denials of the
	environment.
	For poetry, even though it appeals in passing to the intellect and aesthetic sense, does not proceed from
	them but is in its nature an elemental power proceeding from the secret and elemental Power within which sees
	directly and creates sovereignly, and it passes at once to our vital and elemental parts.
	Intellect and the aesthetic faculties are necessary to the perfection of our critical enjoyment; but they
	were<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="134" href="#">2</a> only assistants, not the direct agents<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="135" href="#">3</a> of this divine birth.

	The Voices of the Poets
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 406</p>
<p class="P">Out of the infinite silence of the past, peopled only to the eye of history or the ear of
	the Yogin, a few voices arise which speak for it, express it and are the very utterance and soul of those unknown
	generations, of that vanished and now silent humanity.
	These are the voices of the poets.
	We whose souls are drying up in this hard and parched age of utilitarian and scientific thought when men
	value little beyond what gives them exact and useful knowledge or leads them to some outward increase of power and
	pleasure, we who are beginning to neglect and ignore poetry and can no longer write it greatly and well, — just as
	we have forgotten how to sculpture like the Greeks, paint like the mediaeval Italians or build like the Buddhists, —
	are apt to forget this grand utility of the poets, one noble faculty among their many divine and unusual
	powers.
	The kavi or vates, poet and seer, is not the manishi; he is not [the] logical thinker, scientific
	analyser or metaphysical reasoner; his knowledge is one not with his thought, but with his being; he has not arrived
	at it but has it in himself by virtue of his power to become one with all that is around him.
	By some form of spiritual, vital and emotional oneness, he is what he sees; he is the hero thundering in
	the forefront of the battle, the mother weeping over her dead, the tree trembling violently in the storm, the flower
	warmly penetrated with the sunshine.
	And because he is these things, therefore he knows them; because he knows thus, spiritually and not
	rationally, he can write of them.
	He feels their delight and pain, he shares their virtue and sin, he enjoys their reward or bears their
	punishment.
	It is for this reason that poetry written out of the intellect is so inferior to poetry written out of
	the soul, is, — even as poetical thinking, — so inferior to the thought that comes formed by inscrutable means out
	of the soul.
	For this reason, too, poets of otherwise great faculty, have failed to give us living men and women or
	really to show to our inner vision even the things of which they write eloquently or sweetly, because they are
	content to write about them after having seen them with the mind only, and have not been able or have not taken care
	first to be the things of which they would write and then not so much write about them as let them pour themselves
	out<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="136" href="#">1</a> in speech that is an image of the soul.
	They have been too easily attracted by the materials of poetry, artha and shabda; drawn by some power and
	charm in the substance of speech, captivated by some melody, harmony or colour in the form of speech, arrested by
	some strong personal emotion which clutches at expression<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="137" href="#">2</a> or gropes
	for expression in these externals of poetry they have forgotten to bathe in the Muse’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="138" href="#">3</a> deepest springs.
</p>
<p class="P">Therefore among those ancient voices, even when the literature of the ages has been winnowed and
	chosen by Time, there are very few who recreate for us in poetic speech deeply and mightily the dead past, because
	they were that past, not so much themselves as the age and nation in which they lived and not so much even the age
	and nation as that universal humanity which in spite of all differences, under them and within them, even expressing
	its unity through them is the same in every nation and in every age.
	Others give us only fragments of thought or outbursts of feeling or reveal to us scattered incidents of
	sight, sound and outward happening.
	These are complete, vast, multitudinous, infinite in a way, impersonal and many-personed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="139" href="#">4</a> in their very personality, not divine workmen merely but true<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="140" href="#">5</a> creators endowed by God with something of His divine power and offering therefore
	in their works some image of His creative activity.

<p class="P">
	God God has a personality but no character; He is as we say in our Eastern thought, Anantaguna, of an
	infinite variation of qualities without fixed limitation or rigid distinction and incompatibility.
	His superhuman cruelty melts into and harmonises with His ineffable pity; His fierce enmity is one mask of His
	intensest love.
	For, being alone existent, He is irresponsible and the harmonies He creates, are the figment of His own plastic will
	and governed by laws of aesthetics determined in His own unfettered but infallible fantasy.
	Out of His infinite personality He creates all these characters and their inevitable actions and destinies.
	So it is with every divine creator, – with Homer, Shakespeare, Valmiki, Kalidasa.
	It is perfectly true that each has his own style of language and creation, his own preferred system or harmony of
	the poetic Art, just as the creator of this universe has fashioned it in a particular style and rhythm and on
	certain preferred and fixed canons, differing from that of the other universes He may have built in His infinite
	Being.
	But within that style and harmony they are not bound by any fixed personality.
	It is rather the infinite they express though through their personality, than their personality through their works.
	The writers who are limited by their personality may be among the fine artists of literature; they cannot be among
	the greatest creators; for to the creator freedom and infinity are necessary attributes.
	It is the infinite alone that can create; the finite can only manufacture, reproduce or at the most bring out a fine
	art and craftsmanship.
	Among all the Elizabethan dramatists Shakespeare alone has produced living men; the rest are only admirable, trivial
	or monstrous sketches, caricatures or images of men.
	There is, however, one exception to this rule; every man can at his best moments cast out, create in some way or
	another – for in our Indian languages the word for creating is casting out, letting free out of one's own being –
	one living creature and character, – himself.
	Milton has produced several bold and beautiful or fine outlines or descriptions, but only one living being, the
	rebel Archangel Satan, and only so in the first four books of Paradise Lost does Satan really live.
	When Milton ceases to portray himself in his fallen state and thinks only of his plot and subject, Satan also ceases
	to live.
	But the great impersonal creators even in their slightest creations, cannot help creating life.
	Impersonal, I say, but I do not mean by impersonality the nirguna, devoid or pure of quality, but rather the unfixed
	and unlimited by quality, – an infinite and indefinable personality out of which is not manufactured or cunningly
	shaped but perfectly and inevitably arises under the compelling eye of an intuitive Will to be this created world of
	innumerable brilliantly-coloured variously outlined individual existences.

	that had not lost the pulsations of our ancient immortality and were not yet attuned to the broken rhythms of pain
	and grief.
	The impression of such an atmosphere and background remains which the linking of ineffective details and the effort
	of words which are laden with the thoughts of an afflicted and oppressed humanity, strive vainly to restore.
	For those colours we have lost.
	When we speak of brightness, it is a subdued brilliance that is the utmost our imaginations can conceive; we mean
	only a broken hint of rapture when we talk even most eagerly of enjoyment and bliss.

	We live under the reign of Science, a reign which from the mouth of its hierophants claims to be a tyranny or

	It makes this claim by right of the great things it has done, of the immense utilities with which it has served,
	helped, strengthened, liberated, mankind, right knowledge of the world, an increasing and already fabulous mastery

	Reason and Society
</h1>
<p class="pg-num">Page 416</p>
<p class="P">
	A pragmatic mentalism would not be in its essential principle other than the attempt already made by the race
	to make the intellectual Reason the governor of life, but this has been done hitherto by a reason preoccupied with
	the external fact and subjected to it; mind has attempted to read the law of life and its possibilities and organise
	life anew within those limits by invention, device, regulation, mechanisms of many kinds, or it has attempted to
	govern life by mental ideals of an abstract order, such as democracy or socialism, and devise an appropriate
	machinery materialising that mental abstraction so as to make the dominance of the idea practical and viable.
	A subjectivist pragmatic mentalism would try to act more subtly and plastically on life; it would seek for “truth of
	being”, some idea or ideal of its perfection or practice or efficiency, right way of being or living, and attempt to
	let that grow in the individual and govern his nature, grow in the collective life and govern its formations.
	Or it would place the development and organisation of the mental life of man as the primary consideration and life
	and society as a convenience for this true aim of human existence.
	A new civilisation no longer vitalistic or mainly political and economic, but intellectual, cultural, idealistic,
	taking up the ancient ideal of man, the perfected mental being in an ennobled life and sound body, a great expansion
	of human mind and intellect, a mankind more mentally alive, even a human race grown capable of culture and not only
	of a greater external civilisation, thus fulfilling on a large human and universal scale the tendencies which in the
	past appeared only in a few favoured countries and epochs and even then imperfectly and mostly in a cultured class,
	might be the consequence of this change.
	That prospect has its attractions, and for the humanist and the intellectual it is in one form or another their
	Utopia of the future.
	But this would not really carry the human evolution farther; it would only give it for a time a larger, finer and
	freer movement in its widest attainable circle.
	If the mentality remained too pragmatic, too eager to rationalise or organise life according to the idea, the peril
	of mechanisation and standardisation would be there.
	If the mental ideas governing the individual and social life took a settled form, became a cultural system of the
	mind, this system would after a time exhaust its possibilities and human life would settle down into a groove,
	satisfied and non-evolutive, as happened in the Graeco-Roman world or in China or elsewhere where the mental
	intellect became the predominant power of life.
	If this arrest were avoided either by the multiplication of different cultures — different peoples acting upon each
	other but escaping the tendency to replication and standardisation which is the tendency of the human collective
	mind or by a free progressiveness of the human intelligence making constantly new ideas, new ideals, still the
	movement would eventually be in a circle or an ellipsis which could be a constant description of a new-old movement
	in the same field.
	In fact our external mind moving on the surface tends always to exhaust itself rapidly; if it expends itself slowly,
	conservatively, at a leisurely pace, it can create a civilisation and culture which will last for centuries or even
	for one or more thousands of years; but that too will exhaust itself in time; if it throws itself into a brilliant
	or rapid movement as in ancient Greece or in modern Europe a few centuries are likely to see the end of this flaming
	up as of a new star.
	Afterwards there must be stagnation, decline and a renewal of the mental circle.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 417</p>
<p class="P">
	This is because mind and thought are not the sovereign principle or highest term of our existence; mind and thought
	therefore can to a certain extent fulfil themselves, but they cannot fulfil life nor can they give to man his
	complete self.
	Mind is an instrument, not the self of man; nor the complete reality or highest reality of his being.
	It is a mediator between the being and life; it seeks to know truth of being and truth of life and bring them
	together.
	Truth of idea therefore is effective only so far as it can interpret truth of spirit and truth of life, it has
	itself no essential existence; when it erects itself as a mental abstraction, it has no reality and no effective
	power; it is only an index, a figure.
	It can become effective only by taking up life and catching hold of some vital force to effectuate it, but usually
	it ends by [...], exhausting or stereotyping and sterilising the force it uses; or it can become effective only when
	it canalises and brings out into action of mind and life an inner truth of being, a truth of spirit and it is then
	powerful only so long as it replenishes itself from its spiritual source and so keeps itself true and alive.

	Thoughts and Aphorisms</h1>
<blockquote><p class="P">
		Sri Aurobindo wrote the main series of 540 aphorisms around
 1913 in a single notebook under the headings “Jnana”,
 “Karma” and “Bhakti”. Seven additional aphorisms were not
 classified under these headings; the last five were written in a
 different notebook, probably somewhat later.	</p></blockquote>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="jnana">
	Jnana
</h1>
<p class="P">
	1. There are two allied powers in man; knowledge and wisdom.
	Knowledge is so much of the truth seen in a distorted medium as the mind arrives at by groping, wisdom what the eye
	of divine vision sees in the spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	2. Inspiration is a slender river of brightness leaping from a vast and eternal knowledge, it exceeds reason more
	perfectly than reason exceeds the knowledge of the senses.
</p>
<p class="P">
	3. When I speak, the reason says, “This will I say”; but God takes the word out of my mouth and the lips say
	something else at which reason trembles.
</p>
<p class="P">
	4. I am not a Jnani, for I have no knowledge except what God gives me for His work.
	How am I to know whether what I see be reason or folly?
	Nay, it is neither; for the thing seen is simply true and neither folly nor reason.
</p>
<p class="P">
	5. If mankind could but see though in a glimpse of fleeting experience what infinite enjoyments, what perfect
	forces, what luminous reaches of spontaneous knowledge, what wide calms of our being lie waiting for us in the
	tracts which our animal evolution has not yet conquered, they would leave all and never rest till they had gained
	these treasures.
	But the way is narrow, the doors are hard to force, and fear, distrust and scepticism are there, sentinels of
	Nature, to forbid the turning away of our feet from her ordinary pastures.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 424</p>
<p class="P">
	6. Late, I learned that when reason died, then Wisdom was born; before that liberation, I had only knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	7. What men call knowledge, is the reasoned acceptance of false appearances.
	Wisdom looks behind the veil and sees.
</p>
<p class="P">
	8. Reason divides, fixes details and contrasts them; Wisdom unifies, marries contrasts in a single harmony.
</p>
<p class="P">
	9. Either do not give the name of knowledge to your beliefs only and of error, ignorance or charlatanism to the
	beliefs of others, or do not rail at the dogmas of the sects and their intolerance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	10. What the soul sees and has experienced, that it knows; the rest is appearance, prejudice and opinion.
</p>
<p class="P">
	11. My soul knows that it is immortal.
	But you take a dead body to pieces and cry triumphantly “Where is your soul and where is your immortality?”
</p>
<p class="P">
	12. Immortality is not the survival of the mental personality after death, though that also is true, but the waking
	possession of the unborn and deathless self of which body is only an instrument and a shadow.
</p>
<p class="P">
	13. They proved to me by convincing reasons that God did not exist, and I believed them.
	Afterwards I saw God, for He came and embraced me.
	And now which am I to believe, the reasonings of others or my own experience?
</p>
<p class="P">
	14. They told me, “These things are hallucinations.”
	I inquired what was a hallucination and found that it meant a subjective or a psychical experience which corresponds
	to no objective or no physical reality.
	Then I sat and wondered at the miracles of the human reason.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 425</p>
<p class="P">
	15. Hallucination is the term of Science for those irregular glimpses we still have of truths shut out from us by
	our preoccupation with matter; coincidence for the curious touches of artistry in the work of that supreme and
	universal Intelligence which in its conscious being as on a canvas has planned and executed the world.
</p>
<p class="P">
	16. That which men term a hallucination is the reflection in the mind and senses of that which is beyond our
	ordinary mental and sensory perceptions.
	Superstition arises from the mind's wrong understanding of these reflections.
	There is no other hallucination.
</p>
<p class="P">
	17. Do not, like so many modern disputants, smother thought under polysyllables or charm inquiry to sleep by the
	spell of formulas and cant words.
	Search always; find out the reason for things which seem to the hasty glance to be mere chance or illusion.
</p>
<p class="P">
	18. Someone was laying it down that God must be this or that or He would not be God.
	But it seemed to me that I can only know what God is and I do not see how I can tell Him what He ought to be.
	For what is the standard by which we can judge Him?
	These judgments are the follies of our egoism.
</p>
<p class="P">
	19. Chance is not in this universe; the idea of illusion is itself an illusion.
	There was never illusion yet in the human mind that was not the concealing [?shape] and disfigurement of a truth.
</p>
<p class="P">
	20. When I had the dividing reason, I shrank from many things; after I had lost it in sight, I hunted through the
	world for the ugly and the repellent, but I could no longer find them.
</p>
<p class="P">
	21. God had opened my eyes; for I saw the nobility of the vulgar, the attractiveness of the repellent, the
	perfection of the maimed and the beauty of the hideous.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 426</p>
<p class="P">
	22. Forgiveness is praised by the Christian and the Vaishnava, but for me, I ask, “What have I to forgive and whom?”
</p>
<p class="P">
	23. God struck me with a human hand; shall I say then, “I pardon Thee thy insolence, O God”?
</p>
<p class="P">
	24. God gave me good in a blow.
	Shall I say, “I forgive thee, O Almighty One, the harm and the cruelty, but do it not again”?
</p>
<p class="P">
	25. When I pine at misfortune and call it evil, or am jealous and disappointed, then I know that there is awake in
	me again the eternal fool.
</p>
<p class="P">
	26. When I see others suffer, I feel that I am unfortunate, but the wisdom that is not mine, sees the good that is
	coming and approves.
</p>
<p class="P">
	27. Sir Philip Sidney said of the criminal led out to be hanged, “There, but for the grace of God, goes Sir Philip
	Sidney.”
	Wiser, had he said, “There, by the grace of God, goes Sir Philip Sidney.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	28. God is a great and cruel Torturer because He loves.
	You do not understand this, because you have not seen and played with Krishna.
</p>
<p class="P">
	29. One called Napoleon a tyrant and imperial cut-throat; but I saw God armed striding through Europe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	30. I have forgotten what vice is and what virtue; I can only see God, His play in the world and His will in
	humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	31. I saw a child wallowing in the dirt and the same child cleaned by his mother and resplendent, but each time I
	trembled before his utter purity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	32. What I wished or thought to be the right thing, does not come about; therefore it is clear that there is no All
	Wise one who guides the world but only blind Chance or a brute Causality.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 427</p>
<p class="P">
	33. The Atheist is God playing at hide and seek with Himself; but is the Theist any other?
	Well, perhaps; for he has seen the shadow of God and clutched at it.

<p class="P">
	34. O Thou that lovest, strike!
	If Thou strike me not now, I shall know that Thou lov'st<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="142" href="#">1</a> me not.

<p class="P">
	35. O Misfortune, blessed be thou; for through thee I have seen the face of my Lover.
</p>
<p class="P">
	36. Men are still in love with grief; when they see one who is too high for grief or joy, they curse him and cry, “O
	thou insensible!”
	Therefore Christ still hangs on the cross in Jerusalem.
</p>
<p class="P">
	37. Men are in love with sin; when they see one who is too high for vice or virtue, they curse him and cry, “O thou
	breaker of bonds, thou wicked and immoral one!”
	Therefore Srikrishna does not live as yet in Brindavun.
</p>
<p class="P">
	38. Some say Krishna never lived, he is a myth.
	They mean on earth; for if Brindavun existed nowhere, the Bhagwat could not have been written.
</p>
<p class="P">
	39. Strange! the Germans have disproved the existence of Christ; yet his crucifixion remains still a greater
	historic fact than the death of Caesar.
</p>
<p class="P">
	40. Sometimes one is led to think that only those things really matter which have never happened; for beside them
	most historic achievements seem almost pale and ineffective.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 428</p>
<p class="P">
	41. There are four very great events in history, the siege of Troy, the life and crucifixion of Christ, the exile of
	Krishna in Brindavun and the colloquy with Arjuna on the field of Kurukshetra.
	The siege of Troy created Hellas, the exile in Brindavun created devotional religion, (for before there was only
	meditation and worship,) Christ from his cross humanised Europe, the colloquy at Kurukshetra will yet liberate
	humanity.
	Yet it is said that none of these four events ever happened.
</p>
<p class="P">
	42. They say that the Gospels are forgeries and Krishna a creation of the poets.
	Thank God then for the forgeries and bow down before the creators.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="143" href="#">2</a>
</p>
<p class="P">
	43. If God assigns to me my place in Hell, I do not know why I should aspire to Heaven.
	He knows best what is for my welfare.
</p>
<p class="P">
	44. If God draw me towards Heaven, then, even if His other hand strive to keep me in Hell, yet must I struggle
	upward.
</p>
<p class="P">
	45. Only those thoughts are true the opposite of which is also true in its own time and application; indisputable
	dogmas are the most dangerous kind of falsehoods.
</p>
<p class="P">
	46. Logic is the worst enemy of Truth, as self-righteousness is the worst enemy of virtue, — for the one cannot see
	its own errors nor the other its own imperfections.
</p>
<p class="P">
	47. When I was asleep in the Ignorance, I came to a place of meditation full of holy men and I found their company
	wearisome and the place a prison; when I awoke, God took me to a prison and turned it into a place of meditation and
	His try sting-ground.
</p>
<p class="P">
	48. When I read a wearisome book through and with pleasure, yet perceived all the perfection of its wearisomeness,
	then I knew that my mind was conquered.
</p>
<p class="P">
	49. I knew my mind to be conquered when it admired the beauty of the hideous, yet felt perfectly why other men
	shrank back or hated.
</p>
<p class="P">
	50. To feel and love the God of beauty and good in the ugly and the evil, and still yearn in utter love to heal it
	of its ugliness and its evil, this is real virtue and morality.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 429</p>
<p class="P">
	51. To hate the sinner is the worst sin, for it is hating God; yet he who commits it, glories in his superior
	virtue.
</p>
<p class="P">
	52. When I hear of a righteous wrath, I wonder at man's capacity for self-deception.
</p>
<p class="P">
	53. This is a miracle that men can love God, yet fail to love humanity.
	With whom are they in love then?
</p>
<p class="P">
	54. The quarrels of religious sects are like the disputing of pots, which shall be alone allowed to hold the
	immortalising nectar.
	Let them dispute, but the thing for us is to get at the nectar in whatever pot and attain immortality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	55. You say that the flavour of the pot alters the liquor.
	That is taste; but what can deprive it of its immortalising faculty?
</p>
<p class="P">
	56. Be wide in me, O Varuna; be mighty in me, O Indra; O Sun, be very bright and luminous; O Moon, be full of charm
	and sweetness.
	Be fierce and terrible, O Rudra; be impetuous and swift, O Maruts; be strong and bold, O Aryama; be voluptuous and
	pleasurable, O Bhaga; be tender and kind and loving and passionate, O Mitra.
	Be bright and revealing, O Dawn; O Night, be solemn and pregnant.
	O Life, be full, ready and buoyant; O Death, lead my steps from mansion to mansion.
	Harmonise all these, O Brahmanaspati.
	Let me not be subject to these gods, O Kali.
</p>
<p class="P">
	57. When, O eager disputant, thou hast prevailed in a debate, then art thou greatly to be pitied; for thou hast lost
	a chance of widening knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	58. Because the tiger acts according to his nature and knows not anything else, therefore he is divine and there is
	no evil in him.
	If he questioned himself, then he would be a criminal.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 430</p>
<p class="P">
	59. The animal, before he is corrupted, has not yet eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; the god has
	abandoned it for the tree of eternal life; man stands between the upper heaven and the lower nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	60. One of the greatest comforts of religion is that you can get hold of God sometimes and give him a satisfactory
	beating.
	People mock at the folly of savages who beat their gods when their prayers are not answered; but it is the mockers
	who are the fools and the savages.
</p>
<p class="P">
	61. There is no mortality.
	It is only the Immortal who can die; the mortal could neither be born nor perish.
	There is nothing finite.
	It is only the Infinite who can make for Himself limits; the finite can have no beginning nor end, for the very act
	of conceiving its beginning and end declares its infinity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	62. I heard a fool discoursing utter folly and wondered what God meant by it; then I considered and saw a distorted
	mask of truth and wisdom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	63. God is great, says the Mahomedan.
	Yes, He is so great that He can afford to be weak, whenever that too is necessary.
</p>
<p class="P">
	64. God often fails in His workings; it is the sign of His illimitable godhead.
</p>
<p class="P">
	65. Because God is invincibly great, He can afford to be weak; because He is immutably pure, He can indulge with
	impunity in sin; He knows eternally all delight, therefore He tastes also the delight of pain; He is inalienably
	wise, therefore He has not debarred Himself from folly.
</p>
<p class="P">
	66. Sin is that which was once in its place, persisting now it is out of place; there is no other sinfulness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	67. There is no sin in man, but a great deal of disease, ignorance and misapplication.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 431</p>
<p class="P">
	68. The sense of sin was necessary in order that man might become disgusted with his own imperfections.
	It was God's corrective for egoism.
	But man's egoism meets God's device by being very dully alive to its own sins and very keenly alive to the sins of
	others.
</p>
<p class="P">
	69. Sin and virtue are a game of resistance we play with God in His efforts to draw us towards perfection.
	The sense of virtue helps us to cherish our sins in secret.
</p>
<p class="P">
	70. Examine thyself without pity, then thou wilt be more charitable and pitiful to others.
</p>
<p class="P">
	71. A thought is an arrow shot at the truth; it can hit a point, but not cover the whole target.
	But the archer is too well satisfied with his success to ask anything farther.
</p>
<p class="P">
	72. The sign of dawning Knowledge is to feel that as yet I know little or nothing, and yet, if I could only know my
	knowledge, I already possess everything.
</p>
<p class="P">
	73. When Wisdom comes, her first lesson is, “There is no such thing as knowledge; there are only apercus of the
	Infinite Deity.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	74. Practical knowledge is a different thing; that is real and serviceable, but it is never complete.
	Therefore to systematise and codify it is necessary but fatal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	75. Systematise we must, but even in making and holding the system, we should always keep firm hold on this truth
	that all systems are in their nature transitory and incomplete.
</p>
<p class="P">
	76. Europe prides herself on her practical and scientific organisation and efficiency.
	I am waiting till her organisation is perfect; then a child shall destroy her.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 432</p>
<p class="P">
	77. Genius discovers a system; average talent stereotypes it till it is shattered by fresh genius.
	It is dangerous for an army to be led by veterans; for on the other side God may place Napoleon.
</p>
<p class="P">
	78. When knowledge is fresh in us, then it is invincible; when it is old, it loses its virtue.
	This is because God moves always forward.
</p>
<p class="P">
	79. God is infinite Possibility.
	Therefore Truth is never at rest; therefore, also, Error is justified of her children.
</p>
<p class="P">
	80. To listen to some devout people, one would imagine that God never laughs; Heine was nearer the mark when he
	found in Him the divine Aristophanes.
</p>
<p class="P">
	81. God's laughter is sometimes very coarse and unfit for polite ears; He is not satisfied with being Moliere, He
	must needs also be Aristophanes and Rabelais.
</p>
<p class="P">
	82. If men took life less seriously, they could very soon make it more perfect.
	God never takes His works seriously; therefore one looks out on this wonderful Universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	83. Shame has admirable results and both in aesthetics and in morality we could ill spare it; but for all that it is

	84. The supernatural is that the nature of which we have not attained or do not yet know, or the means of which we
	have not yet conquered.
	The common taste for miracles is the sign that man's ascent is not yet finished.
</p>
<p class="P">
	85. It is rationality and prudence to distrust the supernatural; but to believe in it, is also a sort of wisdom.

</p>
<p class="P">
	91. If Life alone were and not death, there could be no immortality; if love were alone and not cruelty, joy would
	be only a tepid and ephemeral rapture; if reason were alone and not ignorance, our highest attainment would not
	exceed a limited rationality and worldly wisdom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	92. Death transformed becomes Life that is Immortality; Cruelty transfigured becomes Love that is intolerable
	ecstasy; Ignorance transmuted becomes Light that leaps beyond wisdom and knowledge.

	She has three stages of her schooling, endurance first, next equality of soul, last ecstasy.

	94. All renunciation is for a greater joy yet ungrasped.
	Some renounce for the joy of duty done, some for the joy of peace, some for the joy of God and some for the joy of
	self-torture, but renounce rather as a passage to the freedom and untroubled rapture beyond.

</p>
<p class="P">

	Dost thou not hear His self-delighted laughter behind thy soul's curtains?

<p class="P">
	98. Revelation is the direct sight, the direct hearing or the inspired memory of Truth, drishti, sruti, smriti; it

	Not because God spoke it, but because the soul saw it, is the word of the Scriptures our supreme authority.

	103. Vivekananda, exalting Sannyasa, has said that in all Indian history there is only one Janaka.
	Not so, for Janaka is not the name of a single individual, but a dynasty of self-ruling kings and the triumph-cry of
	an ideal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	104. In all the lakhs of ochre-clad Sannyasins, how many are perfect?
	It is the few attainments and the many approximations that justify an ideal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	105. There have been hundreds of perfect Sannyasins, because Sannyasa had been widely preached and numerously
	practised; let it be the same with the ideal freedom and we shall have hundreds of Janakas.
</p>
<p class="P">
	106. Sannyasa has a formal garb and outer tokens; therefore men think they can easily recognise it; but the freedom
	of a Janaka does not proclaim itself and it wears the garb of the world; to its presence even Narada was blinded.
</p>
<p class="P">
	107. Hard is it to be in the world, free, yet living the life of ordinary men; but because it is hard, therefore it
	must be attempted and accomplished.
</p>
<p class="P">
	108. When he watched the actions of Janaka, even Narada the divine sage thought him a luxurious worldling and
	libertine.
	Unless thou canst see the soul, how shalt thou say that a man is free or bound?

<p class="P">

	Science as the playthings of babies.
</p>
<p class="P">
	111. Knowledge is a child with its achievements; for when it has found out something, it runs about the streets
	whooping and shouting; Wisdom conceals hers for a long time in a thoughtful and mighty silence.
</p>

	112. Science talks and behaves as if it had conquered all knowledge: Wisdom, as she walks, hears her solitary tread

<p class="P">
	113. Hatred is the sign of a secret attraction that is eager to flee from itself and furious to deny its own

	The period seems to begin and end, but the fraction is eternal; it will never have an end and never had any real
	beginning.

<p class="P">
	116. The beginning and end of things is a conventional term of our experience; in their true existence these terms

<p class="P">
	117. “Neither is it that I was not before nor thou nor these kings nor that all we shall not be hereafter.”
	Not only Brahman, but beings and things in Brahman are eternal; their creation and destruction is a play of hide and

<p class="P">

	125. Every law, however embracing or tyrannous, meets somewhere a contrary law by which its operation can be
	checked, modified, annulled or eluded.
</p>
<p class="P">
	126. The most binding Law of Nature is only a fixed process which the Lord of Nature has framed and uses constantly;

	live less in Nature than in the Spirit.

	128. Live according to Nature, runs the maxim of the West; but according to what nature, the nature of the body or
	the nature which exceeds the body?

	131. Because God has willed and foreseen everything, thou shouldst not therefore sit inactive and wait upon His
	providence, for thy action is one of His chief effective forces.
	Up then and be doing, not with egoism, but as the circumstance, instrument and apparent cause of the event that He

<p class="P">
	132. When I knew nothing, then I abhorred the criminal, sinful and impure, being myself full of crime, sin and
	impurity; but when I was cleansed and my eyes unsealed, then I bowed down in my spirit before the thief and the
	murderer and adored the feet of the harlot; for I saw that these souls had accepted the terrible burden of evil and
	drained for all of us the greater portion of the churned poison of the world-ocean.
</p>
<p class="P">
	133. The Titans are stronger than the gods because they have agreed with God to front and bear the burden of His
	wrath and enmity; the gods were able to accept only the pleasant burden of His love and kindlier rapture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	134. When thou art able to see how necessary is suffering to final delight, failure to utter effectiveness and
	retardation to the last rapidity, then thou mayst begin to understand something, however faintly and dimly, of God's
	workings.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 439</p>
<p class="P">
	135. All disease is a means towards some new joy of health, all evil and pain a tuning of Nature for some more
	intense bliss and good, all death an opening on widest immortality.
	Why and how this should be so, is God's secret which only the soul purified of egoism can penetrate.
</p>
<p class="P">
	136. Why is thy mind or thy body in pain?
	Because thy soul behind the veil wishes for the pain or takes delight in it; but if thou wilt — and perseverest in
	thy will — thou canst impose the spirit's law of unmixed delight on thy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="144" href="#">3</a> lower members.
</p>
<p class="P">
	137. There is no iron or ineffugable law that a given contact shall create pain or pleasure; it is the way the soul
	meets the rush or pressure of Brahman upon the members from outside them that determines either reaction.
</p>
<p class="P">
	138. The force of soul in thee meeting the same force from out side cannot harmonise the measures of the contact in
	values of mind-experience and body-experience, therefore thou hast pain, grief or uneasiness.
	If thou canst learn to adjust the replies of the force in thyself to the questions of world-force, thou shalt find
	pain becoming pleasurable or turning into pure delightfulness.
	Right relation is the condition of blissfulness, ritam the key of ananda.
</p>
<p class="P">
	139. Who is the superman?
	He who can rise above this matter-regarding broken mental human unit and possess himself universalised and deified
	in a divine force, a divine love and joy and a divine knowledge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	140. If thou keepest this limited human ego and thinkest thyself the superman, thou art but the fool of thy own
	pride, the plaything of thy own force and the instrument of thy own illusions.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 440</p>
<p class="P">
	141. Nietzsche saw the superman as the lion-soul passing out of camel-hood, but the true heraldic device and token
	of the superman is the lion seated upon the camel which stands upon the cow of plenty.
	If thou canst not be the slave of all mankind, thou art not fit to be its master and if thou canst not make thy
	nature as Vasistha's cow of plenty with all mankind to draw its wish from her udders, what avails thy leonine
	supermanhood?
</p>
<p class="P">
	142. Be to the world as the lion in fearlessness and lordship, as the camel in patience and service, as the cow in
	quiet, forbearing and maternal beneficence.
	Raven on all the joys of God as a lion over its prey, but bring also all humanity into that infinite field of
	luxurious ecstasy to wallow there and to pasture.

<p class="P">
	143. If Art's<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="145" href="#">4</a> service is but to imitate Nature, then burn all the
	picture galleries and let us have instead photographic studios.
	It is because Art reveals what Nature<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="146" href="#">5</a> hides, that a small picture is
	worth more than all the jewels of the millionaires and the treasures of the princes.
</p>
<p class="P">
	144. If you only imitate visible Nature, you will perpetrate either a corpse, a dead sketch or a monstrosity; Truth
	lives in that which goes behind and beyond the visible and sensible.
</p>
<p class="P">
	145. O Poet, O Artist, if thou but boldest up the mirror to Nature, thinkest thou Nature will rejoice in thy work?
	Rather she will turn away her face.
	For what dost thou hold up to her there?
	Herself?
	No, but a lifeless outline and reflection, a shadowy mimicry.
	It is the secret soul of Nature thou hast to seize, thou hast to hunt eternally after the truth in the external
	symbol, and that no mirror will hold for thee, nor for her whom thou seekest.
</p>
<p class="P">
	146. I find in Shakespeare a far greater and more consistent universalist than the Greeks.
	All his creations are universal types from Lancelot Gobbo and his dog up to Lear and Hamlet.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 441</p>
<p class="P">
	147. The Greeks sought universality by omitting all finer individual touches; Shakespeare sought it more
	successfully by universalising the rarest individual details of character.
	That which Nature uses for concealing from us the Infinite, Shakespeare used for revealing the Ananta-guna in man to
	the eye of humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	148. Shakespeare, who invented the figure of holding up the mirror to Nature, was the one poet who never
	condescended to a copy, a photograph or a shadow.
	The reader who sees in Falstaff, Macbeth, Lear or Hamlet imitations of Nature, has either no inner eye of the soul
	or has been hypnotised by a formula.
</p>
<p class="P">
	149. Where in material Nature wilt thou find Falstaff, Macbeth or Lear?
	Shadows and hints of them she possesses but they themselves tower above her.
</p>
<p class="P">
	150. There are two for whom there is hope, the man who has felt God's touch and been drawn to it and the sceptical
	seeker and self-convinced atheist; but for the formularists of all the religions and the parrots of free thought,
	they are dead souls who follow a death that they call living.

	151. A man came to a scientist and wished to be instructed; this instructor showed him the revelations of the
	microscope and telescope, but the man laughed and said, “These are obviously hallucinations inflicted on the eye by
	the glass which you use as a medium; I will not believe till you show these wonders to my naked seeing.”
	Then the scientist proved to him by many collateral facts and experiments the reliability of his knowledge but the
	man laughed again and said, “What you term proofs, I term coincidences, the number of coincidences does not
	constitute proof; as for your experiments, they are obviously effected under abnormal conditions and constitute a
	sort of insanity of Nature.”
	When confronted with the results of mathematics, he was angry and cried out, “This is obviously imposture, gibberish
	and superstition; will you try to make me believe that these absurd cabalistic figures have any real force and
	meaning?”
	Then the scientist drove him out as a hopeless imbecile; for he did not recognise his own system of denials and his
	own method of negative reasoning.
	If we wish to refuse an impartial and openminded enquiry, we can always find the most respectable polysyllables to
	cover our refusal or impose tests and conditions which stultify the enquiry.
</p>
<p class="P">
	152. When our minds are involved in matter, they think matter the only reality; when we draw back into immaterial
	consciousness, then we see matter a mask and feel existence in consciousness alone as having the touch of reality.
	Which then of these two is the truth?
	Nay, God knoweth; but he who has had both experiences, can easily tell which condition is the more fertile in
	knowledge, the mightier and more blissful.
</p>
<p class="P">
	153. I believe immaterial consciousness to be truer than material consciousness?
	Because I know in the first what in the second is hidden from me and also can command what the mind knows in matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	154. Hell and Heaven exist only in the soul's consciousness.
	Ay, but so does the earth and its lands and seas and fields and deserts and mountains and rivers.
	All world is nothing but arrangement of the Soul's seeing.
</p>
<p class="P">
	155. There is only one soul and one existence; therefore we all see one objectivity only; but there are many knots
	of mind and ego in the one soul-existence, therefore we all see the one Object in different lights and shadows.
</p>
<p class="P">
	156. The idealist errs; it is not Mind which created the worlds, but that which created mind has created them.
	Mind only mis-sees, because it sees partially and by details, what is created.
</p>
<p class="P">
	157. Thus said Ramakrishna and thus said Vivekananda.
	Yes, but let me know also the truths which the Avatar cast not forth into speech and the prophet has omitted from
	his teachings.
	There will always be more in God than the thought of man has ever conceived or the tongue of man has ever uttered.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 443</p>
<p class="P">
	158. What was Ramakrishna?
	God manifest in a human being; but behind there is God in His infinite impersonality and His universal Personality.
	And what was Vivekananda?
	A radiant glance from the eye of Shiva; but behind him is the divine gaze from which he came and Shiva himself and
	Brahma and Vishnu and OM all-exceeding.
</p>
<p class="P">
	159. He who recognises not Krishna, the God in man, knows not God entirely; he who knows Krishna only, knows not
	even Krishna.
	Yet is the opposite truth also wholly true that if thou canst see all God in a little pale unsightly and scentless
	flower, then hast thou hold of His supreme reality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	160. Shun the barren snare of an empty metaphysics and the dry dust of an unfertile intellectuality.
	Only that knowledge is worth having which can be made use of for a living delight and put out into temperament,
	action, creation and being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	161. Become and live the knowledge thou hast; then is thy knowledge the living God within thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	162. Evolution is not finished; reason is not the last word nor the reasoning animal the supreme figure of Nature.
	As man emerged out of the animal, so out of man the superman emerges.
</p>
<p class="P">
	163. The power to observe law rigidly is the basis of freedom; therefore in most disciplines the soul has to endure
	and fulfil the law in its lower members before it can rise to the perfect freedom of its divine being.
	Those disciplines which begin with freedom are only for the mighty ones who are naturally free or in former lives
	have founded their freedom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	164. Those who are deficient in the free, full and intelligent observation of a self-imposed law, must be placed in
	subjection to the will of others.
	This is one principal cause of the subjection of nations.
	After their disturbing egoism has been trampled under the feet of a master, they are given or, if they have force in
	them, attain a fresh chance of deserving liberty by liberty.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 444</p>
<p class="P">
	165. To observe the law we have imposed on ourselves rather than the law of others is what is meant by liberty in
	our unregenerate condition.
	Only in God and by the supremacy of the spirit can we enjoy a perfect freedom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	166. The double law of sin and virtue is imposed on us because we have not that ideal life and knowledge within
	which guides the soul spontaneously and infallibly to its self-fulfilment.
	The law of sin and virtue ceases for us when the sun of God shines upon the soul in truth and love with its unveiled
	splendour.
	Moses is replaced by Christ, the Shastra by the Veda.
</p>
<p class="P">
	167. God within is leading us always aright even when we are in the bonds of the ignorance; but then, though the
	goal is sure, it is attained by circlings and deviations.
</p>
<p class="P">
	168. The Cross is in Yoga the symbol of the soul and nature in their strong and perfect union, but because of our
	fall into the impurities of ignorance it has become the symbol of suffering and purification.
</p>
<p class="P">
	169. Christ came into the world to purify, not to fulfil.
	He himself foreknew the failure of his mission and the necessity of his return with the sword of God into a world
	that had rejected him.
</p>
<p class="P">
	170. Mahomed's mission was necessary, else we might have ended by thinking, in the exaggeration of our efforts at
	self-purification, that earth was meant only for the monk and the city created as a vestibule for the desert.
</p>
<p class="P">
	171. When all is said, Love and Force together can save the world eventually, but not Love only or Force only.
	Therefore Christ had to look forward to a second advent and Mahomed's religion, where it is not stagnant, looks
	forward through the Imams to a Mahdi.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 445</p>
<p class="P">
	172. Law cannot save the world, therefore Moses' ordinances are dead for humanity and the Shastra of the Brahmins is
	corrupt and dying.
	Law released into Freedom is the liberator.
	Not the Pandit, but the Yogin; not monasticism, but the inner renunciation of desire and ignorance and egoism.
</p>
<p class="P">
	173. Even Vivekananda once in the stress of emotion admitted the fallacy that a personal God would be too immoral to
	be suffered and it would be the duty of all good men to resist Him.
	But if an omnipotent supra-moral Will and Intelligence governs the world, it is surely impossible to resist Him; our
	resistance would only serve His ends and really be dictated by Him.
	Is it not better then, instead of condemning or denying, to study and understand Him?
</p>
<p class="P">
	174. If we would understand God, we must renounce our egoistic and ignorant human standards or else ennoble and
	universalise them.
</p>
<p class="P">
	175. Because a good man dies or fails and the evil live and triumph, is God therefore evil?
	I do not see the logic of the consequence.
	I must first be convinced that death and failure are evil; I sometimes think that when they come, they are our
	supreme momentary good.
	But we are the fools of our hearts and nerves and argue that what they do not like or desire, must of course be an
	evil!
</p>
<p class="P">
	176. When I look back on my past life, I see that if I had not failed and suffered, I would have lost my life's
	supreme blessings; yet at the time of the suffering and failure, I was vexed with the sense of calamity.
	Because we cannot see anything but the one fact under our noses, therefore we indulge in all these snifflings and
	clamours.
	Be silent, ye foolish hearts! slay the ego, learn to see and feel vastly and universally.
</p>
<p class="P">
	177. The perfect cosmic vision and cosmic sentiment is the cure of all error and suffering; but most men succeed
	only in enlarging the range of their ego.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 446</p>
<p class="P">
	178. Men say and think “For my country!”
	“For humanity!”
	“For the world!” but they really mean “For myself seen in my country!”
	“For myself seen in humanity!”
	“For myself imaged to my fancy as the world!”
	That may be an enlargement, but it is not liberation.
	To be at large and to be in a large prison are not one condition of freedom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	179. Live for God in thy neighbour, God in thyself, God in thy country and the country of thy foeman, God in
	humanity, God in tree and stone and animal, God in the world and outside the world, then art thou on the straight
	path to liberation.

	When the Scriptures say “saswatih samah”, they mean for a long space and permanence of time or a hardly measurable
	aeon; only God Absolute has the absolute eternity.
	Yet when one goes within, one sees that all things are secretly eternal; there is no end, neither was there ever a
	beginning.
</p>
<p class="P">
	181. When thou callest another a fool, as thou must, sometimes, yet do not forget that thou thyself hast been the
	supreme fool in humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	182. God loves to play the fool in season; man does it in season and out of season.
	It is the only difference.
</p>
<p class="P">
	183. In the Buddhists' view to have saved an ant from drowning is a greater work than to have founded an empire.
	There is a truth in the idea, but a truth that can easily be exaggerated.
</p>
<p class="P">
	184. To exalt one virtue, — compassion even, — unduly above all others is to cover up with one's hand the eyes of
	wisdom.
	God moves always towards a harmony.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 447</p>
<p class="P">
	185. Pity may be reserved, so long as thy soul makes distinctions, for the suffering animals; but humanity deserves
	from thee something nobler; it asks for love, for understanding, for comradeship, for the help of the equal and
	brother.
</p>
<p class="P">
	186. The contributions of evil to the good of the world and the harm sometimes done by the virtuous are distressing
	to the soul enamoured of good.
	Nevertheless be not distressed nor confounded, but study rather and calmly understand God's ways with humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	187. In God's providence there is no evil, but only good or its preparation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	188. Virtue and vice were made for thy soul's struggle and progress; but for results they belong to God, who fulfils
	himself beyond vice and virtue.
</p>
<p class="P">
	189. Live within; be not shaken by outward happenings.
</p>
<p class="P">
	190. Fling not thy alms abroad everywhere in an ostentation of charity; understand and love where thou helpest.
	Let thy soul grow within thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	191. Help the poor while the poor are with thee; but study also and strive that there may be no poor for thy
	assistance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	192. The old Indian social ideal demanded of the priest voluntary simplicity of life, purity, learning and the
	gratuitous instruction of the community, of the prince, war, government, protection of the weak and the giving up of
	his life in the battlefield, of the merchant, trade, gain and the return of his gains to the community by free
	giving, of the serf, labour for the rest and material havings.
	In atonement for his serfhood, it spared him the tax of self-denial, the tax of blood and the tax of his riches.
</p>
<p class="P">
	193. The existence of poverty is the proof of an unjust and ill-organised society, and our public charities are but
	the first tardy awakening in the conscience of a robber.
</p>
<p class="P">
	194. Valmekie, our ancient epic poet, includes among the signs of a just and enlightened state of society not only
	universal education, morality and spirituality but this also that there shall be “none who is compelled to eat
	coarse food, none uncrowned and unanointed or who is restricted to a mean and petty share of luxuries.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	195. The acceptance of poverty is noble and beneficial in a class or an individual, but it becomes fatal and
	pauperises life of its richness and expansion if it is perverted into a general or national ideal.
	Athens, not Sparta, is the progressive type for mankind.
	Ancient India with its ideal of vast riches and vast spending was the greatest of nations; modern India with its
	trend towards national asceticism has finally become poor in life and sunk into weakness and degradation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	196. Poverty is no more a necessity of organised social life than disease of the natural body; false habits of life
	and an ignorance of our true organisation are in both cases the peccant causes of an avoidable disorder.
</p>
<p class="P">
	197. Do not dream that when thou hast got rid of material poverty, men will even so be happy or satisfied or society
	freed from ills, troubles and problems.
	This is only the first and lowest necessity.
	While the soul within remains defectively organised, there will always be outward unrest, disorder and revolution.
</p>
<p class="P">
	198. Disease will always return to the body if the soul is flawed; for the sins of the mind are the secret cause of
	the sins of the body.
	So too poverty and trouble will always return on man in society, so long as the mind of the race is subjected to
	egoism.
</p>
<p class="P">
	199. Religion and philosophy seek to rescue man from his ego; then the kingdom of heaven within will be
	spontaneously reflected in an external divine city.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 449</p>
<p class="P">
	200. Mediaeval Christianity said to the race, “Man, thou art in thy earthly life an evil thing and a worm before
	God; renounce then egoism, live for a future state and submit thyself to God and His priest.”
	The results were not over-good for humanity.
	Modern knowledge says to the race, “Man, thou art an ephemeral animal and no more to Nature than the ant and the
	earthworm, — a transitory speck only in the universe.
	Live then for the State and submit thyself antlike to the trained administrator and the scientific expert.”
	Will this gospel succeed any better than the other?
</p>
<p class="P">
	201. Vedanta says rather, “Man, thou art of one nature and substance with God, one soul with thy fellow-men.
	Awake and progress then to thy utter divinity, live for God in thyself and in others.”
	This gospel which was given only to the few, must now be offered to all mankind for its deliverance.
</p>
<p class="P">
	202. The human race always progresses most when most it asserts its importance to Nature, its freedom and its
	universality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	203. Animal man is the obscure starting-point, the present natural man the varied and tangled mid-road but
	supernatural man the luminous and transcendent goal of our human journey.
</p>
<p class="P">
	204. Life and action culminate and are eternally crowned for thee when thou hast attained the power of symbolising
	and manifesting in every thought and act, in wealth getting, wealth having or wealth spending, in home and
	government and society, in art, literature and life, the One Immortal in this lower mortal being.

	Karma
</h1>
<p class="P">
	205. God leads man while man is misleading himself, the higher nature watches over the stumblings of his lower
	mortality; this is the tangle and contradiction out of which we have to escape into the [? self-unity] to which
	alone is possible a clear knowledge and a faultless action.
</p>
<p class="P">
	206. That thou shouldst have pity on creatures, is well, but not well, if thou art a slave to thy pity.
	Be a slave to nothing except to God, not even to His most luminous angels.
</p>
<p class="P">
	207. Beatitude is God's aim for humanity; get this supreme good for thyself first that thou mayst distribute it
	entirely to thy fellow-beings.
</p>
<p class="P">
	208. He who acquires for himself alone, acquires ill though he may call it heaven and virtue.
</p>
<p class="P">
	209. In my ignorance I thought anger could be noble and vengeance grandiose; but now when I watch Achilles in his
	epic fury, I see a very fine baby in a very fine rage and I am pleased and amused.
</p>
<p class="P">
	210. Power is noble, when it overtops anger; destruction is grandiose, but it loses caste when it proceeds from
	vengeance.
	Leave these things, for they belong to a lower humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	211. Poets make much of death and external afflictions; but the only tragedies are the soul's failures and the only
	epic man's triumphant ascent towards godhead.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 454</p>
<p class="P">
	212. The tragedies of the heart and the body are the weeping of children over their little griefs and their broken
	toys.
	Smile within thyself, but comfort the children; join also, if thou canst, in their play.
</p>
<p class="P">
	213. “There is always something abnormal and eccentric about men of genius.”
	And why not?
	For genius itself is an abnormal birth and out of man's ordinary centre.
</p>
<p class="P">
	214. Genius is Nature's first attempt to liberate the imprisoned god out of her human mould; the mould has to suffer
	in the process.
	It is astonishing that the cracks are so few and unimportant.
</p>
<p class="P">
	215. Nature sometimes gets into a fury with her own resistance, then she damages the brain in order to free the
	inspiration; for in this effort the equilibrium of the average material brain is her chief opponent.
	Pass over the madness of such and profit by their inspiration.
</p>
<p class="P">
	216. Who can bear Kali rushing into the system in her fierce force and burning godhead?
	Only the man whom Krishna already possesses.
</p>
<p class="P">
	217. Hate not the oppressor, for, if he is strong, thy hate increases his force of resistance; if he is weak, thy
	hate was needless.
</p>
<p class="P">
	218. Hatred is a sword of power, but its edge is always double.
	It is like the Kritya of the ancient magicians which, if baulked of its prey, returned in fury to devour its sender.
</p>
<p class="P">
	219. Love God in thy opponent, even while thou strikest him; so shall neither have hell for his portion.
</p>
<p class="P">
	220. Men talk of enemies, but where are they?
	I only see wrestlers of one party or the other in the great arena of the universe.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 455</p>
<p class="P">
	221. The saint and the angel are not the only divinities; admire also the Titan and the giant.
</p>
<p class="P">
	222. The old writings call the Titans the elder gods.
	So they still are; nor is any god entirely divine unless there is hidden in him also a Titan.
</p>
<p class="P">
	223. If I cannot be Rama, then I would be Ravana; for he is the dark side of Vishnu.
</p>
<p class="P">
	224. Sacrifice, sacrifice, sacrifice always, but for the sake of God and humanity, not for the sake of sacrifice.
</p>
<p class="P">
	225. Selfishness kills the soul; destroy it.
	But take care that your altruism does not kill the souls of others.
</p>
<p class="P">
	226. Very usually, altruism is only the sublimest form of selfishness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	227. He who will not slay when God bids him, works in the world an incalculable havoc.
</p>
<p class="P">
	228. Respect human life as long as you can; but respect more the life of humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	229. Men slay out of uncontrollable anger, hatred or vengeance; they shall suffer the rebound now or hereafter; or
	they slay to serve a selfish end, coldly; God shall not pardon them.
	If thou slay, first let thy soul have known death for a reality and seen God in the smitten, the stroke and the
	striker.
</p>
<p class="P">
	230. Courage and love are the only indispensable virtues; even if all the others are eclipsed or fall asleep,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="147" href="#">1</a> these two will save the soul alive.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 456</p>
<p class="P">
	231. Meanness and selfishness are the only sins that I find it difficult to pardon; yet they alone are almost
	universal.
	Therefore these also must not be hated in others, but in ourselves annihilated.
</p>
<p class="P">
	232. Nobleness and generosity are the soul's ethereal firmament; without them, one looks at an insect in a dungeon.
</p>
<p class="P">
	233. Let not thy virtues be such as men praise or reward, but such as make for thy perfection and God in thy nature
	demands of thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	234. Altruism, duty, family, country, humanity are the prisons of the soul when they are not its instruments.
</p>
<p class="P">
	235. Our country is God the Mother; speak not evil of her unless thou canst do it with love and tenderness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	236. Men are false to their country for their own profit; yet they go on thinking they have a right to turn in
	horror from the matricide.
</p>
<p class="P">
	237. Break the moulds of the past, but keep safe its gains and its spirit, or else thou hast no future.
</p>
<p class="P">
	238. Revolutions hew the past to pieces and cast it into a cauldron, but what has emerged is the old Aeson with a
	new visage.
</p>
<p class="P">
	239. The world has had only half a dozen successful revolutions and most even of these were very like failures; yet
	it is by great and noble failures that humanity advances.
</p>
<p class="P">
	240. Atheism is a necessary protest against the wickedness of the Churches and the narrowness of creeds.
	God uses it as a stone to smash these soiled card-houses.
</p>
<p class="P">
	241. How much hatred and stupidity men succeed in packing up decorously and labelling “Religion”!
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 457</p>
<p class="P">
	242. God guides best when He tempts worst, loves entirely when He punishes cruelly, helps perfectly when violently
	He opposes.
</p>
<p class="P">
	243. If God did not take upon Himself the burden of tempting men, the world would very soon go to perdition.
</p>
<p class="P">
	244. Suffer yourself to be tempted within so that you may exhaust in the struggle your downward propensities.
</p>
<p class="P">
	245. If you leave it to God to purify, He will exhaust the evil in you subjectively; but if you insist on guiding
	yourself, you will fall into much outward sin and suffering.
</p>
<p class="P">
	246. Call not everything evil which men call evil, but only that reject which God has rejected; call not everything
	good which men call good, but accept only what God has accepted.
</p>
<p class="P">
	247. Men in the world have two lights, duty and principle; but he who has passed over to God, has done with both and
	replaced them by God's will.
	If men abuse thee for this, care not, O divine instrument, but go on thy way like the wind or the sun fostering and
	destroying.
</p>
<p class="P">
	248. Not to cull the praises of men has God made thee His own, but to do fearlessly His bidding.
</p>
<p class="P">
	249. Accept the world as God's theatre; be thou the mask of the Actor and let Him act through thee.
	If men praise or hiss thee, know that they too are masks and take God within for thy only critic and audience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	250. If Krishna be alone on one side and the armed and organised world with its hosts and its shrapnel and its
	Maxims on the other, yet prefer thy divine solitude.
	Care not if the world passes over thy body and its shrapnel tear thee to pieces and its cavalry trample thy limbs
	into shapeless mire by the wayside; for the mind was always a simulacrum and the body a carcass.
	The spirit liberated from its casings ranges and triumphs.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 458</p>
<p class="P">
	251. If thou think defeat is the end of thee, then go not forth to fight, even though thou be the stronger.
	For Fate is not purchased by any man nor is Power bound over to her possessors.
	But defeat is not the end, it is only a gate or a beginning.
</p>
<p class="P">
	252. I have failed, thou sayest.
	Say rather that God is circling about towards His object.
</p>
<p class="P">
	253. Foiled by the world, thou turnest to seize upon God.
	If the world is stronger than thou, thinkest thou God is weaker?
	Turn to Him rather for His bidding and for strength to fulfil it.
</p>
<p class="P">
	254. So long as a cause has on its side one soul that is intangible in faith, it cannot perish.
</p>
<p class="P">
	255. Reason gives me no basis for this faith, thou murmurest.
	Fool! if it did, faith would not be needed or demanded of thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	256. Faith in the heart is the obscure and often distorted reflection of a hidden knowledge.
	The believer is often more plagued by doubt than the most inveterate sceptic.
	He persists because there is something subconscient in him which knows.
	That tolerates both his blind faith and twilit doubts and drives towards the revelation of that which it knows.
</p>
<p class="P">
	257. The world thinks that it moves by the light of reason but it is really impelled by its faiths and instincts.
</p>
<p class="P">
	258. Reason adapts itself to the faith or argues out a justification of the instincts, but it receives the impulse
	subconsciously; therefore men think that they act rationally.
</p>
<p class="P">
	259. The only business of reason is to arrange and criticise the perceptions.
	It has neither in itself any means of positive conclusion nor any command to action.
	When it pretends to originate or impel, it is masking other agencies.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 459</p>
<p class="P">
	260. Until Wisdom comes to thee, use the reason for its God-given purposes and faith and instinct for theirs.
	Why shouldst thou set thy members to war upon each other?
</p>
<p class="P">
	261. Perceive always and act in the light of thy increasing perceptions, but not those of the reasoning brain only.
	God speaks to the heart when the brain cannot understand him.
</p>
<p class="P">
	262. If thy heart tell thee, Thus and by such means and at such a time it will happen, believe it not.
	But if it gives thee the purity and wideness of God's command, hearken to it.
</p>
<p class="P">
	263. When thou hast the command, care only to fulfil it.
	The rest is God's will and arrangement which men call chance and luck and fortune.
</p>
<p class="P">
	264. If thy aim be great and thy means small, still act; for by action alone these can increase to thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	265. Care not for time and success.
	Act out thy part, whether it be to fail or to prosper.
</p>
<p class="P">
	266. There are three forms in which the command may come, the will and faith in thy nature, thy ideal on which heart
	and brain are agreed and the voice of Himself or His angels.
</p>
<p class="P">
	267. There are times when action is unwise or impossible; then go into tapasya in some physical solitude or in the
	retreats of thy soul and await whatever divine word or manifestation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	268. Leap not too quickly at all voices, for there are lying spirits ready to deceive thee; but let thy heart be
	pure and afterwards listen.
</p>
<p class="P">
	269. There are times when God seems to be sternly on the side of the past; then what has been and is, sits firm as
	on a throne and clothes itself with an irrevocable “I shall be”.
	Then persevere, though thou seem to be fighting the Master of all; for this is His sharpest trial.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 460</p>
<p class="P">
	270. All is not settled when a cause is humanly lost and hopeless; all is settled, only when the soul renounces its
	effort.
</p>
<p class="P">
	271. He who would win high spiritual degrees, must pass endless tests and examinations.
	But most are anxious only to bribe the examiner.
</p>
<p class="P">
	272. Fight, while thy hands are free, with thy hands and thy voice and thy brain and all manner of weapons.
	Art thou chained in the enemy's dungeons and have his gags silenced thee?
	Fight with thy silent all-besieging soul and thy wide-ranging will-power and when thou art dead, fight still with
	the world-encompassing force that went out from God within thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	273. Thou thinkest the ascetic in his cave or on his mountaintop a stone and a do-nothing?
	What dost thou know?
	He may be filling the world with the mighty currents of his will and changing it by the pressure of his soul-state.
</p>
<p class="P">
	274. That which the liberated sees in his soul on its mountaintops, heroes and prophets spring up in the material
	world to proclaim and accomplish.
</p>
<p class="P">
	275. The Theosophists are wrong in their circumstances but right in the essential.
	If the French Revolution took place, it was because a soul on the Indian snows dreamed of God as freedom,
	brotherhood and equality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	276. All speech and action comes prepared out of the eternal Silence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	277. There is no disturbance in the depths of the Ocean, but above there is the joyous thunder of its shouting and
	its racing shoreward; so is it with the liberated soul in the midst of violent action.
	The soul does not act; it only breathes out from itself overwhelming action.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 461</p>
<p class="P">
	278. O soldier and hero of God, where for thee is sorrow or shame or suffering?
	For thy life is a glory, thy deeds a consecration, victory thy apotheosis, defeat thy triumph.
</p>
<p class="P">
	279. Do thy lower members still suffer the shock of sin and sorrow?
	But above, seen of thee or unseen, thy soul sits royal, calm, free and triumphant.
	Believe that the Mother will ere the end have done her work and made the very earth of thy being a joy and a purity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	280. If thy heart is troubled within thee, if for long seasons thou makest no progress, if thy strength faint and
	repine, remember always the eternal word of our Lover and Master, “I will free thee from all sin and evil; do not
	grieve.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	281. Purity is in thy soul; but for actions, where is their purity or impurity?
</p>
<p class="P">
	282. O Death, our masked friend and maker of opportunities, when thou wouldst open the gate, hesitate not to tell us
	beforehand; for we are not of those who are shaken by its iron jarring.
</p>
<p class="P">
	283. Death is sometimes a rude valet; but when he changes this robe of earth for that brighter raiment, his
	horseplay and impertinences can be pardoned.
</p>
<p class="P">
	284. Who shall slay thee, O soul immortal?
	Who shall torture thee, O God ever-joyous?
</p>
<p class="P">
	285. Think this when thy members would fain make love with depression and weakness, “I am Bacchus and Ares and
	Apollo; I am Agni pure and invincible; I am Surya ever burning mightily.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	286. Shrink not from the Dionysian cry and rapture within thee, but see that thou be not a straw upon those billows.
</p>
<p class="P">
	287. Thou hast to learn to bear all the gods within thee and never stagger with their inrush or break under their
	burden.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 462</p>
<p class="P">
	288. Mankind have wearied of strength and joy and called sorrow and weakness virtue, wearied of knowledge and called
	ignorance holiness, wearied of love and called heartlessness enlightenment and wisdom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	289. There are many kinds of forbearance.
	I saw a coward hold out his cheek to the smiter; I saw a physical weakling struck by a strong and self-approving
	bully look quietly and intently at the aggressor; I saw God incarnate smile lovingly on those who stoned him.
	The first was ridiculous, the second terrible, the third divine and holy.
</p>
<p class="P">
	290. It is noble to pardon thine own injurers, but not so noble to pardon wrongs done to others.
	Nevertheless pardon these too, but when needful, calmly avenge.
</p>
<p class="P">
	291. When Asiatics massacre, it is an atrocity; when Europeans, it is a military exigency.
	Appreciate the distinction and ponder over this world's virtues.
</p>
<p class="P">
	292. Watch the too indignantly righteous.
	Before long you will find them committing or condoning the very offence which they have so fiercely censured.
</p>
<p class="P">
	293. “There is very little real hypocrisy among men.”
	True, but there is a great deal of diplomacy and still more of self-deceit.
	The last is of three varieties, conscious, subconscious and half-conscious; but the third is the most dangerous.
</p>
<p class="P">
	294. Be not deceived by men's shows of virtue, neither disgusted by their open or secret vices.
	These things are the necessary shufflings in a long transition-period of humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	295. Be not repelled by the world's crookednesses; the world is a wounded and venomous snake wriggling towards a
	destined off-sloughing and perfection.
	Wait; for it is a divine wager, and out of this baseness, God will emerge brilliant and triumphant.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 463</p>
<p class="P">
	296. Why dost thou recoil from a mask?
	Behind its odious, grotesque or terrible seemings Krishna laughs at thy foolish anger, thy more foolish scorn or
	loathing and thy most foolish terror.
</p>
<p class="P">
	297. When thou findest thyself scorning another, look then at thy own heart and laugh at thy folly.
</p>
<p class="P">
	298. Avoid vain disputing; but exchange views freely.
	If dispute thou must, learn from thy adversary; for even from a fool, if thou listen not with the ear and the
	reasoning mind but the soul's light, thou canst gather much wisdom.

	One may be allowed to think more nobly both of God and of woman.

<p class="P">
	303. If a woman has tempted thee, is it her fault or thine?
	Be not a fool and a self-deceiver.

<p class="P">
	304. There are two ways of avoiding the snare of woman; one is to shun all women and the other to love all beings.

<p class="P">

	307. Men labour only after success and if they are fortunate enough to fail, it is because the wisdom and force of

	God alone knows when and how to blunder wisely and fail effectively.

<p class="P">
	308. Distrust the man who has never failed and suffered; follow not his fortunes, fight not under his banner.

	311. Work as if the ideal had to be fulfilled swiftly and in thy lifetime; persevere as if thou knewest it not to be

	That which thou darest not expect till the fifth millennium, may bloom out with tomorrow's dawning and that which

	313. Stride swiftly for the goal is far; rest not unduly, for thy Master is waiting for thee at the end of thy

</p>
<p class="P">
	314. I am weary of the childish impatience which cries and blasphemes and denies the ideal because the Golden

<p class="P">
	315. Fix thy soul without desire upon the end and insist on it by the divine force within thee; then shall the end

	For the end is Brahman and already accomplished; see it always as Brahman, see it always in thy soul as already
	accomplished.
</p>
<p class="P">
	316. Plan not with the intellect, but let thy divine sight arrange thy plans for thee.
	When a means comes to thee as thing to be done, make that thy aim; as for the end, it is, in world, accomplishing
	itself and, in thy soul, already accomplished.
</p>
<p class="P">
	317. Men see events as unaccomplished, to be striven for and effected.
	This is false seeing; events are not effected, they develop.
	The event is Brahman, already accomplished from of old, it is now manifesting.
</p>
<p class="P">
	318. As the light of a star reaches the earth hundreds of years after the star has ceased to exist, so the event
	already accomplished in Brahman at the beginning manifests itself now in our material experience.
</p>
<p class="P">
	319. Governments, societies, kings, police, judges, institutions, churches, laws, customs, armies are temporary
	necessities imposed on us for a few groups of centuries because God has concealed His face from us.
	When it appears to us again in its truth and beauty, then in that light they will vanish.

	straight to the devil and his kingdom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	321. The communistic principle of society is intrinsically as superior to the individualistic as is brotherhood to
	jealousy and mutual slaughter; but all the practical schemes of Socialism invented in Europe are a yoke, a tyranny
	and a prison.
</p>
<p class="P">
	322. If communism ever reestablishes itself successfully upon earth, it must be on a foundation of soul's
	brotherhood and the death of egoism.
	A forced association and a mechanical comradeship would end in a worldwide fiasco.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 466</p>
<p class="P">
	323. Vedanta realised is the only practicable basis for a communistic society.
	It is the kingdom of the saints dreamed of by Christianity, Islam and Puranic Hinduism.
</p>
<p class="P">
	324. “Freedom, equality, brotherhood,” cried the French revolutionists, but in truth freedom only has been practised
	with a dose of equality; as for brotherhood, only a brotherhood of Cain was founded — and of Barabbas.
	Sometimes it calls itself a Trust or Combine and sometimes the Concert of Europe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	325. “Since liberty has failed,” cries the advanced thought of Europe, “let us try liberty cum equality or, since
	the two are a little hard to pair, equality instead of liberty.
	For brotherhood, it is impossible; therefore we will replace it by industrial association.”
	But this time also, I think, God will not be deceived.
</p>
<p class="P">
	326. India had three fortresses of a communal life, the village community, the larger joint family and the orders of
	the Sannyasins; all these are broken or breaking with the stride of egoistic conceptions of social life; but is not
	this after all only the breaking of these imperfect moulds on the way to a larger and diviner communism?
</p>
<p class="P">
	327. The individual cannot be perfect until he has surrendered all he now calls himself to the divine Being.
	So also, until mankind gives all it has to God, never shall there be a perfected society.
</p>
<p class="P">
	328. There is nothing small in God's eyes; let there be nothing small in thine.
	He bestows as much labour of divine energy on the formation of a shell as on the building of an empire.
	For thyself it is greater to be a good shoemaker than a luxurious and incompetent king.
</p>
<p class="P">
	329. Imperfect capacity and effect in the work that is meant for thee is better than an artificial competency and a

	Affirm free nationality first, if thou wouldst ever bring the world to be one nation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	332. A nation is not made by a common blood, a common tongue or a common religion; these are only important helps
	and powerful conveniences.
	But wherever communities of men not bound by family ties are united in one sentiment and aspiration to defend a
	common inheritance from their ancestors or assure a common future for their posterity, there a nation is already in
	existence.
</p>
<p class="P">
	333. Nationality is a stride of the progressive God passing beyond the stage of the family; therefore the attachment
	to clan and tribe must weaken or perish before a nation can be born.
</p>
<p class="P">
	334. Family, nationality, humanity are Vishnu's three strides from an isolated to a collective unity.
	The first has been fulfilled, we yet strive for the perfection of the second, towards the third we are reaching out
	our hands and the pioneer work is already attempted.
</p>
<p class="P">
	335. With the present morality of the human race a sound and durable human unity is not yet possible; but there is
	no reason why a temporary approximation to it should not be the reward of strenuous aspiration and untiring effort.
	By constant approximations and by partial realisations and temporary successes Nature advances.

	When Rama the Avatar murdered Vali or Krishna, who was God himself, assassinated, to liberate his nation, his tyrant

	But this we can feel, that they acted divinely.

	339. Reaction perfects and hastens progress by increasing and purifying the force within it.
	This is what the multitude of the weak cannot see who despair of their port when the ship is fleeing helplessly

</p>
<p class="P">
	340. Democracy was the protest of the human soul against the allied despotisms of autocrat, priest and noble;
	Socialism is the protest of the human soul against the despotism of a plutocratic democracy; Anarchism is likely to
	be the protest of the human soul against the tyranny of a bureaucratic Socialism.
	A turbulent and eager march from illusion to illusion and from failure to failure is the image of European progress.
</p>
<p class="P">
	341. Democracy in Europe is the rule of the Cabinet minister, the corrupt deputy or the self-seeking capitalist
	masqued by the occasional sovereignty of a wavering populace; Socialism in Europe is likely to be the rule of the
	official and policeman masqued by the theoretic sovereignty of an abstract State.
	It is chimerical to enquire which is the better system; it would be difficult to decide which is the worse.
</p>
<p class="P">
	342. The gain of democracy is the security of the individual's life, liberty and goods from the caprices of the
	tyrant one or the selfish few; its evil is the decline of greatness in humanity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 469</p>
<p class="P">
	343. This erring race of human beings dreams always of perfecting their environment by the machinery of government

	What thou art within, that outside thee thou shalt enjoy; no machinery can rescue thee from the law of thy being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	344. Be always vigilant against thy human proneness to persecute or ignore the reality even while thou art
	worshipping its semblance or token.
	Not human wickedness but human fallibility is the opportunity of Evil.
</p>
<p class="P">
	345. Honour the garb of the ascetic, but look also at the wearer, lest hypocrisy occupy the holy places and inward
	saintliness become a legend.
</p>
<p class="P">
	346. The many strive after competence or riches, the few embrace poverty as a bride; but, for thyself, strive after
	and embrace God only.
	Let Him choose for thee a king's palace or the bowl of the beggar.

<p class="P">
	347. What is vice but an enslaving habit and virtue but a human opinion?
	See God and do His will; walk in whatever path He shall trace for thy goings.
</p>
<p class="P">
	348. In the world's conflicts espouse not the party of the rich for their riches, nor of the poor for their poverty,
	of the king for his power and majesty, nor of the people for their hope and fervour, but be on God's side always.
	Unless indeed He has commanded thee to war against Him! then do that with thy whole heart and strength and rapture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	349. How shall I know God's will with me?
	I have to put egoism out of me, hunting it from every lair and burrow, and bathe my purified and naked soul in His
	infinite workings; then He himself will reveal it to me.
</p>
<p class="P">
	350. Only the soul that is naked and unashamed, can be pure and innocent, even as Adam was in the primal garden of
	humanity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 470</p>
<p class="P">
	351. Boast not thy riches, neither seek men's praise for thy poverty and self-denial; both these things are the
	coarse or the fine food of egoism.
</p>
<p class="P">
	352. Altruism is good for man, but less good when it is a form of supreme self-indulgence and lives by pampering the
	selfishness of others.
</p>
<p class="P">
	353. By altruism thou canst save thy soul, but see that thou save it not by indulging in his perdition thy brother.
</p>
<p class="P">
	354. Self-denial is a mighty instrument for purification; it is not an end in itself nor a final law of living.
	Not to mortify thyself but to satisfy God in the world must be thy object.
</p>
<p class="P">
	355. It is easy to distinguish the evil worked by sin and vice, but the trained eye sees also the evil done by
	self-righteous or self-regarding virtue.
</p>
<p class="P">
	356. The Brahmin first ruled by the book and the ritual, the Kshatriya next by the sword and the buckler; now the
	Vaishya governs us by machinery and the dollar, and the Sudra, the liberated serf, presses in with his doctrine of
	the kingdom of associated labour.
	But neither priest, king, merchant nor labourer is the true governor of humanity; the despotism of the tool and the
	mattock will fail like all the preceding despotisms.
	Only when egoism dies and God in man governs his own human universality, can this earth support a happy and
	contented race of beings.
</p>
<p class="P">
	357. Men run after pleasure and clasp feverishly that burning bride to their tormented bosoms; meanwhile a divine
	and faultless bliss stands behind them waiting to be seen and claimed and captured.
</p>
<p class="P">
	358. Men hunt after petty successes and trivial masteries from which they fall back into exhaustion and weakness;
	meanwhile all the infinite force of God in the universe waits vainly to place itself at their disposal.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 471</p>
<p class="P">

	meanwhile all infinite wisdom laughs above their heads and shakes wide the glory of her iridescent pinions.
</p>
<p class="P">
	360. Men seek laboriously to satisfy and complement the little bounded being made of the mental impressions they
	have grouped about a mean and grovelling ego; meanwhile the spaceless and timeless Soul is denied its joyous and
	splendid manifestation.
</p>
<p class="P">
	361. O soul of India, hide thyself no longer with the darkened Pandits of the Kaliyuga in the kitchen and the
	chapel, veil not thyself with the soulless rite, the obsolete law and the unblessed money of the dakshina; but seek
	in thy soul, ask of God and recover thy true Brahminhood and Kshatriya-hood with the eternal Veda; restore the
	hidden truth of the Vedic sacrifice, return to the fulfilment of an older and mightier Vedanta.
</p>
<p class="P">
	362. Limit not sacrifice to the giving up of earthly goods or the denial of some desires and yearnings, but let
	every thought and every work and every enjoyment be an offering to God within thee.
	Let thy steps walk in thy Lord, let thy sleep and waking be a sacrifice to Krishna.
</p>
<p class="P">
	363. This is not according to my Shastra or my Science, say the men of rule, formalists.
	Fool! is God then only a book that there should be nothing true and good except what is written?
</p>
<p class="P">
	364. By which standard shall I walk, the word that God speaks to me, saying “This is My will, O my servant,” or the
	rules that men who are dead, have written?
	Nay, if I have to fear and obey any, I will fear and obey God rather and not the pages of a book or the frown of a
	Pandit.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 472</p>
<p class="P">
	365. Thou mayst be deceived, wilt thou say, it may not be God's voice leading thee?
	Yet do I know that He abandons not those who have trusted Him even ignorantly, yet have I found that He leads wisely
	and lovingly even when He seems to deceive utterly, yet would I rather fall into the snare of the living God than be
	saved by trust in a dead formulary.
</p>
<p class="P">
	366. Act according to the Shastra rather than thy self-will and desire; so shalt thou grow stronger to control the
	ravener in thee; but act according to God rather than the Shastra; so shalt thou reach to His highest which is far
	above rule and limit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	367. The Law is for the bound and those whose eyes are sealed; if they walk not by it, they will stumble; but thou
	who art free in Krishna or hast seen his living light, walk holding the hand of thy Friend and by the lamp of
	eternal Veda.
</p>
<p class="P">
	368. The Vedanta is God's lamp to lead thee out of this night of bondage and egoism; but when the light of Veda has
	dawned in thy soul, then even that divine lamp thou needest not, for now thou canst walk freely and surely in a high
	and eternal sunlight.
</p>
<p class="P">
	369. What is the use of only knowing?
	I say to thee, Act and be, for therefore God sent thee into this human body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	370. What is the use of only being?
	I say to thee, Become, for therefore wast thou established as a man in this world of matter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	371. The path of works is in a way the most difficult side of God's triune causeway; yet is it not also, in this
	material world at least, the easiest, widest and most delightful?
	For at every moment we clash against God the worker and grow into His being by a thousand divine touches.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 473</p>
<p class="P">
	372. This is the wonder of the way of works that even enmity to God can be made an agency of salvation.
	Sometimes God draws and attaches us most swiftly to Him by wrestling with us as our fierce, invincible and
	irreconcilable enemy.
</p>
<p class="P">
	373. Shall I accept death or shall I turn and wrestle with him and conquer?
	That shall be as God in me chooses.
	For whether I live or die, I am always.
</p>
<p class="P">
	374. What is this thing thou callest death?
	Can God die?
	O thou who fearest death, it is Life that has come to thee sporting with a death-head and wearing a mask of terror.
</p>
<p class="P">
	375. There is a means to attain physical immortality and death is by our choice, not by Nature's compulsion.
	But who would care to wear one coat for a hundred years or be confined in one narrow and changeless lodging unto a
	long eternity?
</p>
<p class="P">
	376. Fear and anxiety are perverse forms of will.
	What thou fearest and ponderest over, striking that note repeatedly in thy mind, thou helpest to bring about; for,
	if thy will above the surface of waking repels it, it is yet what thy mind underneath is all along willing, and the
	subconscious mind is mightier, wider, better equipped to fulfil than thy waking force and intellect.
	But the spirit is stronger than both together; from fear and hope take refuge in the grandiose calm and careless
	mastery of the spirit.
</p>
<p class="P">
	377. God made the infinite world by Self-knowledge which in its works is Will-Force self-fulfilling.
	He used ignorance to limit His infinity; but fear, weariness, depression, self-distrust and assent to weakness are
	the instruments by which He destroys what He created.
	When these things are turned on what is evil or harmful and ill-regulated within thee, then it is well; but if they
	attack thy very sources of life and strength, then seize and expel them or thou diest.
</p>
<p class="P">
	378. Mankind has used two powerful weapons to destroy its own powers and enjoyment, wrong indulgence and wrong
	abstinence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 474</p>
<p class="P">
	379. Our mistake has been and is always to flee from the ills of Paganism to asceticism as a remedy and from the
	ills of asceticism back to Paganism.
	We swing for ever between two false opposites.
</p>
<p class="P">
	380. It is well not to be too loosely playful in one's games or too grimly serious in one's life and works.
	We seek in both a playful freedom and a serious order.
</p>
<p class="P">
	381. For nearly forty years I believed them when they said I was weakly in constitution, suffered constantly from
	the smaller and the greater ailments and mistook this curse for a burden that Nature had laid upon me.
	When I renounced the aid of medicines, then they began to depart from me like disappointed parasites.
	Then only I understood what a mighty force was the natural health within me and how much mightier yet the Will and
	Faith exceeding mind which God meant to be the divine support of our life in this body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	382. Machinery is necessary to modern humanity because of our incurable barbarism.
	If we must incase ourselves in a bewildering multitude of comforts and trappings, we must needs do without Art and
	its methods; for to dispense with simplicity and freedom is to dispense with beauty.
	The luxury of our ancestors was rich and even gorgeous, but never encumbered.
</p>
<p class="P">
	383. I cannot give to the barbarous comfort and encumbered ostentation of European life the name of civilisation.
	Men who are not free in their souls and nobly rhythmical in their appointments, are not civilised.
</p>
<p class="P">
	384. Art in modern times and under European influence has become an excrescence upon life or an unnecessary menial;
	it should have been its chief steward and indispensable arranger.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 475</p>
<p class="P">
	385. Disease is needlessly prolonged and ends in death oftener than is inevitable, because the mind of the patient
	supports and dwells upon the disease of his body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	386. Medical Science has been more a curse to mankind than a blessing.
	It has broken the force of epidemics and unveiled a marvellous surgery; but, also, it has weakened the natural
	health of man and multiplied individual diseases; it has implanted fear and dependence in the mind and body; it has
	taught our health to repose not on natural soundness but a rickety and distasteful crutch compact from the mineral
	and vegetable kingdoms.
</p>
<p class="P">
	387. The doctor aims a drug at a disease; sometimes it hits, sometimes misses.
	The misses are left out of account, the hits treasured up, reckoned and systematised into a science.
</p>
<p class="P">
	388. We laugh at the savage for his faith in the medicine man; but how are the civilised less superstitious who have
	faith in the doctors?
	The savage finds that when a certain incantation is repeated, he often recovers from a certain disease; he believes.
	The civilised patient finds that when he doses himself according to a certain prescription, he often recovers from a
	certain disease; he believes.
	Where is the difference?
</p>
<p class="P">
	389. The north-country Indian herdsman, attacked by fever, sits in the chill stream of a river for an hour or more
	and rises up free and healthy.
	If the educated man did the same, he would perish, not because the same remedy in its nature kills one and cures
	another, but because our bodies have been fatally indoctrinated by the mind into false habits.
</p>
<p class="P">
	390. It is not the medicine that cures so much as the patient's faith in the doctor and the medicine.
	Both are a clumsy substitute for the natural faith in one's own self-power which they have themselves destroyed.
</p>
<p class="P">
	391. The healthiest ages of mankind were those in which there were the fewest material remedies.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 476</p>
<p class="P">
	392. The most robust and healthy race left on earth were the African savages; but how long can they so remain after
	their physical consciousness has been contaminated by the mental aberrations of the civilised?
</p>
<p class="P">
	393. We ought to use the divine health in us to cure and prevent diseases; but Galen and Hippocrates and their tribe
	have given us instead an armoury of drugs and a barbarous Latin hocuspocus as our physical gospel.
</p>
<p class="P">
	394. Medical Science is well-meaning and its practitioners often benevolent and not seldom self-sacrificing; but
	when did the well-meaning of the ignorant save them from harm-doing?
</p>
<p class="P">
	395. If all remedies were really and in themselves efficacious and all medical theories sound, how would that
	console us for our lost natural health and vitality?
	The upas-tree is sound in all its parts, but it is still an upas-tree.
</p>
<p class="P">
	396. The spirit within us is the only all-efficient doctor and submission of the body to it the one true panacea.
</p>
<p class="P">
	397. God within is infinite and self-fulfilling Will.
	Unappalled by the fear of death, canst thou leave to Him, not as an experiment, with a calm and entire faith thy
	ailments?
	Thou shalt find in the end that He exceeds the skill of a million doctors.
</p>
<p class="P">
	398. Health protected by twenty thousand precautions is the gospel of the doctor; but it is not God's evangel for
	the body, nor Nature's.
</p>
<p class="P">
	399. Man was once naturally healthy and could revert to that primal condition if he were suffered; but Medical
	Science pursues our body with an innumerable pack of drugs and assails the imagination with ravening hordes of
	microbes.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 477</p>

</p>
<p class="P">
	401. Surgeons save and cure by cutting and maiming.
	Why not rather seek to discover Nature's direct all-powerful remedies?
</p>
<p class="P">
	402. It should take long for self-cure to replace medicine, because of the fear, self-distrust and unnatural
	physical reliance on drugs which Medical Science has taught to our minds and bodies and made our second nature.
</p>
<p class="P">
	403. Medicine is necessary for our bodies in disease only because our bodies have learned the art of not getting
	well without medicines.
	Even so, one sees often that the moment Nature chooses for recovery is that in which the life is abandoned as
	hopeless by the doctors.
</p>
<p class="P">
	404. Distrust of the curative power within us was our physical fall from Paradise.
	Medical Science and a bad heredity are the two angels of God who stand at the gates to forbid our return and
	reentry.
</p>
<p class="P">
	405. Medical Science to the human body is like a great Power which enfeebles a smaller State by its protection or
	like a benevolent robber who knocks his victim flat and riddles him with wounds in order that he may devote his life
	to healing and serving the shattered body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	406. Drugs often cure the body when they do not merely trouble or poison it, but only if their physical attack on
	the disease is supported by the force of the spirit; if that force can be made to work freely, drugs are at once
	superfluous.

<p class="P">
	407. I am not a Bhakta, for I have not renounced the world for God.
	How can I renounce what He took from me by force and gave back to me against my will?
	These things are too hard for me.
</p>
<p class="P">
	408. I am not a Bhakta, I am not a Jnani, I am not a worker for the Lord.
	What am I then?
	A tool in the hands of my Master, a flute blown upon by the divine Herd-Boy, a leaf driven by the breath of the
	Lord.
</p>
<p class="P">
	409. Devotion is not utterly fulfilled till it becomes action and knowledge.
	If thou pursuest after God and canst overtake Him, let Him not go till thou hast His reality.
	If thou hast hold of His reality, insist on having also His totality.
	The first will give thee<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="149" href="#">1</a> divine knowledge, the second will give thee<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="150" href="#">2</a> divine works and a free and perfect joy in the universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	410. Others boast of their love for God.
	My boast is that I did not love God; it was He who loved me and sought me out and forced me to belong to Him.
</p>
<p class="P">
	411. After I knew that God was a woman, I learned something from far-off about love; but it was only when I became a
	woman and served my Master and Paramour that I knew love utterly.
</p>
<p class="P">
	412. To commit adultery with God is the perfect experience for which the world was created.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 482</p>
<p class="P">
	413. To fear God really is to remove oneself to a distance from Him, but to fear Him in play gives an edge to utter
	delightfulness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	414. The Jew invented the God-fearing man; India the God-knower and God-lover.
</p>
<p class="P">
	415. The servant of God was born in Judaea, but he came to maturity among the Arabs.
	India's joy is in the servant-lover.
</p>
<p class="P">
	416. Perfect love casts out fear; but still keep thou some tender shadow and memory of the exile and it will make
	the perfection more perfect.
</p>
<p class="P">
	417. Thy soul has not tasted God's entire delight, if it has never had the joy of being His enemy, opposing His
	designs and engaging with Him in mortal combat.
</p>
<p class="P">
	418. If you cannot make God love you, make Him fight you.
	If He will not give you the embrace of the lover, compel Him to give you the embrace of the wrestler.
</p>
<p class="P">
	419. My soul is the captive of God, taken by Him in battle; it still remembers the war, though so far from it, with
	delight and alarm and wonder.
</p>
<p class="P">
	420. Most of all things on earth I hated pain till God hurt and tortured me; then it was revealed to me that pain is
	only a perverse and recalcitrant shape of excessive delight.
</p>
<p class="P">
	421. There are four stages in the pain God gives to us; when it is only pain; when it is pain that causes pleasure;
	when it is pain that is pleasure; and when it is purely a fiercer form of delight.
</p>
<p class="P">
	422. Even when one has climbed up into those levels of bliss where pain vanishes, it still survives disguised as
	intolerable ecstasy.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 483</p>
<p class="P">
	423. When I was mounting upon ever higher crests of His joy, I asked myself whether there was no limit to the
	increase of bliss and almost I grew afraid of God's embraces.
</p>
<p class="P">
	424. The next greatest rapture to the love of God, is the love of God in men; there, too, one has the joy of
	multiplicity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	425. For monogamy may be the best for the body, but the soul that loves God in men dwells here always as the
	boundless and ecstatic polygamist; yet all the time — that is the secret — it is in love with only one being.
</p>
<p class="P">
	426. The whole world is my seraglio and every living being and inanimate existence in it is the instrument of my
	rapture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	427. I did not know for some time whether I loved Krishna best or Kali; when I loved Kali, it was loving myself, but
	when I loved Krishna, I loved another, and still it was my Self with whom I was in love.
	Therefore I came to love Krishna better even than Kali.
</p>
<p class="P">
	428. What is the use of admiring Nature or worshipping her as a Power, a Presence and a goddess?
	What is the use, either, of appreciating her aesthetically or artistically?
	The secret is to enjoy her with the soul as one enjoys a woman with the body.
</p>
<p class="P">
	429. When one has the vision in the heart, everything, Nature and Thought and Action, ideas and occupations and
	tastes and objects become the Beloved and are a source of ecstasy.
</p>
<p class="P">
	430. The philosophers who reject the world as Maya, are very wise and austere and holy; but I cannot help thinking
	sometimes that they are also just a little stupid and allow God to cheat them too easily.
</p>
<p class="P">
	431. For my part, I think I have a right to insist on God giving Himself to me in the world as well as out of it.
	Why did He make it at all, if He wanted to escape that obligation?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 484</p>
<p class="P">
	432. The Mayavadin talks of my Personal God as a dream and prefers to dream of Impersonal Being; the Buddhist puts
	that aside too as a fiction and prefers to dream of Nirvana and the bliss of nothingness.
	Thus all the dreamers are busy reviling each other's visions and parading their own as the panacea.
	What the soul utterly rejoices in, is for thought the ultimate reality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	433. Beyond Personality the Mayavadin sees indefinable Existence; I followed him there and found my Krishna beyond
	in indefinable Personality.
</p>
<p class="P">
	434. When I first met Krishna, I loved Him as a friend and playmate till He deceived me; then I was indignant and
	could not forgive Him.
	Afterwards I loved Him as a lover and He still deceived me; I was again and much more indignant, but this time I had
	to pardon.
</p>
<p class="P">
	435. After offending, He forced me to pardon Him not by reparation, but by committing fresh offences.
</p>
<p class="P">
	436. So long as God tried to repair His offences against me, we went on periodically quarrelling; but when He found
	out His mistake, the quarrelling stopped, for I had to submit to Him entirely.
</p>
<p class="P">
	437. When I saw others than Krishna and myself in the world, I kept secret God's doings with me; but since I began
	to see Him and myself everywhere, I have become shameless and garrulous.
</p>
<p class="P">
	438. All that my Lover has, belongs to me.
	Why do you abuse me for showing off the ornaments He has given to me?
</p>
<p class="P">
	439. My Lover took His crown and royal necklace from His head and neck and clothed me with them; but the disciples
	of the saints and the prophets abused me and said, “He is hunting after siddhis.”
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 485</p>
<p class="P">
	440. I did my Lover's commands in the world and the will of my Captor; but they cried, “Who is this corruptor of
	youth, this disturber of morals?”
</p>
<p class="P">
	441. If I cared even for your praise, O ye saints, if I cherished my reputation, O ye prophets, my Lover would never
	have taken me into His bosom and given me the freedom of His secret chambers.
</p>
<p class="P">
	442. I was intoxicated with the rapture of my Lover and I threw the robe of the world from me even in the world's
	highways.
	Why should I care that the worldlings mock and the Pharisees turn their faces?
</p>
<p class="P">
	443. To thy lover, O Lord, the railing of the world is wild honey and the pelting of stones by the mob is summer
	rain on the body.
	For is it not Thou that railest and peltest, and is it not Thou in the stones that strikest and hurtest me?
</p>
<p class="P">
	444. There are two things in God which men call evil, that which they cannot understand at all and that which they
	misunderstand and, possessing, misuse; it is only what they grope after half-vainly and dimly understand that they
	call good and holy.
	But to me all things in Him are lovable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	445. They say, O my God, that I am mad because I see no fault in Thee; but if I am indeed mad with Thy love, I do
	not wish to recover my sanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	446. “Errors, falsehoods, stumblings!” they cry.
	How bright and beautiful are Thy errors, O Lord!
	Thy falsehoods save Truth alive; by Thy stumblings the world is perfected.
</p>
<p class="P">
	447. Life, Life, Life, I hear the passions cry; God, God, God, is the soul's answer.
	Unless thou seest and lovest Life as God only, then is Life itself a sealed joy to thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	448. “He loves her”, the senses say; but the soul says “God God God”.
	That is the all-embracing formula of existence.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 486</p>
<p class="P">
	449. If thou canst not love the vilest worm and the foulest of criminals, how canst thou believe that thou hast
	accepted God in thy spirit?
</p>
<p class="P">
	450. To love God, excluding the world, is to give Him an intense but imperfect adoration.
</p>
<p class="P">
	451. Is love only a daughter or handmaid of jealousy ?
	If Krishna loves Chandrabali, why should I not love her also?
</p>
<p class="P">
	452. Because thou lovest God only, thou art apt to claim that He should love thee rather than others; but this is a
	false claim contrary to right and the nature of things.
	For He is the One but thou art of the many.
	Rather become one in heart and soul with all beings, then there will be none in the world but thou alone for Him to
	love.
</p>
<p class="P">
	453. My quarrel is with those who are foolish enough not to love my Lover, not with those who share His love with
	me.
</p>
<p class="P">
	454. In those whom God loves, have delight; on those whom He pretends not to love, take pity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	455. Dost thou hate the atheist because he does love not God?
	Then shouldst<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="151" href="#">3</a> thou be disliked because thou dost not love-God
	perfectly.
</p>
<p class="P">
	456. There is one thing especially in which creeds and churches surrender themselves to the devil, and that is in
	their anathemas.
	When the priest chants Anathema Maranatha, then I see a devil worshipper praying.
</p>
<p class="P">
	457. No doubt, when the priest curses, he is crying to God; but it is the God of anger and darkness to whom he
	devotes himself along with his enemy; for as he approaches God, so shall God receive him.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 487</p>
<p class="P">
	458. I was much plagued by Satan, until I found that it was God who was tempting me; then the anguish of him passed
	out of my soul for ever.
</p>
<p class="P">
	459. I hated the devil and was sick with his temptations and tortures; and I could not tell why the voice in his
	departing words was so sweet that when he returned often and offered himself to me, it was with sorrow I refused
	him.
	Then I discovered it was Krishna at His tricks and my hate was changed into laughter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	460. They explained the evil in the world by saying that Satan had prevailed against God; but I think more proudly
	of my Beloved.
	I believe that nothing is done but by His will in heaven or hell, on earth or on the waters.
</p>
<p class="P">
	461. In our ignorance we are like children proud of our success in walking erect and unaided and too eager to be
	aware of the mother's steadying touch on the shoulder.
	When we wake, we look back and see that God was leading and upholding us always.
</p>
<p class="P">
	462. At first whenever I fell back into sin, I used to weep and rage against myself and against God for having
	suffered it.
	Afterwards it was as much as I could dare to ask, “Why hast thou rolled me again in the mud, O my playfellow?”
	Then even that came to my mind to seem too bold and presumptuous; I could only get up in silence, look at him out of
	the corner of my eyes — and clean myself.
</p>
<p class="P">
	463. God has so arranged life that the world is the soul's husband; Krishna its divine paramour.
	We owe a debt of service to the world and are bound to it by a law, a compelling opinion, and a common experience of
	pain and pleasure, but our heart's worship and our free and secret joy are for our Lover.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 488</p>
<p class="P">
	464. The joy of God is secret and wonderful; it is a mystery and a rapture at which common sense makes mouths of
	mockery; but the soul that has once tasted it, can never renounce, whatever worldly disrepute, torture and
	affliction it may bring us.
</p>
<p class="P">
	465. God, the world Guru, is wiser than thy mind; trust Him and not that eternal self-seeker and arrogant sceptic.
</p>
<p class="P">
	466. The sceptic mind doubts always because it cannot understand, but the faith of the God-lover persists in knowing
	although it cannot understand.
	Both are necessary to our darkness, but there can be no doubt which is the mightier.
	What I cannot understand now, I shall some day master, but if I lose faith and love, I fall utterly from the goal
	which God has set before me.
</p>
<p class="P">
	467. I may question God, my guide and teacher, and ask Him, “Am I right or hast Thou in thy love and wisdom suffered
	my mind to deceive me?”
	Doubt thy mind, if thou wilt, but doubt not that God leads thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	468. Because thou wert given at first imperfect conceptions about God, now thou ragest and deniest Him.
	Man, dost thou doubt thy teacher because he gave not thee the whole of knowledge at the beginning?
	Study rather that imperfect truth and put it in its place, so that thou mayst pass on safely to the wider knowledge
	that is now opening before thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	469. This is how God in His love teaches the child soul and the weakling, taking them step by step and withholding
	the vision of His ultimate and yet unattainable mountaintops.
	And have we not all some weakness?
	Are we not all in His sight but as little children?
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 489</p>
<p class="P">
	470. This I have seen that whatever God has withheld from me, He withheld in His love and wisdom.
	Had I grasped it then, I would have turned some great good into a great poison.
	Yet sometimes when we insist, He gives us poison to drink that we may learn to turn from it and taste with knowledge
	His ambrosia and His nectar.
</p>
<p class="P">
	471. Even the atheist ought now to be able to see that creation marches towards some infinite and mighty purpose
	which evolution in its very nature supposes.
	But infinite purpose and fulfilment presupposes an infinite wisdom that prepares, guides, shapes, protects and
	justifies.
	Revere then that Wisdom and worship it with thoughts in thy soul if not with incense in a temple, and even though
	thou deny it the heart of infinite Love and the mind of infinite self-effulgence.
	Then though thou know it not it is still Krishna whom thou reverest and worshippest.
</p>
<p class="P">
	472. The Lord of Love has said, “They who follow after the Unknowable and Indefinable, follow after Me and I accept
	them.”
	He has justified by His word the Illusionist and the Agnostic.
	Why then, O devotee, dost thou rail at him whom thy Master has accepted?
</p>
<p class="P">
	473. Calvin who justified eternal Hell, knew not God but made one terrible mask of Him His eternal reality.
	If there were an unending Hell, it could only be a seat of unending rapture; for God is Ananda and than the eternity
	of His bliss there is no other eternity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	474. Dante, when he said that God's perfect love created eternal Hell, wrote perhaps wiselier than he knew; for from
	stray glimpses I have sometimes thought there is a Hell where our souls suffer aeons of intolerable ecstasy and
	wallow as if for ever in the utter embrace of Rudra, the sweet and terrible.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 490</p>
<p class="P">
	475. Discipleship to God the Teacher, sonship to God the Father, tenderness of God the Mother, clasp of the hand of
	the divine Friend, laughter and sport with our Comrade and boy Playfellow, blissful servitude to God the Master,
	rapturous love of our divine Paramour, these are the seven beatitudes of life in the human body.
	Canst thou unite all these in a single supreme and rainbow-hued relation?
	Then hast thou no need of any heaven and thou exceedest the emancipation of the Adwaitin.
</p>
<p class="P">
	476. When will the world change into the model of heaven?
	When all mankind becomes boys and girls together with God revealed as Krishna and Kali, the happiest boy and
	strongest girl of the crowd, playing together in the gardens of Paradise.
	The Semitic Eden was well enough, but Adam and Eve were too grown up and its God himself too old and stern and
	solemn for the offer of the Serpent to be resisted.
</p>
<p class="P">
	477. The Semites have afflicted mankind with the conception of a God who is a stern and dignified king and solemn
	judge and knows not mirth.
	But we who have seen Krishna, know Him for a boy fond of play and a child full of mischief and happy laughter.
</p>
<p class="P">
	478. A God who cannot smile, could not have created this humorous universe.
</p>
<p class="P">
	479. God took a child to fondle him in His bosom of delight; but the mother wept and would not be consoled because
	her child no longer existed.
</p>
<p class="P">
	480. When I suffer from pain or grief or mischance, I say “So, my old Playfellow, thou hast taken again to bullying
	me,” and I sit down to possess the pleasure of the pain, the joy of the grief, the good fortune of the mischance;
	then He sees He is found out and takes His ghosts and bugbears away from me.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 491</p>
<p class="P">
	481. The seeker after divine knowledge finds in the description of Krishna stealing the robes of the Gopis one of
	the deepest parables of God's ways with the soul, the devotee a perfect rendering in divine act of his heart's
	mystic experiences, the prurient and the Puritan (two faces of one temperament) only a lustful story.
	Men bring what they have in themselves and see it reflected in the Scripture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	482. My lover took away my robe of sin and I let it fall, rejoicing; then he plucked at my robe of virtue, but I was
	ashamed and alarmed and prevented him.
	It was not till he wrested it from me by force that I saw how my soul had been hidden from me.
</p>
<p class="P">
	483. Sin is a trick and a disguise of Krishna to conceal Himself from the gaze of the virtuous.
	Behold, O Pharisee, God in the sinner, sin in thy self purifying thy heart; clasp thy brother.
</p>
<p class="P">
	484. Love of God, charity towards men is the first step towards perfect wisdom.
</p>
<p class="P">
	485. He who condemns failure and imperfection, is condemning God; he limits his own soul and cheats his own vision.
	Condemn not, but observe Nature, help and heal thy brothers and strengthen by sympathy their capacities and their
	courage.
</p>
<p class="P">
	486. Love of man, love of woman, love of things, love of thy neighbour, love of thy country, love of animals, love
	of humanity are all the love of God reflected in these living images.
	So love and grow mighty to enjoy all, to help all and to love for ever.
</p>
<p class="P">
	487. If there are things that absolutely refuse to be transformed or remedied into God's more perfect image, they
	may be destroyed with tenderness in the heart, but ruthlessness in the smiting.
	But make sure first that God has given thee thy sword and thy mission.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 492</p>
<p class="P">
	488. I should love my neighbour not because he is neighbourhood, — for what is there in neighbourhood and distance?
	nor because the religions tell me he is my brother, — for where is the root of that brotherhood? but because he is
	myself.
	Neighbourhood and distance affect the body, the heart goes beyond them.
	Brotherhood is of blood or country or religion or humanity, but when self-interest clamours what becomes of this
	brotherhood?
	It is only by living in God and turning mind and heart and body into the image of his universal unity that that
	deep, disinterested and unassailable love becomes possible.
</p>
<p class="P">
	489. When I live in Krishna, then ego and self-interest vanish and only God himself can qualify my love bottomless
	and illimitable.
</p>
<p class="P">
	490. Living in Krishna, even enmity becomes a play of love and the wrestling of brothers.
</p>
<p class="P">
	491. To the soul that has hold of the highest beatitude, life cannot be an evil or a sorrowful illusion; rather all
	life becomes the rippling love and laughter of a divine Lover and Playfellow.
</p>
<p class="P">
	492. Canst thou see God as the bodiless Infinite and yet love Him as a man loves his mistress?
	Then has the highest truth of the Infinite been revealed to thee.
	Canst thou also clothe the Infinite in one secret embraceable body and see Him seated in each and all of these
	bodies that are visible and sensible?
	Then has its widest and profoundest truth come also into thy possession.
</p>
<p class="P">
	493. Divine Love has simultaneously a double play, an universal movement, deep, calm and bottomless like the nether
	Ocean, which broods upon the whole world and each thing that is in it as upon a level bed with an equal pressure,
	and a personal movement, forceful, intense and ecstatic like the dancing surface of the same Ocean, which varies the
	height and force of its billows and chooses the objects it shall fall upon with the kiss of its foam and spray and
	the clasp of its engulfing waters.
</p>
<p class="P">
	494. I used to hate and avoid pain and resent its infliction; but now I find that had I not so suffered, I would not
	now possess, trained and perfected, this infinitely and multitudinously sensible capacity of delight in my mind,
	heart and body.
	God justifies himself in the end even when He has masked Himself as a bully and a tyrant.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 493</p>
<p class="P">
	495. I swore that I would not suffer from the world's grief and the world's stupidity and cruelty and injustice and
	I made my heart as hard in endurance as the nether millstone and my mind as a polished surface of steel.
	I no longer suffered, but enjoyment had passed away from me.
	Then God broke my heart and ploughed up my mind.
	I rose through cruel and incessant anguish to a blissful painlessness and through sorrow and indignation and revolt
	to an infinite knowledge and a settled peace.
</p>
<p class="P">
	496. When I found that pain was the reverse side and the training of delight, I sought to heap blows on myself and
	multiply suffering in all my members; for even God's tortures seemed to me slow and slight and inefficient.
	Then my Lover had to stay my hand and cry, “Cease; for my stripes are enough for thee.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	497. The self-torture of the old monks and penitents was perverse and stupid; yet was there a secret soul of
	knowledge behind their perversities.
</p>
<p class="P">
	498. God is our wise and perfect Friend; because he knows when to smite as well as when to fondle, when to slay us
	no less than when to save and to succour.
</p>
<p class="P">
	499. The divine Friend of all creatures conceals His friendliness in the mask of an enemy till He has made us ready
	for the highest heavens; then, as in Kurukshetra, the terrible form of the Master of strife, suffering and
	destruction is withdrawn and the sweet face, the tender arm, the oft-clasped body of Krishna shine out on the shaken
	soul and purified eyes of his eternal comrade and playmate.
</p>
<p class="P">
	500. Suffering makes us capable of the full force of the Master of Delight; it makes us capable also to bear the
	utter play of the Master of Power.
	Pain is the key that opens the gates of strength; it is the high-road that leads to the city of beatitude.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 494</p>
<p class="P">
	501. Yet, O soul of man, seek not after pain, for that is not His will, seek after His joy only; as for suffering,
	it will come to thee surely in His providence as often and as much as is needed for thee.
	Then bear it that thou mayst find out at last its heart of rapture.
</p>
<p class="P">
	502. Neither do thou inflict pain, O man, on thy fellow; God alone has the right to inflict pain; or those have it
	whom He has commissioned.
	But deem not fanatically, as did Torquemada, that thou art one of these.
</p>
<p class="P">
	503. In former times there was a noble form of asseveration for souls compact merely of force and action, “As surely
	as God liveth.”
	But for our modern needs another asseveration would suit better, “As surely as God loveth.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	504. Science is chiefly useful to the God-lover and the God-knower because it enables him to understand in detail
	and admire the curious wonders of His material workmanship.
	The one learns and cries, “Behold how the Spirit has manifested itself in matter”; the other, “Behold, the touch of
	my Lover and Master, the perfect Artist, the hand omnipotent.”
</p>
<p class="P">
	505. O Aristophanes of the universe, thou who watchest thy world and laughest sweetly to thyself, wilt thou not let
	me too see with divine eyes and share in thy worldwide laughters?
</p>
<p class="P">
	506. Kalidasa says in a daring image that the snow-rocks of Kailasa are Shiva's loud world-laughters piled up in
	utter whiteness and pureness on the mountaintops.
	It is true; and when their image falls on the heart, then the world's cares melt away like the clouds below into
	their real nothingness.
</p>
<p class="P">
	507. The strangest of the soul's experiences is this, that it finds, when it ceases to care for the image and threat
	of troubles, then the troubles themselves are nowhere to be found in one's neighbourhood.
	It is then that we hear from behind those unreal clouds God laughing at us.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 495</p>
<p class="P">
	508. Has thy effort succeeded, O thou Titan?
	Dost thou sit, like Ravana and Hiranyakashipou, served by the gods and the world's master?
	But that which thy soul was really hunting after, has escaped from thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	509. Ravana's mind thought it was hungering after universal sovereignty and victory over Rama; but the aim his soul
	kept its vision fixed upon all the time was to get back to its heaven as soon as possible and be again God's menial.
	Therefore, as the shortest way, it hurled itself against God in a furious clasp of enmity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	510. The greatest of joys is to be, like Naraka, the slave of God; the worst of Hells, being abandoned of God, to be
	the world's master.
	That which seems nearest to the ignorant conception of God, is the farthest from him.
</p>
<p class="P">
	511. God's servant is something; God's slave is greater.
</p>
<p class="P">
	512. To be master of the world would indeed be supreme felicity, if one were universally loved; but for that one
	would have to be at the same time the slave of all humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	513. After all when thou countest up thy long service to God, thou wilt find thy supreme work was the flawed and
	little good thou didst in love for humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	514. There are two works that are perfectly pleasing to God in his servant; to sweep in silent adoration His
	temple-floors and to fight in the world's battlefield for His divine consummation in humanity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	515. He who has done even a little good to human beings, though he be the worst of sinners, is accepted by God in
	the ranks of His lovers and servants.
	He shall look upon the face of the Eternal.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 496</p>
<p class="P">
	516. O fool of thy weakness, cover not God's face from thyself by a veil of awe, approach Him not with a suppliant
	weakness.
	Look! thou wilt see on His face not the solemnity of the King and Judge, but the smile of the Lover.
</p>
<p class="P">
	517. Until thou canst learn to grapple with God as a wrestler with his comrade, thy soul's strength shall always be
	hid from thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	518. Sumbha first loved Kali with his heart and body, then was furious with her and fought her, at last prevailed
	against her, seized her by the hair and whirled her thrice round him in the heavens; the next moment he was slain by
	her.
	These are the Titan's four strides to immortality and of them all the last is the longest and mightiest.
</p>
<p class="P">
	519. Kali is Krishna revealed as dreadful Power and wrathful Love.
	She slays with her furious blows the self in body, life and mind in order to liberate it as spirit eternal.
</p>
<p class="P">
	520. Our parents fell, in the deep Semitic apologue, because they tasted the fruit of the tree of good and evil.
	Had they taken at once of the tree of eternal life, they would have escaped the immediate consequence; but God's
	purpose in humanity would have been defeated.
	His wrath is our eternal advantage.
</p>
<p class="P">
	521. If Hell were possible, it would be the shortest cut to the highest heaven.
	For verily God loveth.
</p>
<p class="P">
	522. God drives us out [of] every Eden that we may be forced to travel through the desert to a diviner Paradise.
	If thou wonder why should that parched and fierce transit be necessary, then art thou befooled by thy mind and hast
	not studied thy soul behind and its dim desires and secret raptures.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 497</p>
<p class="P">
	523. A healthy mind hates pain; for the desire of pain that men sometimes develop in their minds is morbid and
	contrary to Nature.
	But the soul cares not for the mind and its sufferings any more than the iron-master for the pain of the ore in the
	furnace; it follows its own necessities and its own hunger.
</p>
<p class="P">
	524. Pity is sometimes a good substitute for love; but it is always no more than a substitute.
</p>
<p class="P">
	525. Self-pity is always born of self-love; but pity for others is not always born of love for its object.
	It is sometimes a self-regarding shrinking from the sight of pain; sometimes the rich man's contemptuous dole to the
	pauper.
	Develop rather God's divine compassion than human pity.
</p>
<p class="P">
	526. Not pity that bites the heart and weakens the inner members, but a divine masterful and untroubled compassion
	and helpfulness is the virtue that we should encourage.
</p>
<p class="P">
	527. To find that saving a man's body or mind from suffering is not always for the good of either soul, mind or
	body, is one of the bitterest of experiences for the humanly compassionate.
</p>
<p class="P">
	528. Human pity is born of ignorance and weakness; it is the slave of emotional impressions.
	Divine compassion understands, discerns and saves.
</p>
<p class="P">
	529. Indiscriminate compassion is the noblest gift of temperament, not to do even the least hurt to one living thing
	is the highest of all human virtues; but God practises neither.
	Is man therefore nobler and better than the All-loving?
</p>
<p class="P">
	530. Love and serve men, but beware lest thou desire their approbation.
	Obey rather God within thee.
</p>
<p class="P">
	531. Not to have heard the voice of God and His angels is the world's idea of sanity.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 498</p>
<p class="P">
	532. See God everywhere and be not frightened by masks.
	Believe that all falsehood is truth in the making or truth in the breaking, all failure an effectuality concealed,
	all weakness strength hiding itself from its own vision, all pain a secret and violent ecstasy.
	If thou believest firmly and unweariedly, in the end thou wilt see and experience the All-true, Almighty and
	All-blissful.
</p>
<p class="P">
	533. Human love fails by its own ecstasy, human strength is exhausted by its own effort, human knowledge throws a
	shadow that conceals half the globe of truth from its own sunlight; but divine knowledge embraces opposite truths
	and reconciles them, divine strength grows by the prodigality of its self-expenditure, divine love can squander
	itself utterly, yet never waste or diminish.
</p>
<p class="P">
	534. The rejection of falsehood by the mind seeking after truth is one of the chief causes why mind cannot attain to
	the settled, rounded and perfect truth; not to escape falsehood is the effort of divine mind, but to seize the truth
	which lies masked behind even the most grotesque or far-wandering error.
</p>
<p class="P">
	535. The whole truth about any object is a rounded and all-embracing globe which for ever circles around, but never
	touches the one and only subject and object of knowledge, God.
</p>
<p class="P">
	536. There are many profound truths which are like weapons dangerous to the unpractised wielder.
	Rightly handled, they are the most precious and potent in God's armoury.
</p>
<p class="P">
	537. The obstinate pertinacity with which we cling to our meagre, fragmentary, night-besieged and grief-besieged
	individual existence even while the unbroken bliss of our universal life calls to us, is one of the most amazing of
	God's mysteries.
	It is only equalled by the infinite blindness with which we cast a shadow of our ego over the whole world and call
	that the universal being.
	These two darknesses are the very essence and potency of Maya.
</p>
<p class="P">
	538. Atheism is the shadow or dark side of the highest perception of God.
	Every formula we frame about God, though always true as a symbol, becomes false when we accept it as a sufficient
	formula.
	The Atheist and Agnostic come to remind us of our error.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 499</p>
<p class="P">
	539. God's negations are as useful to us as His affirmations.
	It is He who as the Atheist denies His own existence for the better perfecting of human knowledge.
	It is not enough to see God in Christ and Ramakrishna and hear His words, we must see Him and hear Him also in
	Huxley and Haeckel.
</p>
<p class="P">
	540. Canst thou see God in thy torturer and slayer even in thy moment of death or thy hours of torture?
	Canst thou see Him in that which thou art slaying, see and love even while thou slayest?
	Thou hast thy hand on the supreme knowledge.
	How shall he attain to Krishna who has never worshipped Kali?

<h2 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">Hymn to the Mother of Radiances<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="152" href="#">1</a></h2>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">1</h4>
<p class="P">An inner fullness has come in like the coming in of light in dark caves. It fills, it illumines, it
	vibrates the multiple strings of life; it has found the contact with the forgotten achievements of the past to
	enable me to start the new ones of the future on the basis of the changing formations of the present. The currents
	of life well up to meet the descending rays of light from the upper heavens for transmutation of the base and the
	dark into the luminous and the true, for transmutation of the ugly and the wrong into the beautiful and the right.
</p>
<p class="P">O Mother of Radiances, you have dawned in the narrow horizons of my mind. Out of its depthless rigidities,
	in the midst of its walled-up spaces you have created a heart-like something that will live its eternal life. You
	have revealed to me a chamber alive and warm within the mind's substance-less polar regions and there I can safely
	retire and find in you my refuge.</p>
<p class="P">The lower network of moving forces remains, but I feel your presence in its midst. The higher network of
	moving forces remains, and here you have stepped in also shedding a warmth of life that was not there before, you
	have turned the dull grey luminosity into a brilliance of living waters. Your active and living presence is
	everywhere; you have heeded my words of aspiration, the fire of my demand for your omnipresence. More than what I
	ignorantly sought for, you have revealed to me. You are intimate and one with me when in truth and in law and yet
	away and far off from me when in error and in falsehood.</p>
<p class="P">When there are no more darkening shadows about me; when you see me bared of all shams and shows in every
	part of the being; when you see in every cell of my body an eternal home for you and an eternal temple; when you see
	me one with you in identity and still worshipping you; when you melt the compact gold of knowledge in the living and
	running waters of devotion; when you break my earth and release the energies; when you turn my pride into power in
	your hands and my ignorance into light, my narrowness into wideness, my selfishness into a true gathering together
	of forces in one centre, my greed into a capacity of untiring search after the truth for the attainment of its
	substances, my egoism into the true and conscious instrumental centre, my mind into a channel for you to descend, my
	heart into your hearth of pure fire and flame, my life into a pure and translucent substance for your handling, my
	body into a conscious vessel for holding what of you is meant for me; then, O Mother of Radiances, my aim in life
	now and hereafter will be fulfilled in the true and right and vast way. Aspiration wakes in me! Achieve in me all
	that I flame for!</p>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">2</h4>
<p class="P">Create in me a state of consciousness in which whatever I hear from you may at once turn into an intimate
	knowledge, a self-revelation, an expression of identity, an awareness at once of the within and the without. O
	Mother, whatever I gather from you, let it be of the deep vasts of the within which is omnipresent. May I be one
	with you in every way to have the supreme Delight, yet separate from you to stream forth devotion to you, one and
	yet separate like life and its movements, like heat and light, like power and its ex¬pression, like true knowledge
	and its effecting force. Let what you give me be not a treasure to me but as if a thing of my own self-discovered.
</p>
<p class="P">Wipe out the division in my consciousness that I may see and listen to you as part of yourself. The
	life-energies in me aspire for the knowledge that comes from identity, for the vision that is born of identity, for
	the listening that takes its orientation in identity, — the identity that is yourself.</p>
<p class="P">May I be the manifestation of a portion of you in your limitless and shining spaces.</p>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">3</h4>
<p class="P">Increase my fires of aspiration, make the surrender in me possible at once and in every way; widen my
	openness and receptivity; remove the coverings that delay the workings of the psyche deep within; take away, O
	Mother, from me what I have and what I have not</p>
<p class="P">The cells of my body, the filaments of my nervous coat, the five streams of my prana, the fires of my
	heart, the powers of my mind, — all make their unconditioned sur¬render to you, O Mother of Radiances, that there
	may not be falsehood in existence, division in consciousness, death in the living waters, want of harmony and misery
	in the nerve-coils, disease in the body...</p>
<p class="P">Thy voice replies to me:</p>
<p class="P">“By the fivefold powers of surrender in the physical, by the quiet intensity of the psychic urge that is
	behind you centrally, increase ever and ever the inherent Ananda and the hidden opulences of your consciousness.
	First of all, become conscious of what I have willed in you; be, next, that of which you have become conscious. Know
	at once and for ever,
	‘In me is your all.’”</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="note-on-the-texts">Notes on the Texts</h1>
<p class="P">ESSAYS DIVINE AND HUMAN consists of short prose pieces written by Sri Aurobindo between 1910 and the late
	1940s and not published before his passing in 1950. Most prose works written prior to 1910 on subjects other than
	politics are published in <em>Early Cultural Writings</em>, volume 1 of THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SRI AUROBINDO. Most
	short prose works written after 1910 and published during his lifetime are included in <em>Essays in Philosophy and
		Yoga</em>, volume 13 of THE COMPLETE WORKS. Short writings on the Vedas, the Upanishads and other specialised
	subjects are included in the volumes devoted to those subjects. Most of the writings in the present volume deal with
	philosophy, yoga, and yogic psychology. The contents have been divided into four parts:</p>
<p class="P">Part One.<em> Essays Divine and Human </em>More or less complete essays, most of which were given titles
	and revised to some extent by the author. They have been grouped by period in five sections.
</p>
<p class="P">Part Two. <em>From Man to Superman</em>. Notes, drafts and fragments on yoga and yogic philosophy and
	psychology. Few of these pieces were
	revised; most are incomplete, several quite fragmentary. The editors have arranged them by subject on lines
	explained below.
</p>
<p class="P">Part Three. <em>Notes and Fragments on Various Subjects</em>. Miscellaneous pieces that received little or
	no revision by the author. They
	differ from the pieces in Part Two in dealing with subjects not directly related to yoga, philosophy or psychology.
</p>
<p class="P">Part Four. <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em>. A series of aphorisms, revised but never prepared for
	publication by the author.
</p>
<h4 class="sub-hd" style="text-align:center">PART ONE: ESSAYS DIVINE AND HUMAN</h4>
<p class="pg-num">Page 504</p>
<p class="P">The pieces in this part have been arranged by the editors in five chronological sections. Many of the
	sections or subsections correspond to organic divisions in the author's work. </p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Section One </b>(circa 1911)</p>
<p class="P">All but the first piece in this section were written in a single notebook, probably in 1911. “Certitudes”
	belongs roughly to the same period. Above “Man” Sri Aurobindo wrote a collective title: “Essays —”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Certitudes</b>. Circa 1911-13. The Sanskrit phrase at the end, a citation from the Bhagavad Gita (4.11),
	means “as men approach me, so I accept them to my love”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Moksha</b>. Circa 1911.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Man</b>. Circa 1911. The Sanskrit phrase in the second paragraph, an altered citation from the Aitareya
	Upanishad (1.2.3), means “well-built, indeed”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Philosophy</b>. Circa 1911.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Siddhis</b>. Circa 1911.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Psychology of Yoga</b>. Circa 1911. Sri Aurobindo used this title again for a piece in Section Two
	that was written independently a year or two later and yet again as the general title of the first group of essays
	in Section Three.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Section Two</b> (1910-1913)</p>
<p class="P">Manuscripts of six of these essays — “The Sources of Poetry”, “The Interpretation of Scripture”, “On
	Original Thinking”, “The Balance of Justice”, “Social Reform” and “The Claims of Theosophy” — were typed in or
	around 1912 using the same typewriter and the same sort of paper. The other seven essays are related to the typed
	ones by subject or date or both.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Na Kinchidapi Chintayet</b>. Possibly early 1910. The title is a quotation from the Bhagavad Gita
	(6.25): “One should not think of anything at all.”</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Sources of Poetry</b>. Circa 1912.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Interpretation of Scripture</b>. Circa 1912.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 505</p>
<p class="P"><b>On Original Thinking. Circa </b>1912. After the text of the principal version, the editors have placed
	the draft opening of another version, entitled in the manuscript “On the Importance of Original Thinking”. Above
	this title Sri Aurobindo wrote: <br/> <br/> “Essays — Human and Divine”. The editors have used a variant of this
	(see “The Silence behind Life” below) as the title of this part and of the volume as a whole.</p>
<p class="P">This is a revised and enlarged version of “European Justice” (published in
	<em>Early Cultural Writings</em>), which probably was written in 1910.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Social Reform</b>. Circa 1912. The first nine paragraphs were typewritten. Sri Aurobindo subsequently
	added five handwritten paragraphs to the last typed sheet. (These paragraphs are difficult to read and parts have
	been lost through mutilation of the manuscript.) The passage beginning “We are Hindus”
	was written separately and headed “For ‘Social Reform’”. Sri Aurobindo left no indication where he wanted it
	inserted. The editors have placed it at the end, separating it from the main text by a white space.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Hinduism and the Mission of India</b>. Circa 1912. Editorial title. The first pages of the manuscript
	have been lost; the first surviving sentence lacks its beginning.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 506</p>
<p class="P" style="font-style:italic">Circa 1910-12 (certainly written after January 1908, when Sri Aurobindo met V. B. Lele, the “member of the
	Theosophical Society who [gave] me spiritual help” mentioned in paragraph six). This article, like the others on
	Theosophy, was never published by Sri Aurobindo. However much he disagreed with some of the methods or doctrines of
	the Theosophical Society, he was well aware of the pioneering work done by this movement, which “with its
	comprehensive combinations of old and new beliefs and its appeal to ancient spiritual and psychic systems, has
	everywhere exercised an influence far beyond the circle of its professed adherents” (<em>The Renaissance in
		India</em>, CWSA vol. 20, p.
		70). He assured a disciple who had been associated with the Theosophists: “I have nothing against it [the
	Theosophical Society] nor against any of the Theosophists, to all of whom I wish the best. I am not against them”
	(Talk with a disciple, 11 January 1926).</p>
<p class="P"><b>Science and Religion in Theosophy</b>. Circa 1910-12. Heading in the manuscript: “Papers on Theosophy /
	II / Science and Religion in Theosophy”. (Although not so identified, “The Claims of Theosophy” evidently is the
	first of the papers.)</p>
<p class="P"><b>Sat</b>. Circa 1912.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Sachchidananda</b>. Circa 1912-13.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Silence behind Life</b>. Circa 1912. Above the title Sri Aurobindo wrote: “Essays Divine and Human”.
	The editors have used this as the title of this part and of the volume as a whole.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Section Three </b>(circa 1913)</p>
<p class="P">The essays in this section form three groups, which were written in three notebooks in or around 1913. The
	titles of the first and third groups were given by Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Psychology of Yoga</b>. Sri Aurobindo wrote this title inside the cover of the notebook used. On the
	front of the cover he wrote, and then cancelled, “Hints on Yoga”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Initial Definitions and Descriptions</b>. Circa 1913. Before the first paragraph Sri Aurobindo wrote the
	numeral “1”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Object of Our Yoga</b>. Circa 1913. This essay is found in the notebook containing the pieces that
	make up the next group, but seems to go better here. It has no title in the manuscript.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Purna Yoga</b>. Editorial title. The three pieces are headed I, II, III in the manuscript.</p>
<p class="P"><b>I. The Entire Purpose of Yoga</b>. Circa 1913.</p>
<p class="P"><b>II. Parabrahman, Mukti and Human Thought-Systems</b>. Circa 1913.</p>
<p class="P"><b>III. Parabrahman and Parapurusha</b>. Circa 1913. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 507</p>
<p class="P"><b>Natural and Supernatural Man</b>. This title is written on the cover of the notebook that contains all
	the pieces in this group. The Evolutionary Aim in Yoga. Circa 1913. The Fullness of Yoga — In Condition. Circa 1913.
	A draft of this and the preceding essay is published as piece 127 of Part Two. The second part of the draft, from
	the phrase “Yoga in its practice may be either perfect or partial” to the end, was rewritten as <br/> <br/> “The
	Fullness of Yoga — In Condition”. This essay follows the draft rather closely for two and a half paragraphs; from
	this point the two are developed on different lines. The significance of the phrase “in condition” in the title is
	not made clear in the essay; but it is brought out sufficiently well in the draft.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Nature</b>. Circa 1913. This essay was at one point to be entitled “Maya, Lila, Prakriti, Chit-Shakti”.
	Individual pieces on each of these aspects of the force called Nature were apparently planned, but only “Maya” was
	written.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Maya</b>. Circa 1913. In the second paragraph Sri Aurobindo writes of his intention to “look at the
	Cosmos from . . . the stand point ... of... Lila”. Although never able to complete an essay on this theme, he did
	sketch his view of the subject in two sentences written on the back cover of the notebook. These sentences are given
	as a footnote.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Section Four </b>(1914-1919)</p>
<p class="P">The four essays making up this section were written independently during the period of publication of the
	monthly journal <em>Arya</em> (1914-21). They may have been meant for the journal, but were not published there.
	They have no relationship with each other except that of date.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Beginning and the End</b>. Circa 1915. Editorial title. In the manuscript this passage is followed
	by one that was published in the <em>Arya</em> in May 1915 under the title “<em>Thoughts and Glimpses</em>”.
	Subsequently this second passage was reproduced as three parts of the booklet Thoughts and Glimpses (published in
	<em>Essays in Philosophy and yoga</em>).</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Hour of God</b>. Circa 1918.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Beyond Good and Evil</b>. Circa 1918. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Divine Superman</b>. Circa 1918.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Section Five </b>(1927 and after)</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 508</p>
<p class="P">The second, third and fourth essays in this section were written in the same notebook around 1930. The
	other two were written at roughly the same time.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Law of the Way</b>. Circa 1927. The manuscript is untitled; the editors have used a phrase from the
	last sentence as heading.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Man and the Supermind</b>. Circa 1930. Sri Aurobindo returned to the theme “Man is a transitional being”
	again and again. See pieces 46, 47, 53, 54, 77, 80, 81 and 82 of Part Two. The present essay is the last of several
	drafts.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Involved and Evolving Godhead</b>. Circa 1930. Written immediately after the preceding essay in the
	same notebook. An earlier draft, written around 1927, is published as piece 51 of Part Two. The Evolution of
	Consciousness. Circa 1930. Untitled in the manuscript. The Greek sentence at the end of the third paragraph means
	“God is not but becomes.”</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Path</b>. Circa 1930. This essay is one of several pieces written around 1930 on the supramental
	yoga. Three others are published as pieces 18, 157 and 159 of Part Two.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center">PART TWO: FROM MAN TO SUPERMAN</p>
<p class="P">The 171 notes, drafts and fragments that make up this part were written by Sri Aurobindo over the course of
	thirty-five years, from around 1912 to 1947, when failing eyesight obliged him to stop writing by hand.</p>
<p class="P">None of the pieces were revised for publication by the author. It has sometimes been necessary for the
	editors to make judgments as to what his intentions were. In addition, some of the pieces, particularly those from
	the 1940s, are quite difficult to read. The editors have been able to decipher all but a few words; doubtful
	readings and illegible words are indicated in accordance with the Guide to Editorial Notation. Special problems are
	discussed in the reference volume.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 509</p>
<p class="P">These 171 pieces were never intended to form a single work. The compilation, arrangement and numbering is
	the responsibility of the editors. They have chosen to arrange the pieces by subject rather than date because a
	strict chronological arrangement, even if possible, would have resulted in thematic in <br/> <br/> coherence. A
	table in the reference volume shows the approximate chronological sequence of the pieces.</p>
<p class="P">The material falls into three broad categories, which have been made the main sections of the compilation:
	philosophy (the principles of things), psychology (the study of consciousness), and yoga. The pieces in each section
	have been divided into subsections and sub-subsections.</p>
<p class="P">A number of the pieces have headings in the manuscript. Some apparently were intended to be the titles of
	the essays or books that the pieces would have introduced. Since Sri Aurobindo frequently abandoned the pieces
	before the subject given in the title was reached, all headings have been omitted from the texts. They are given in
	the notes on individual pieces below. Some headings have been made the titles of subdivisions. One heading used
	twice by Sri Aurobindo, “From Man to Superman”, has been used as the title of this part.</p>
<p class="P">Sri Aurobindo usually placed some sort of sign (asterisk, group of asterisks, bar, etc.) to mark his own
	division of pieces into sections. The editors have represented his sign uniformly by a single asterisk.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center"><b>Notes on Individual Pieces in Part Two</b></p>
<p class="P">1. Circa 1927. Heading: “God, Nature and Man” (used as the subtitle of this section; cf. the heading of
	piece 14). The text of the piece is cancelled in the manuscript.</p>
<p class="P">2. Circa 1936.</p>
<p class="P">3. Late 1920s to early 1930s. Heading: “The Divine”.</p>
<p class="P">4. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">5. Circa 1912. Heading: “Ishavasyam”. On the next two pages of the same notebook is written a fragmentary
	commentary on the Isha Upanishad. The present piece clearly is related to that commentary.</p>
<p class="P">6. <em>Arya</em> period (1914-21).</p>
<p class="P">7. Circa 1928-29.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 510</p>
<p class="P">8. Late 1920s to early 1930s. Pieces 8-15 are fragmentary treatments of a theme taken up by Sri Aurobindo
	recurrently over a period of ten to twenty years. Pieces 8-11 all were written in the same notebook. Cf. also piece
	55 and piece 128.</p>
<p class="P">9. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">10. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">11. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">12. Circa 1942. The phrase “Ekam evadvitiyam” was written at the end of the first paragraph, then
	cancelled.</p>
<p class="P">13. 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">14. Circa 1945. Heading: “God, Nature and Soul./God/I” (cf. the subtitle of this section).</p>
<p class="P">15. 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">16. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">17. Circa 1927. This piece was not included in the 1994 edition of <em>Essays Divine and Human</em>.</p>
<p class="P">18. Circa 1930. Heading: “2. The Fundamental Knowledge”. Preceded in the same notebook by “The Path” (Part
	One, Section Five).</p>
<p class="P">19. Circa 1927. The piece clearly is a fragment.</p>
<p class="P">20. 17 June 1914. Heading: “The Tablet of Vedanta.” The opening sentence was written above the title in the
	manuscript, evidently after some or all of the rest had been written.</p>
<p class="P">21. 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">22. Circa 1913.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 511</p>
<p class="P">23. Circa 1942. Heading: “Note on a criticism in <em>the Modern Review</em>”. Written in or shortly after
	August 1942, when The Modern Review (Calcutta) published an adverse review of a Sanskrit-Bengali edition of the Gita
	edited by Anilbaran Roy, a disciple of Sri Aurobindo. The reviewer charged that the Sanskrit phrase <em>para prakrtir jivabhuta</em> (cf. Gita 7.5), translated by Anilbaran according to Sri
	Aurobindo's interpretation as presented in <em>Essays on the Gita</em> (see CWSA vol. 19, pp. 266, 269 and 519),
	could not bear the meaning given it, viz., the supreme Nature which has become the <em>jiva</em>
	(individual soul). Sri Aurobindo never published his note. His disciple Kapali Shastri answered the reviewer from a
	purely grammatical point of view in an article published in the <em>Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual</em> of 1943 (no. 2,
	pp. 236-42). </p>
<p class="P"><br/> 24. Circa 1913.</p>
<p class="P">25. Late 1920s to early 1930s. Headed “(2)”; the unmarked “(1)” presumably is one of the “Ekam evadvitiyam”
	pieces written in the same notebook (cf. pieces 8-11), probably piece 10. Cf. also piece 92.</p>
<p class="P">26. Circa 1940.</p>
<p class="P">27. June 1914 (probably between 3 and 17 June).</p>
<p class="P">28. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">29. Circa 1927. This piece is the third of three drafts, written within a short time of one another, of the
	opening of the revised version of <em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>, Part I, Chapter 11. The first of these
	drafts bears an obvious relation to the printed version, the second an obvious relation to the first, and the third
	to the second; but almost nothing of the third draft appears in the printed version. It has therefore been printed
	here as a separate piece.</p>
<p class="P">30. Early 1913.</p>
<p class="P">31. Circa 1942. Heading: “Psychology”.</p>
<p class="P">32. Circa 1942. In the manuscript this piece comes after a passage consisting of quotations from a book
	dealing with Bergson's “philosophy of change”, and two sentences written by Sri Aurobindo that are reproduced as
	piece 71.</p>
<p class="P">33. Late 1920s to early 1930s. Written at the top of a page used otherwise for what is printed as the
	second footnote to piece 56. The present piece seems to have some textual relation to pieces 56 and 57.</p>
<p class="P">34. <em>Arya</em> period (1914-21). The edge of the manuscript is damaged and several words partly or
	wholly lost. The piece may have been intended for the <em>Arya</em>, but was never published there.</p>
<p class="P">35. Circa 1912. Heading: “Life”.</p>
<p class="P">36. Circa 1912. Heading: “Vedantic Suggestions / The Secret of Life — Ananda”.</p>
<p class="P">37. Middle to late 1940s.</p>
<p class="P">38. Circa 1929.</p>
<p class="P">39. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">40. Circa 1942.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 512</p>
<p class="P">41. Circa 1929. </p>
<p class="P">42. Circa 1918. Possibly intended for the <em>Arya</em>, perhaps as part of a chapter of <em>The Life
		Divine</em>, but not used even in a modified form in any <em>Arya</em> article.</p>
<p class="P">43. Middle to late 1940s. The piece is the second section of a fragment headed “Man and Superman”; the
	first section is printed as piece 80. In the manuscript three asterisks divide the two sections; the editors have
	treated them as separate pieces.</p>
<p class="P">44. Circa 1927. The manuscript of the piece occurs amid drafts of “Man and the Supermind” (Part One,
	Section Five).</p>
<p class="P">45. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">46. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">47. Circa 1947. Heading: “From Man to Superman” (used as the title of this part, cf. piece 53).</p>
<p class="P">48. Circa 1917-18.</p>
<p class="P">49. Circa 1928-29.</p>
<p class="P">50. 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">51. Circa 1927. The piece is a partial draft of “The Involved and Evolving Godhead” (Part One, Section
	Five).</p>
<p class="P">52. Circa 1942.</p>
<p class="P">53. Middle to late 1940s. Heading: “From Man to Superman/I” (used as the title of this part, cf. piece 47).
</p>
<p class="P">54. Middle to late 1940s. Heading: “Superman”.</p>
<p class="P">55. Circa 1942. Heading: “The Secret of Consciousness”. Note the phrase “Ekam evadvitiyam” (cf. pieces
	8-15).</p>

<p class="P">57. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">58. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">59. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">60. Middle to late 1940s. Heading: “Mat[t]er”.</p>

<p class="P">63. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">64. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">65. 1930s, probably 1934.</p>

<p class="P"><br/> 68. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">69. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">70. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">71. Circa 1942. Written below the quotations from a book on Bergson mentioned in the note to piece 32. The
	present piece is headed by the numeral 2, which separates it from the notes. Unlike the notes, the piece is not
	enclosed in inverted commas and so has been considered to be a writing of Sri Aurobindo's.</p>
<p class="P">72. Late 1930s to early 1940s. Heading: “Intuition”.</p>
<p class="P">73. Circa 1927-29.</p>
<p class="P">74. Circa 1928-29.</p>
<p class="P">75. Circa 1928-29. Heading: “On the Supermind.”</p>
<p class="P">76. <em>Arya</em> period (1914-21), probably towards the end of the period. Pieces 76-82, as well as pieces 46, 47 and 53 are treatments of a single theme
	taken up by Sri Aurobindo recurrently over a period of more than twenty-five years (or thirty-five if Aphorism 162 in Part Four is taken into
	consideration). Pieces 64, 66 and 68 are on a related theme. Sri
	Aurobindo's most complete essay on the subject is “Man and the Supermind” (Part One, Section

<p class="P">92. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">93. Late 1920s to early 1930s. The piece is the incomplete second part of an untitled essay, the first part
	of which is published as “The Evolution of Consciousness” (Part One, Section Five). Sri Aurobindo abandoned the
	piece without examining the question from the second of the two “vision-bases” spoken of in the first sentence.</p>
<p class="P">94. Middle to late 1940s. Heading: “The Conscient in unconscious things”.</p>
<p class="P">95. Middle to late 1940s (written immediately after piece 94). Heading: “The Consciousness below the

<p class="P">123. Circa 1917-18. Heading: “The Web of Yoga.”</p>
<p class="P">124. Circa 1913. Heading: “The Evolutionary Aim of Yoga.” The piece apparently is related to “The

<p class="P">125. 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">126. Circa 1920. Heading: “An Introduction to Yoga. /1 / The Meaning of Yoga”.</p>
<p class="P">127. Circa 1913. This long piece can be considered a draft of what, differently developed, became two
	essays, “The Evolutionary Aim in Yoga” and “The Fullness of Yoga — In Condition” (Part One, Section Three). The
	sense of the second of these titles is explained better in the last two paragraphs of the present piece than in the
	revised essay.</p>
<p class="P">128. Late 1920s to early 1930s.</p>
<p class="P">129. Circa 1915. Heading: “Essays in Yoga. / The Seeds of Yoga.”</p>

<p class="P">133. Circa 1927.</p>
<p class="P">134. Circa 1928-29. This piece and piece 135 were written in the
	same notebook; it is possible that they are passages intended for insertion in a larger work, perhaps the revised

<p class="P" style="text-align:center">PART THREE: NOTES AND FRAGMENTS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS</p>
<p class="P">The pieces in this part were written between 1910 and the late 1940s. They have been arranged by subject.
</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Marbles of Time</b>. 1910-14. Editorial title. Cancelled heading: “Marbles”.</p>
<p class="P"><b>A Theory of the Human Being</b>. 1912-14.</p>
<p class="P"><b>A Cyclical Theory of Evolution</b>. 1910-13. This piece probably was written around the same time as the
	preceding one. The opening page or pages (and so also the title) are missing.</p>
<p class="P"><b>A Misunderstanding of Continents</b>. Circa 1918.</p>
<p class="P"><b> Towards Unification.</b> Circa 1912. In the manuscript written beneath the heading: “Studies in the Mahabharat—/ The Book of the
	Woman.” Evidently the passage printed here was meant to be an introduction to a discussion of the eleventh book of
	the Mahabharata, the <em>Stri-Parva</em> or Book of the Woman. Sri Aurobindo broke off work on the piece without
	reaching the proposed subject. The title has been supplied by the editors.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 518</p>
<p class="P"><b>China, Japan and India</b>. Circa 1912. </p>
<p class="P"><b>Renascent India</b>. 1916-18. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Where We Stand in Literature</b>. Circa 1916-18. Draft B was written after Draft A in the same notebook.
</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Origin of Genius</b>. 1910-14.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Poetic Genius</b>. Circa 1912. Editorial title. In the manuscript the heading is “The Genius of
	Valmekie” (see the next piece).</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Voices of the Poets</b>. Circa 1912. Editorial title. The text of this piece, like the preceding
	one, was written under the heading “The Genius of Valmekie”. There is no explicit mention of Valmiki in either
	piece.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Pensées</b>. Circa 1912.</p>
<p class="P"><b>A Dream</b>. 1910-14. Editorial title. Written under the heading “Srevian [?Srevina]/ A Tale of
	Prehistoric Times — Preface.” This introductory fragment is all that exists of a proposed story.</p>
<p class="P"><b>The Beauty of a Crow's Wings</b>. 1910-12. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Science</b>. 1914-21. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Religion</b>. Circa 1927. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P">Late 1930s or 1940s. Editorial title. The piece seems to be related to <em>The Human Cycle</em>. Published
	here for the first time.</p>
<p class="P"><b>Justice</b>. Late 1940s. Editorial title.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center">PART FOUR: THOUGHTS AND APHORISMS</p>
<p class="P">Thoughts and Aphorisms. In or around 1913, Sri Aurobindo wrote 552 aphorisms in a single notebook. In May
	1915 and May 1916 he published ten of them in the monthly review<em>Arya</em>. (These ten have not been reproduced
	here. They form part of <em>Thoughts and Glimpses</em>, included in <em>Essays in Philosophy and Yoga</em>.) Of the
	542 aphorisms that remain, two have been classed with the “Additional Aphorisms” (see below). This leaves 540
	aphorisms forming the main series of <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em>.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 519</p>
<p class="P">In the notebook, the aphorisms were written in nine groupings, three of which are headed Jnana, three Karma
	and three Bhakti. The groupings occur in this order: Jnana, Karma, Bhakti, <br/> <br/> Karma, Jnana, Bhakti,
	Karma, Bhakti, Jnana. The editors have placed the three groupings of Jnana, the three groupings of Karma and the
	three groupings of Bhakti together. Sri Aurobindo numbered all the aphorisms in Jnana and Karma, none of those in
	Bhakti. Since it appears that he intended the numbers to form part of the text, the editors have placed a number
	before each aphorism. These numbers do not correspond to those in the manuscript because the three groupings of each
	section have been placed together and the unnumbered Bhakti section included.</p>
<p class="P">Sri Aurobindo left indications in the manuscript that certain aphorisms were to be moved to a different
	part or position. For example, he seems to have wanted present aphorisms 240 and 241 to be placed after present
	aphorism 98. But since some of these manuscript indications are not clear, the editors have followed the original
	notebook order.</p>
<p class="P">The manuscript, entirely handwritten, was revised once or twice by Sri Aurobindo. The original writing is
	mostly clear, but the revision is sometimes cramped and difficult to read.</p>
<p class="P">“Additional Aphorisms”. The last two aphorisms (541-42) in the notebook containing the main series were not
	clearly intended for inclusion in the Karma, Jnana or Bhakti sections. The editors have placed them in a separate
	section along with five other aphorisms (543-47) that were written in a different notebook. The handwriting of these
	last five indicates that they were written somewhat later than 1913 — possibly as late as 1919.</p>
<p class="P" style="text-align:center">PUBLISHING HISTORY</p>
<p class="P">Some of the material published in this volume was brought out in <em>The Hour of God
	</em>(Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram) in 1959. This
	booklet was reprinted in 1964, 1970 and 1973. In 1982 a new, reorganised edition was published. This was reprinted
	in 1986, 1991
	and 1993. </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 520</p>
<p class="P">
<em>Thoughts and Aphorisms </em>was first published by the Sri Aurobindo
	Ashram in 1958. A second impression of the first edition was issued the next year. New editions textually identical
	to the first came out
	in 1968 and 1971. The texts of the fourth (1977) and fifth (1982) editions each contained corrections of
	transcription errors. The fifth
	edition was reprinted in 1988, 1992 and 1996.
</p>
<p class="P">In 1971 the contents of the original edition of <em>The Hour of God</em>, along with <em>Thoughts and
		Aphorisms</em> and other material, were brought out as <em>The Hour of God and Other Writings</em>, volume 17 of
	the Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library.</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 521</p>
<p class="P">In 1994 those parts of <em>The Hour of God and Other Writings</em> that had not been published during Sri
	Aurobindo's lifetime, along with other material of the same nature that had not yet been published in a book, were
	brought out as <em>Essays Divine and Human</em>. The texts of all the pieces were checked against the manuscripts.
	The present volume is for the most part a reprint of that edition. <br/> Publisher's Note</p>
<p class="P">
<em>Essays Divine and Human </em>consists of short prose pieces
	written by Sri Aurobindo after his arrival in Pondicherry in 1910
	but not published before his passing in 1950. Short prose works
	written during the same period and published during his lifetime
	appear in <em>Essays in Philosophy and Yoga</em>, volume 13 of THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SRI AUROBINDO.
</p>
<p class="P">There are indications in Sri Aurobindo's Pondicherry notebooks that he intended to bring out a collection
	of essays on yoga and other subjects. The headings written above two pieces, “Essays Divine and Human” and “Essays —
	Human and Divine”, seem to have been intended as possible titles for this proposed book. The editors have chosen the
	first of these to be the title of the present volume.</p>
<p class="P">The material has been arranged in four parts:</p>
<p class="P">
	I. <em>Essays Divine and Human</em> - complete essays on yoga and
	related subjects, arranged in five chronological sections.
</p>
<p class="P">II. <em>
		II. <em>From Man to Superman: Notes and Fragments on Philosophy,
			Psychology and Yoga</em>, arranged in three thematic sections.
	</em>, arranged in three thematic sections.</p>
<p class="P">III. <em>Notes and Fragments on Various Subjects</em>, arranged in five thematic sections.</p>
<p class="P">
	IV. <em>Thoughts and Aphorisms</em>, as arranged by the author in
	three sections, with a section of additional aphorisms.
</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 522</p>
<p class="P">All the writings in this book have been reproduced from Sri Aurobindo's manuscripts. He did not prepare any
	of them for publication and left many in an unfinished state. Simple editorial problems arising from illegibility,
	incomplete revision, etc. are indicated by means of the system explained in the Guide to Editorial Notation on the
	next page. More complex problems are discussed in the reference volume. </p>
<p class="P"> Guide to Editorial Notation</p>
<p class="P">The contents of this volume were never prepared by Sri Aurobindo for publication. They have been
	transcribed from manu¬scripts that present a variety of textual difficulties. As far as possible the editors have
	indicated these problems by means of the notation shown below.</p>
<p class="P">Notation Textual Problem</p>
<p class="P">[?word] Doubtful reading</p>
<p class="P">[ . . . ] Illegible word(s), one group of three spaced dots</p>
<p class="P">for each presumed word</p>
<p class="P">[.......] Word(s) lost by mutilation of the manuscript (at the beginning of a piece, indicates that a page
	or pages of the manuscript have been lost)</p>
<p class="P">[word] Word(s) omitted by the author or lost through damage to the manuscript that are required by grammar
	or sense, and that could be supplied by the editors</p>
<p class="P">[? ] Word(s) omitted by the author that could not be supplied by the editors</p>
<p class="P">[ ] Blank left by the author to be filled in later but left unfilled, which the editors were not able to
	fill</p>
<p class="P">[<em>note</em>] Situations requiring textual explication; all such information is printed in italics</p>
<p class="P">Some textual situations requiring editorial intervention could not be handled by the above system. Such
	cases are discussed or tabulated in the reference volume (volume 35).</p>
