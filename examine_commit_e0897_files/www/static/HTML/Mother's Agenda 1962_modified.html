<h2>Mother's Agenda</h2>
<h3>1962</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document ‚Äî 6,000 pages in 13 volumes ‚Äî is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death ‚Äî upon the very power that changes death ‚Äî and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Mother has been unwell the past few days and is receiving almost no one.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1"><em>Are you better?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2">I think so! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3">It's strange, these attacks... bizarre; they seem to have nothing to do with my state of health.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-4">It's a sort of... decentralization. You see, to form a body all the cells are concentrated by a kind of centripetal force that binds them together. Well, now it's just the opposite! A kind of centrifugal force seems to be dispersing them. When it gets a bit too much I go out of my body; outwardly I seem to faint ‚Äì but I don't faint, I remain fully conscious. So obviously this creates a sort of... bizarre disorganization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-5">And there's a strange thing about it, which so far I haven't figured out: it always happens (it has already happened three times, and that's a lot for me) when X<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1" href="#">1</a> comes, the night before he arrives.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-6"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-7">Ah! It doesn't surprise you either?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-8"><em>No, I have noticed that his arrival triggers something off.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-9">Someone happened to be there last time so I didn't fall and hurt myself. But this time I was alone in my bathroom and... actually I was going through a phenomenon of consciousness in which I was spreading over the world ‚Äì spreading <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICALLY</span>, that's the strange thing! The sensation is in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CELLS</span>. There was a movement of diffusion in me, becoming more and more rapid and intense, and then suddenly I found myself on the floor.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-10">There's a seat in my bathroom upstairs, and between the seat and the wall are two small tables (not tables, but small stools where a few things are kept), and a porcelain towel bar (luckily,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 21</p>
<p class="PE"> everything has rounded corners). I found myself wedged in between the seat and the two small tables (a space about this wide!). And all that matter ‚Äì the material substance of the table and the objects on the table and the porcelain seat ‚Äì it all seemed so unreceptive! It doesn't give way like it should for things to be comfortable; but it wasn't that my body was uncomfortable ‚Äì there was no body! The whole set-up was bizarre, everything was in a bizarre and absurd situation which I couldn't really understand, couldn't make out: ‚ÄúWhat's this big lump doing here,‚Äù I seemed to be wondering, ‚Äútaking up so much room, getting in the way?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-11">My elbow had ended up leaning on a little plastic tray I have there, where I keep pencils, ball-point pens, note pads and so forth. The body was leaning on this tray, evidently trying to get up, and the whole thing started cracking noisily under the weight. And in a diffuse but very clear consciousness I was saying to myself, ‚ÄúBut why? What's all this ridiculous noise? And what's this heavy thing doing? What disorder.... There shouldn't be such disorder.‚Äù And it went on crack-crack-cracking. Then suddenly normal consciousness returned ‚Äì to be exact, what returned was the normal <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">RELATIONSHIP</span> consciousness has with things ‚Äì and I said, ‚ÄúWell, really! What a ridiculous situation! What is this elbow doing on that tray? It should realize it's breaking it!‚Äù And when things were all completely back to normal I told my body, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, you idiot! Come on, pick yourself up, get moving!‚Äù Immediately, docile as a little child, it extricated itself, turned around, and stood up straight ‚Äì quite straight. I had scratched my knee, scratched my elbow, and taken three knocks on the head. Luckily there were no sharp edges ‚Äì it was all hard enough, but no sharp edges. Anyway, in the end I was all right, no damage done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-12">No damage at all, but it was a bizarre sensation. So I tried to understand how it could have happened, how I could have so lost my sense of relation to things.... For a long time my body had been telling me, ‚ÄúI've got to lie down, I've got to lie down.‚Äù And I would very sternly reply, ‚ÄúYou don't have time!‚Äù <em>(Laughing)</em> So then this happened. Had I obeyed it and laid down, there would obviously have been no problem. But I was in my experience, going on with my experience, and at the same time I was getting ready to come downstairs. So I told my body, ‚ÄúIt's all right, it's all right, you'll lie down later.‚Äù But it had its own way of lying down! <em>(Laughing)</em> It just stretched out right where it was. Actually it wasn't even stretched out ‚Äì it was all askew.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="PE"> Afterwards, I looked into it a bit. ‚ÄúWhat's wrong with you, anyway?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf you don't have the strength to bear experiences you won't be able to do the work!‚Äù My body answered me very clearly that I was overworking it; and Sri Aurobindo's will was clearly behind it, saying, ‚ÄúIt's overwork. You can't keep on seeing people and talking for hours on end and then going into these kinds of experiences. You can't do both, you have to choose, or at least strike a better balance.‚Äù Well, I certainly wasn't going to stop my experiences, so I took advantage of this little incident to get some rest. It was nothing, really! The doctors were saying, ‚ÄúTake care, the heart isn't working properly,‚Äù and all that. They wanted to start drugging me! All I need is peace and quiet, not drugs. So I took a rest ‚Äì and since I had to have an excuse, I said I wasn't well and needed rest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-13">But following that, and because of the overwork, an old thing I thought I had cured has come back. It was originally brought on by overwork when I was going to the Playground and resting only two hours out of twenty-four, which wasn't enough ‚Äì a sort of ulcer formed between my nose and throat. It's an old complaint, dating from the removal of adenoids in my childhood; the operation left a kind of small cavity, which was nothing in itself, except that occasionally it would give me a cold. But as a result of overwork it came back in the form of an ulcer, and gave me artificial colds; it was so sour and corrosive, a terrible irritation in the throat and nose. It got much worse when I was giving classes at the Playground, and once I showed it to the doctor. ‚ÄúWhy, you have an ulcer!‚Äù he said. A big fuss. He offered to treat me. ‚ÄúNo thanks!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon't worry, it will pass.‚Äù And I began my own yogic treatment. It was over in a week and for three years there was no further sign of it. Recently (the last two or three months) I had felt it trying to come back, for exactly the same reason of overwork. And with that little adventure the other day, it did come back ‚Äì it gave me one of those stupid colds: sneezing, coughing. It's not quite over yet. But it's nothing, it just gives me an excuse <em>(laughing)</em> to tell people I am still not quite well!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-14">I am resting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-15">It's a difficult problem to resolve, because at no price do I want to stop the discipline (the <em>tapasya</em>,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="2" href="#">2</a> to be precise). I don't want to stop. And both things together are clearly too much for a stupid little body ‚Äì stupid mainly because it lives in tension.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="PE"> These past few days I've had some interesting experiences from this standpoint. I had what is commonly called fever, but it wasn't fever ‚Äì it was a resurfacing from the subconscient of all the struggles, all the tensions this body has had for... what will soon be eighty-three years. I went through a period in my life when the tension was tremendous, because it was psychological and vital as well as physical: a perpetual struggle against adverse forces; and during my stay in Japan, particularly... oh, it was terrible! So at night, everything that had been part of that life in Japan ‚Äì people, things, movements, circumstances ‚Äì all of it seemed to be surrounding my body in the form of vital<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="3" href="#">3</a> vibrations, and to be taking the place of my present state, which had completely vanished. For hours during the night, the body was reliving all the terrible tensions it had during those four years in Japan. And I realized how much (because at the time you pay no attention; the consciousness is busy with something else and not concentrated on the body), how much the body resists and is tense. And just as I was realizing this, I had a communication with Sri Aurobindo: ‚ÄúBut you're keeping it up!‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúYour body still has the habit of being tense.‚Äù (It's much less now, of course; it's quite different since the inner consciousness is in perfect peace, but the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BODY</span> keeps the habit of being tense.) For instance, in the short interval between the time I get up and the time I come down to the balcony,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="4" href="#">4</a> when I am getting ready (I have to get this body ready to come down)... well, the body is tense about being ready in time. And that's why accidents happen at that moment. So the following morning I said, ‚ÄúAll right, no more tension,‚Äù and I was exclusively concerned with keeping my body perfectly tranquil ‚Äì I was no later than usual! So it's obviously just one of the body's bad habits. Everything went off the same as usual, and since then things are better. But it's a nasty habit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-16">And so I looked. ‚ÄúIs it something particular to this body?‚Äù I wondered. To everyone who has lived closely with it, my body gives the impression of two things: a very concentrated, very stubborn will, and... such endurance! Sri Aurobindo used to tell me he had never dreamed a body could have such endurance. And</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="PE"> that's probably why.... But I don't want to curtail this ability in any way, because it is a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CELLULAR</span> will, and a cellular endurance too ‚Äì which is quite intriguing. It's not a central will and central endurance (that's something else altogether) ‚Äì it's cellular. That's why Sri Aurobindo used to tell me this body had been specially prepared and chosen for the Work ‚Äì because of its capacity for obstinate endurance and will. But that's no reason to exercise this ability uselessly! So I am making sure it relaxes now; I tell it constantly, ‚ÄúNow, now! Just let go! Relax, have some fun, where's the harm in it?‚Äù I have to tell it to be quiet, very quiet. And it's very surprised to hear that: ‚ÄúAh! Can I live that way? I don't have to hurry? I can live that way?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-17">So that's why I am resting. Am I better or not? Things are always the same. Were I to start doing what I was doing before, which I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNEW</span> all along was absolutely unreasonable.... It's not that I didn't know it; I did know and I wasn't happy about it, because I knew I was doing something I shouldn't. I have no intention of starting again, but if I had said, ‚ÄúI am withdrawing for good,‚Äù it would have been.... If you knew how <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MANY</span> things have gone slack <span class="note_0">[in the Ashram]</span>! And how many people I am telling off: ‚ÄúWell, you wouldn't have done that a week ago!‚Äù Oh, that's an experience in itself ‚Äì to see what people's so-called faithfulness depends on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-18">You have to constantly keep a firm grip on them ‚Äì constantly, constantly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-19">That's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-20">Here, mon petit,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="5" href="#">5</a> I've been given something very good! <em>(Mother laughs and gives Satprem a tin of... perhaps it was foie gras.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-21"><em>I've been slacking off too.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-22">For material substance it's a necessity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-23">It's exactly what I was complaining about: ‚ÄúIf this stuff can't go on without flagging, if it can't take it and absolutely has to relax, if it can't keep up with the movement of consciousness and just has to slacken from time to time, well... how can it ever be supramentalized?‚Äù Precisely what everyone has always said: ‚ÄúIt</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 25</p>
<p class="PE"> <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CANNOT</span> hold the charge, it has to let go. It can't hold the charge of Energy.‚Äù And especially <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span> Energy, which seems almost abnormal to people ‚Äì an Energy that works like this <em>(inflexible gesture)</em> and can keep it up indefinitely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-24">And when the body can't take it ‚Äúlike this,‚Äù it breaks ‚Äì you find yourself between a table and... and suddenly you're flat on the floor!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-25">That must be it, because I've fainted fairly often in my life. Even when I was young, I would remain conscious, and there was a whole period when I used to go out of my body, which I would always immediately see in some ridiculous position (just where it had no business being, of course!). So I would rush back into it and say, ‚ÄúCome on! What's wrong with you!‚Äù Then it would shake itself and get moving again, like a donkey ‚Äì you give it a good whack, and it gets back to work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-26">This need for relaxation was never psychological with me. And I have seen that the habit people have of slackening has the same origin: it's not necessarily negligence or vital weakness, the body simply gets winded. It bears up under the tension of vital energy, but eventually it gets winded, tired out, and needs rest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-27">Given the world's present set-up, this is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äì but if the supramental world were to be realized, it shouldn't remain normal. Clearly, a considerable change has to take place in the physical substance. That will probably be the essential difference between the bodies fashioned by Nature's methods and those to be fashioned by supramental knowledge ‚Äì a new element will come in, and we will no longer be ‚Äúnatural.‚Äù But so long as this natural element is present, well, a certain amount of patience is probably required ‚Äì let the body catch its breath, otherwise something gives way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-28">It gets much less winded, of course, when you have the inner equality of the divine Presence. So much fatigue is due to excess tension produced by desire or effort or struggle, by the constant battle against all opposing forces. All that can go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-29">We tire ourselves out quite needlessly.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-30">During that return to the past over the last few days, the life I led with Sri Aurobindo suddenly came back to me.... What helped this to happen was reading passages about me in his book,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="6" href="#">6</a>¬†</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 26</p>
<p class="PE"> letters he wrote about me that I had never read before. And it all came back, those full thirty years I lived with him....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-31">Psychologically, there was no struggle, no tension, no effort ‚Äì not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONCE</span>; I was living in total and confident serenity. On the material plane there were attacks, but even these he took upon himself. Well, I saw it all, all those thirty years of life; not for a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SECOND</span> did I have any sense of responsibility, in spite of all the work I was doing, all the organizing and everything. He had supposedly passed on the responsibility to me, you see, but he was standing behind ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HE</span> was actually doing everything! I was active, but with absolutely no responsibility. I never felt responsible for a single minute ‚Äì he took the full responsibility. It was really....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-32">For the first seven years he was doing the work, not me. He was the one who saw people; I looked after his personal affairs, his housekeeping, his food, his clothes and so forth. I kept myself quietly busy with that, doing nothing else, not seeing people, simply looking after his material life ‚Äì like a child at play. It was seven years of integral peace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-33">Later, when he withdrew and put me in front, there was naturally a bit more activity, as well as the semblance of responsibility ‚Äì but it was only a semblance. What security! A sense of total, total security ‚Äì for thirty years. Not once.... There was just a single scratch, so to speak, when he had that accident and broke his leg. There was a formation at work (an adverse force) and he wasn't taking sufficient precautions for himself because it was directed against both of us, and more especially against me (it had tried once or twice to fracture my skull, things like that). Well, he was so intent on keeping it from seriously touching my body that it managed to sneak in and break his leg. That was a shock. But he straightened everything out again almost immediately ‚Äì it all fell back into place and went on like that till the end.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-34">And the feeling was so strong that even during his illness (which lasted for months, you know), I had a sense of perfect security; so much so that the idea of his life being really affected in the least by this illness couldn't even occur to me! I didn't want to believe it when the doctor said, ‚ÄúIt's over.‚Äù I didn't want to believe it. And as long as I stayed in the room... with me in the room he couldn't leave his body. And so there was a terrible tension in him ‚Äì on the one hand the inner will to depart, and then this thing holding him there in his body: the fact that I knew he was alive and could only be alive. He had to signal me to go to my room, supposedly to rest (I didn't rest); and no sooner had I left his room than he was gone.¬†</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 27</p>
<p class="PE"> They immediately called me back.... That's how it was. Then when he came to me, when I really saw what had happened, when he went out of his body and entered into mine (the most material part of him, the part involved with external things) and I understood that I had the entire responsibility for all the work <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AND</span> for the sadhana<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7" href="#">7</a> ‚Äì well, then I locked a part of me away, a deep psychic<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="8" href="#">8</a> part that was living, beyond all responsibility, in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ECSTASY</span> of the realization: the Supreme. I took it and locked it away, I sealed it off and said, ‚ÄúYou're not moving until... until all the rest is ready.‚Äù</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-35">That in itself was a miracle. If I hadn't done it I would have followed him ‚Äì and there would have been no one to do the Work. I would have followed him automatically, without even thinking about it. But when he entered into me, he said, ‚ÄúYou will do the work; one of us had to go, and I am going, but you will do the work.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-36">And that door was opened again only ten years later, in 1960. Even then, it was done with great care ‚Äì it was one of last year's major difficulties.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-37">And only in the last few days have all those memories been allowed to rise up again from the subconscient where they were being kept; and with that, the state I lived in for thirty years has resurfaced ‚Äì with this tremendous difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-38">And suddenly I said to myself, ‚ÄúHow could it be? During all the time he was here, the time we were together (after I came back from Japan, when we were together), life, life on earth, lived such a wondrous divine possibility, so... really so unique, something it had never lived to such an extent and in such a way, for thirty years, and it didn't even notice!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-39">That ....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-40">That's what I have been experiencing recently.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-41">Yes, at one point I wondered (I don't remember when, a few days ago): ‚ÄúHow could people have lived here, so near (but the same thing is still happening), how could human beings on earth</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 28</p>
<p class="PE"> who had an aspiration, who had their consciousness turned towards those things, have lived that possibility, have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAD</span> that possibility at their fingertips, without being able to take advantage of it! How could something so wonderful and unique have taken place here, and yet people had such a small and childish and superficial image of it!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-42">Truly, I wondered, ‚ÄúHas the time really come? Is it possible?... Or will it once again be postponed?‚Äù</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-43">Yesterday evening I read something in the book<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="9" href="#">9</a>.... Sri Aurobindo is writing to someone who said, ‚ÄúHow lucky people are who live near the Mother.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou don't know what you're talking about!‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúTo live in the Mother's physical presence is one of the most difficult things.‚Äù Do you remember this passage? I didn't know he had written that. ‚ÄúWell, well...‚Äù I thought. He writes, ‚ÄúIt is hard to stay near her, because the difference between the physical consciousness of all you people and her physical consciousness is so enormous....‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="10" href="#">10</a> Indeed, that's what tires me out.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-48">That, more than anything else, may be why I needed a bit of solitude: to reactivate that part of the psychic being which was the individual intermediary between true Consciousness and the body-consciousness: the part which had lived <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>, was aware of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>, knew <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> ‚Äì knew that wondrous miracle.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 30</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-63">To cherish in secret the sense of sin.... No, I can't say I've had that experience, in the sense that I have never had a very pronounced love of virtue.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-64">That's another thing I have noticed: even in my childhood I was already conscious of what Sri Aurobindo calls ‚Äúliving divinely,‚Äù that is, outside the sense of Good and Evil.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-65">This was counterbalanced by a terrible censor which never left me.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11" href="#">11</a> It took Sri Aurobindo to clear it from my path.

My consciousness has always been centered on action. It was a vision, a perception of the line to be followed ‚Äì or the many lines to be followed ‚Äì for the action to be accomplished. And any deviation from what to me was the luminous line, the straight line (not geometrically straight: the luminous line, the line expressing the divine Will), the slightest</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 31</p>
<p class="PE"> deviation from that, and... oh, it was the only thing that tormented me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-66">And the torment didn't come from me, it came from that character hooked on to my consciousness and constantly whipping me, hounding me, ill-treating me ‚Äì what people call their ‚Äúconscience,‚Äù which has nothing whatsoever to do with consciousness!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="13" href="#">13</a> It's an adverse being, and whatever it can change, it changes for the worse; whatever is susceptible to being changed into something antidivine, it changes.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-67">But this was the only thing; there was never, never the idea of being either virtuous or sinful ‚Äì never.

<p class="PE"> <em>(Concerning Satprem's question on the experience of the ‚Äúsupramental ship‚Äù:)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-92">Did you get my note, petit?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-93">I've said something on the subject somewhere.... Do you remember that gentleman from Madras who had asked a question?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="15" href="#">1</a> There was an indication there....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-94">Because I followed the thread, I put myself back in contact with the experience of the supramental ship, and I noticed that it had a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DECISIVE</span> effect on my position: the required conditions were established quite clearly, precisely, and definitively by that experience. In that respect, it was interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-95">Once and for all it has swept away all these notions ‚Äì not merely ordinary moral notions, but everything people here in India consider necessary for the spiritual life. In that respect, it was very instructive. And first and foremost, this so-called ascetic purity.... Ascetic purity is merely the rejection of all vital movements. Instead of taking these movements and turning them towards the Divine, instead of seeing, that is, the supreme Presence in them (and so letting the Supreme deal with them freely), He is told <em>(laughing)</em>: ‚ÄúNo ‚Äì it's none of Your business! You have no say in it.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-96">As for the physical, it's an old and well-known story ‚Äì ascetics have always rejected it; but they also reject the vital. And they're all like that here, even... X may have changed somewhat by now, but at the beginning he was no different either. Only things classically recognized as holy or admitted by religious tradition were accepted ‚Äì the sanctity of marriage, for example, and things like that.... But a free life? Not a chance! It was wholly incompatible with religious life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-97">Well, all that has been completely swept away, once and for all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-98">This doesn't mean that what's being asked of us is easier! It's probably far more difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-99">I mentioned the principal psychological requirement in my answer to that American: a state of perfect equality. This is an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ABSOLUTE</span> condition. Over the years since that experience I have observed that no supramental vibration whatsoever can be transmitted without this perfect equality. The slightest contradiction of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="PE"> that equality ‚Äì in other words, the least movement of ego, of egoistic preference ‚Äì and everything is blocked, transmission stops. This is already quite a large stumbling block.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-100">And, over and above this, for the realization to be total, there are two other conditions, which aren't easy either. Intellectually, they're not too difficult; in fact, for someone who has practiced yoga, followed a discipline (I am not speaking here of just anyone), they're relatively easy. Psychologically too, given this equality, there's no great difficulty. But as soon as you come to the material plane ‚Äì the physical plane ‚Äì and then to the body, it isn't easy. These two conditions are first, the power to expand, to widen almost indefinitely, enabling you to widen to the dimensions of the supramental consciousness ‚Äì which is total. The supramental consciousness is the consciousness of the Supreme in his totality. By ‚Äútotality,‚Äù I mean the Supreme in his aspect of Manifestation. Naturally, from a higher point of view, from the viewpoint of the essence ‚Äì the essence of that which in Manifestation becomes the Supermind ‚Äì what's necessary is a capacity for total identification with the Supreme, not only in his aspect of Manifestation, but in his static or nirvanic aspect, outside of the Manifestation: Nonbeing. But in addition, one must be capable of identifying with the Supreme in the Becoming. And that implies both these things: an expansion that is nothing less than indefinite, and that should simultaneously be a total plasticity enabling one to follow the Supreme in his Becoming. You don't merely have to be as vast as the universe at one point in time, but indefinitely in the Becoming. These are the two conditions. They must be potentially present.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-101">Down to the vital, we are still in the realm of things that are more than feasible ‚Äì they are done. But on the material level it results in my misadventures of the other day.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="16" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-102">But even accepting all these misadventures a priori, things remain difficult because there's a double movement: both a cellular transformation and a capacity for ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that could replace expansion with readjustment, a constant intercellular reorganization.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="17" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 36</p>
<p class="PE"> The way they are now, of course, our bodies are rigid and heavy ‚Äì it's unspeakable, actually; if it weren't for that we would never grow old. For instance, my vital being is more full of energy, and thus full of youth and power to grow, than when I was twenty. There's really no comparison. The power is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INFINITELY</span> greater... yet the body is going to pieces ‚Äì it's really something unspeakable. So a way has to be found to bridge this gap between the vital and the material being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-103">Not that the problem hasn't been partially solved: hatha yogis have solved it, partially ‚Äì provided you do nothing else (that's the trouble). Yet having the knowledge, we should have the power to do what's necessary without making it our exclusive preoccupation. At any rate, this possibility is certainly not altogether unknown; for the first few months after I retired to my room,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="18" href="#">4</a> when I had cut all contact with the outside, it was working very well... even extraordinarily so! Lots of disorders in my body were surmounted, and I had many fairly precise indications that if I continued like that long enough I would regain everything that had been lost, and with an even better equilibrium. I mean that the functional equilibrium was far superior. Only when I came back into contact with the world did it all come to a halt and begin to deteriorate ‚Äì all the more so as it was aggravated by this discipline of expansion making me constantly ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANTLY</span> ‚Äì absorb mountains of difficulties to be resolved. And so....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-104">With the mind, it's rather easy ‚Äì you can put things back in order in five minutes, it's not difficult. With the vital it's already a bit more troublesome, it takes a little longer. But when you come to the material level, well.... There's a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONTAGION</span> of wrong cellular functioning and a kind of internal disorganization ‚Äì things not staying in their proper places. Each vibration absorbed from the outside instantly creates a disorder, dislocates everything, creates wrong contacts and disrupts the organization; it sometimes takes <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HOURS</span> to put it all back in order. Consequently, if I really want to make use of this body's possibility without having to face the necessity of changing it because it can't follow along, then, materially, I would really need, as much as possible, to stop having to gulp down all sorts of things that drag me years backwards.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-105">It's difficult... difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-106">So long as there's no question of physical transformation, the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 37</p>
<p class="PE"> psychological and in large part, the subjective point of view is sufficient ‚Äì and that's relatively easy. But when it comes to incorporating matter into the work, matter as it is in this world where the very starting point is false (we start off in unconsciousness and ignorance), well, it's very difficult. Because, to recover the consciousness it has lost, Matter has had to individualize itself, and for that ‚Äì for the form to last and retain this possibility of individuality ‚Äì it has been created with a certain indispensable measure of rigidity. And that rigidity is the main obstacle to the expansion, to the plasticity and suppleness necessary for receiving the Supermind. I constantly find myself facing this problem, which is utterly concrete, absolutely material when you're dealing with cells that have to remain cells and not vaporize into some nonphysical reality, and at the same time have to have a suppleness, a lack of rigidity, enabling them to widen indefinitely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-107">There have been times, while working in the most material mind (the mind ingrained in the material substance), when I felt my brain swelling and swelling and swelling, and my head becoming so large it seemed about to burst! On two occasions I was forced to stop, because it was... (was it only an impression, or was it a fact?) in any event it seemed dangerous, as if the head would burst, because what was inside was becoming too tremendous (it was that power in Matter, that very powerful deep blue light which has such powerful vibrations; it is able to heal, for example, and change the functioning of the organs ‚Äì really a very powerful thing materially). Well then, that's what was filling my head, more and more, more and more, and I had the feeling that my skull was (it was painful, you know)... that there was a pressure inside my skull pushing out, pushing everything out.... I wondered what was going to happen. Then, instead of following the movement, helping it along and going with it, I became immobile, passive, to see what would happen. And both times it stopped. I was no longer helping the movement along, you see, I simply remained passive ‚Äì and it came to a halt, there was a sort of stabilization.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-108">But Sri Aurobindo must have had the experience <span class="note_0">[of cellular expansion]</span>, because he said positively that it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">COULD</span> be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-109">The question, of course, is the supramentalization of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MATTER</span> ‚Äì the consciousness, that's nothing at all. Most people who have had that experience had it on the mental level, which is relatively</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 38</p>
<p class="PE"> easy. It's very easy: abolition of limits set by the ego, indefinite expansion with a movement following the rhythm of the Becoming. Mentally, it's all very easy. Vitally.... A few months after I withdrew to my room, I had the experience in the vital ‚Äì wonderful, magnificent! Of course to have the experience there, the mind must have undergone a change, one must be in complete communion; without exception, any individual vital being that hasn't been prepared by what might be called a sufficient mental foundation would be panic-stricken. All those poor people who get scared at the least little experience had better not dabble with this ‚Äì they'd panic! But as it happens ‚Äì through divine grace, you might say ‚Äì my vital, the vital being of this present incarnation, was born free and victorious. It has never been afraid of anything in the vital world; the most fantastic experiences were practically child's play. But when I had that experience, it was so interesting that for a few weeks I was tempted to stay in it; it was.... I once told you a little about that experience (it was quite a while ago, at least two years).<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="19" href="#">5</a> I told you that even during the day I seemed to be sitting on top of the Earth ‚Äì that was this realization in the vital world. And what fantastic nights it gave me! Nights I have never been able to describe to anyone and never mentioned ‚Äì but I would look forward to the night as a marvelous adventure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-110">I voluntarily renounced all that in order to go further. And when I did it, I understood what people here in India mean when they say: <em>he surrendered his experience</em>. I had never really understood what that meant. When I did it, I understood. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don't want to stop there; I am giving it all to You, that I may go on to the end.‚Äù Then I understood what it meant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-111">Had I kept it, oh ‚Äì I would have become one of those world-renowned phenomena, turning the course of the earth's history upside down! A stupendous power! Stupendous, unheard-of.... But it meant stopping there, accepting that experience as final ‚Äì I went on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-112">Well. So now, what can I tell you that's interesting ‚Äì everything I've just said is a sort of miscellany, and three-fourths unusable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-113"><em>But, Mother....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-114">I didn't say it with the idea of writing an article!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 39</p>
<p class="PE"> When I read that note<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">6</a> you sent me, I immediately reconnected with the experience, and things became clear. I have told them to you as well as they can be told....</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-115">The people on that ship had these two capacities: one, the capacity for indefinite expansion of consciousness on all planes, including the material; and two, limitless plasticity in order to follow the movement of the Becoming.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-116">It was taking place in the subtle physical. The people who had patches on their bodies and had to be sent back were always the ones who lacked the plasticity those two movements required. But the main thing was the movement of expansion; the progressive movement, the movement of following the Becoming, seemed to be a subsequent preoccupation ‚Äì for those who had landed. The preparation on the boat concerned that capacity for expansion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-117">Another thing I didn't mention to you when I related the experience was that the ship had no engine. Everything was set in motion through will power ‚Äì people, things (even the clothes people wore were a result of their will). And this gave all things and every person's shape a great suppleness, because there was an awareness of this will ‚Äì which is not a mental will but a will of the Self, what could be called a spiritual will or a soul-will (to give the word soul that particular meaning). I have that experience right here when there's an absolute spontaneity in action, I mean when the action ‚Äì for instance, an utterance or a movement ‚Äì is not determined by the mind, and not even (not to mention thought or intellect), not even by the mind that usually sets us in motion. Generally, when we do something, we can perceive in ourselves a will to do it; when you watch yourself, you see this: there is always (it can happen in a flash) the will to do. When you are conscious and watch yourself doing something, you see in yourself the will to do it ‚Äì this is where the mind intervenes, its normal intervention, the established order in which things happen. But the supramental action is decided by a leap over the mind. The action is direct, with no need to go through the mind. Something enters directly into contact with the vital centers and activates them without going through the mind ‚Äì yet in full consciousness. The consciousness doesn't function in the usual sequence, it functions from the center of spiritual will straight to matter.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 40</p>
<p class="PE"> And so long as you can keep that absolute immobility in the mind, the inspiration is absolutely pure ‚Äì it comes pure. When you can catch and hold onto this while you're speaking, then what comes to you is unmixed too, it stays pure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-118">This is an extremely delicate functioning, probably because we're not used to it ‚Äì the slightest movement, the slightest mental vibration disrupts everything. But as long as it lasts, it's perfectly pure. And in a supramentalized life this has to be the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANT</span> state. Mentalized will should no longer intervene; because you may well have a spiritual will, your life may be the constant expression of spiritual will (it's what happens to all who feel themselves guided by the Divine within), but it still comes through a mental transcription. Well, as long as it's that way, it's not the supramental life. The supramental life <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NO LONGER</span> goes through the mind ‚Äì the mind is an immobile zone of transmission. The least little twitch is enough to upset everything.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-119">So we can say that the Supermind can express itself through a terrestrial consciousness only when there is a constant state of perfect equality ‚Äì equality arising out of spiritual identification with the Supreme: all becomes the Supreme in perfect equality. And it must be automatic, not an equality obtained through conscious will or intellectual effort or an understanding preceding the state itself ‚Äì none of that. It has to be spontaneous and automatic; one must no longer react to what comes from outside as though it were coming from outside. That pattern of reception and reaction must be replaced by a state of constant perception and (I don't mean identical in all cases, because each thing necessarily calls forth its own particular reaction)... but practically free from all rebound, you might say. It's the difference between something coming from outside and striking you, making you react, and something freely circulating and quite naturally generating the vibrations needed for the overall action. I don't know if I am making myself clear.... It's the difference between a vibratory movement circulating within an <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IDENTICAL</span> field of action, and a movement from an outside source, touching you and getting a reaction (this is the usual state of human consciousness). But once the consciousness is identified with the Supreme, all movements are, so to speak, inner ‚Äì inner in the sense that nothing comes from outside; there are only things circulating,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 41</p>
<p class="PE"> which, through similarity or necessity, naturally generate or change the vibrations within the circulatory milieu.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-120">I am very familiar with this, because I am now constantly in that state. I never have the feeling of something coming from outside and bumping into me; there's rather the sense of multiple and sometimes contradictory inner movements, and of a constant circulation generating the inner changes necessary to the movement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-121">This is the indispensable foundation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-122">I've had that experience for a very long time and now it's completely established. It used to be transitory, but now it's constant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-123">It is the indispensable foundation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-124">And in that state, expansion follows almost automatically, necessitating certain adjustments in the body which are difficult to work out. I am still completely immersed in this problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-125">Then that suppleness.... It means a capacity for decrystallizing oneself; the whole span of life given over to self-individualization is a period of conscious, willed crystallization, which then has to be undone. To become a conscious, individualized being there has to be a constant, constant, willed crystallization, in everything; and afterwards, again constantly, the opposite movement has to be made ‚Äì with an even greater will. But at the same time, the consciousness must not lose the benefit of what has been acquired through individualization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-126">It is difficult, I must say.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-127">For thought, it's elementary, very simple. It's not difficult for the feelings either; for the heart, the emotional being, to expand to the dimensions of the Supreme is relatively easy. But this body! It's very difficult, very difficult to do without the body losing its center (how can I put it?)... its center of coagulation ‚Äì without it dissolving into the surrounding mass. Although, if one were in a natural environment, with mountains and forests and rivers, with lots of space and lots of natural beauty, it could be rather pleasant! But it's physically impossible to take a single step outside one's body without meeting unpleasant, painful things. At times you come in contact with a pleasant substance, something harmonious, warm, vibrating with a higher light; it happens. But it's rare. Flowers, yes, sometimes flowers ‚Äì sometimes, not always. But this material world, oh! It batters you from all sides; it claws you, mauls you ‚Äì you get clawed and scraped and battered by all sorts of things which... which just don't blossom. How hard it all is! Oh, how closed human life is! How shriveled, hardened, without light, without warmth... let alone joy.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 42</p>
<p class="PE"> While sometimes, when you see water flowing along, or a ray of sunlight in the trees ‚Äì oh, how it sings! The cells sing, they are happy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-128">Well, mon petit, that's all I can tell you. If you can make something out of it.... But it's a new experience. Isn't it interesting? I have to put it into the form of an experience ‚Äì there's no other way for it to be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-129">But keep it as impersonal as possible!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-130">Do you need this thing <span class="note_0">[Mother's note to Satprem]</span>?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-132"><em>(Later, as Mother is leaving)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-133">If we continue along this path, we will surely be able to do some worthwhile work, because it's all new. It's quite new ‚Äì I never spoke of this with Sri Aurobindo because at the time I didn't have those experiences. I had all the psychological experiences, experiences in the mind, even the most material mind, or in the vital or the physical consciousness ‚Äì the physical <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSCIOUSNESS</span> ‚Äì but not in the body. That's something new, it started only three or four years ago.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-134">All the rest is easy. Everything up to that point is settled ‚Äì settled very nicely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-135"><em>Since the physical transformation is so difficult, one is tempted to wonder whether it wouldn't be advantageous to ‚Äúmaterialize‚Äù something, to work occultly ‚Äì to create a new body by occult means....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-136">That was the idea: for a few beings to first attain, here in this physical world, a level of realization giving them the power to materialize a supramental being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-137">I once told you I put a body on a vital being<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="21" href="#">7</a> ‚Äì but I couldn't have made that body material; it would have been impossible: something is lacking. Something is lacking. Even if it were made visible, it would probably not be possible to make it permanent ‚Äì at the slightest opportunity, it would dematerialize. What we can't get is that permanence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-138">It's something Sri Aurobindo and I have discussed (‚Äúdiscussed‚Äù is one way of putting it), something we spoke about, and his view</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE"> was the same as mine: there is a power, yes, to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FIX</span> the form here on earth, a power we don't have. Even people with the ability to materialize things (like Madame Th√©on, for instance) can't make their materializations last; it can't be done, they don't last ‚Äì they don't have the quality of physical things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-139">And without this quality, well... the creation's continuity could not be assured.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-140">Yes, that's an interesting point. One might indeed wonder about it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-141">I knew the whole occult procedure in detail, but I would never have been able to make that being more material, even if I had tried ‚Äì visible, yes, but not permanent and progressive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-142">And mind you (this is my personal case), I don't think I have wasted any time. Because you might say that had I known forty years ago what I know now ‚Äì at the age of forty instead of eighty ‚Äì well, there would have been the sense of a lot more time to work with. But I haven't been wasting time. I haven't wasted any time. All that time was necessary to get me where I am today.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-143">I don't think I've been going slowly. As I told you last time, I had the most wonderful conditions, those thirty years with Sri Aurobindo ‚Äì as wonderful as could be. I haven't wasted my time. Oh, it was hour by hour!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-144">It is a long, drawn-out work.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-167">Especially for those who think they're so superior.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-168">But it really does correspond to something very deep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-169">This is exactly the experience I have been going through these past few days; since the day before yesterday it seems to have reached its peak, and this morning it developed into a comprehensive vision, an earth-encompassing vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-170">It's almost like a reversal of attitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-171">Actually, people have always taken themselves for victims hounded by adverse forces ‚Äì the courageous fight back, the rest lament. But increasingly there has been a very concrete vision of the role the adverse forces play in the creation, of their almost absolute necessity as goads to make the creation progress and become its Origin again. And there was such a clear vision that one should accomplish one's own transformation ‚Äì that's what we must pray for, what we must work out ‚Äì rather than demand the conversion or abolition of the adverse forces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-172">And this is all from the terrestrial, not the individual standpoint (for the individual standpoint, it's quite clear): I am speaking from the terrestrial standpoint.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-173">And there was the sudden vision of all the error, all the incomprehension, all the ignorance, all the darkness and ‚Äì even worse ‚Äì all the ill will in the earth's consciousness, which felt responsible for the prolongation of those adverse forces and beings and offered them up in a great... it was more than an aspiration, it was a sort of holocaust, so that the adverse forces might disappear, might no longer have any reason to exist, no longer need to be there to point out all that has to change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-174">The adverse forces were necessitated by all these negations of the divine life. And this movement of earth consciousness towards the Supreme, the offering of all these things with such extraordinary intensity, was a kind of reparation so that those adverse forces might disappear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-175">The experience was very intense. It crystallized around a small nucleus of experiences too personal to mention (because I wasn't the only one involved), which translated into this: ‚ÄúTake all my wrongdoings, take them all, accept them, obliterate them, and may those forces disappear.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-176">That's essentially what this aphorism says, seen from the other end. So long as a single human consciousness carries the possibility of feeling, acting, thinking or being in opposition to the great</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 47</p>
<p class="PE"> divine Becoming, it is impossible to blame anyone else for it; it is impossible to blame the adverse forces, which are kept in the creation as a means of making you see and feel how far you still have to go.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-177">It was like a memory,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24" href="#">1</a> an eternally present memory of that consciousness of supreme Love emanated by the Lord onto earth ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INTO</span> earth ‚Äì to draw it back again to Him. And truly it was the descent of the very essence of the divine nature into the most total divine negation, and thus the abandonment of the divine condition to take on terrestrial darkness, so as to bring Earth back to the divine state. And unless That, that supreme Love, becomes all-powerfully conscious here on Earth, the return can never be definitive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-178">It came after the vision of the great divine Becoming.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="25" href="#">2</a> ‚ÄúSince this world is progressive,‚Äù I was wondering, ‚Äúsince it is increasingly becoming the Divine, won't there always be this deeply painful sense of the nondivine, of the state that, compared with the one to come, is not divine? Won't there always be what we call 'adverse forces,' in other words, things that don't harmoniously follow the movement?‚Äù Then came the answer, the vision of That: ‚ÄúNo, the moment of this very Possibility is drawing near, the moment for the manifestation of the essence of perfect Love, which can transform this unconsciousness, this ignorance and this ill will that goes with it into a luminous and joyous progression, wholly progressive, wholly comprehensive, thirsting for perfection.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-179">It was very concrete.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-180">And it corresponds to a state where you are so <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PERFECTLY</span> identified with all that is, that you concretely become all that is antidivine ‚Äì and so you can offer it up.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-187">It happened this morning, with great simplicity, but at the same time it had something so vast and almighty in it, as if the Universal Mother were turning towards the Lord and saying, ‚ÄúAt last! We are ready.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-193">It was the same experience when I told Sri Aurobindo that India was free; it was the Universal Mother speaking from what could be called Her origin ‚Äì it was from that level ‚Äì and the thing took thirty-five years to come down on Earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-194">When I had the experience that the time had come for the supramental Force to descend on Earth, I followed the effects of that descent, I followed the effects and the consequences in my consciousness.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-195">The first rather tangible manifestation was this vision of the boat; with that, things became more concrete, it radically changed something in the attitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-196">We're at another stage now.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-197">This recent period has been very difficult. I see clearly that it was a preparation ‚Äì to prepare the way for that experience. It came to reverse the attitude, the attitude of struggling to surmount, subdue and abolish everything antidivine in creation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-198">Up till now, this attitude was probably (not probably ‚Äì certainly) necessary to prepare things. But now there's a sort of sudden reversal, as if the moment had come for the creative principle, the force, the universal creative Force to say, ‚ÄúThis too is Me. For it is time for it to disappear. This too is Me: I no longer treat it as an enemy to get rid of; I accept it as Myself, so that it truly does become Me.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-199">And it was preceded by a kind of anguish: ‚ÄúWill there always be something that, compared with the state to come, seems antidivine?‚Äù No: after a long preparation, it becomes capable of feeling divine ‚Äì and thus of being divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-200">Looking at things externally, in terms of present material reality, there is still a lot of ground to be covered before the new manifestation becomes an actual fact. What we have now is probably the seed of the thing ‚Äì like the seed of India's freedom, which later blossomed.</p>

<h4 class="Ps">ADDENDUM</h4>
<p class="Ps"><em>(Two letters of Sri Aurobindo on psychoanalysis)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-201"><em>[Note: This Letter was published in the Letters on Yoga, Cent. Ed., XXIV.1605 ff.]</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-202">Your practice of psycho-analysis was a mistake. It has, for the time at least, made the work of purification more complicated, not easier. The psycho-analysis of Freud is the last thing that one should associate with yoga. It takes up a certain part, the darkest, the most perilous, the unhealthiest part of the nature, the lower vital subconscious layer, isolates some of its most morbid phenomena and attributes to it and them an action out of all proportion to its true role in the nature. Modern psychology is an infant science, at once rash, fumbling and crude. As in all infant sciences, the universal habit of the human mind ‚Äì to take a partial or local truth, generalise it unduly and try to explain a whole field of Nature in its narrow terms ‚Äì runs riot here. Moreover, the exaggeration of the importance of suppressed sexual complexes is a dangerous falsehood and it can have a nasty influence and tend to make the mind and vital more and not less fundamentally impure than before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-203">It is true that the subliminal in man is the largest part of his nature and has in it the secret of the unseen dynamisms which explain his surface activities. But the lower vital subconscious which is all that this psycho-analysis of Freud seems to know, ‚Äì and even of that it knows only a few ill-lit corners, ‚Äì is no more than a restricted and very inferior portion of the subliminal whole. The subliminal self stands behind and supports the whole superficial man; it has in it a larger and more efficient mind behind the surface mind, a larger and more powerful vital behind the surface vital, a subtler and freer physical consciousness behind the surface bodily existence. And above them it opens to higher superconscient as well as below them to lower subconscient ranges. If one wishes to purify and transform the nature, it is the power of these higher ranges to which one must open and raise to them and change by them both the subliminal and the surface being. Even this should be done with care, not prematurely or rashly, following a higher guidance, keeping always the right attitude; for otherwise the force that is drawn down may be too strong for an obscure and weak frame of nature. But to begin by opening up the lower subconscious, risking to raise up all that is foul or obscure in it, is to go out of one's way to invite trouble. First, one should make the higher mind and vital strong and firm</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 51</p>
<p class="PE"> and full of light and peace from above; afterwards one can open up or even dive into the subconscious with more safety and some chance of a rapid and successful change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-204">The system of getting rid of things by <em>anubhava</em> <span class="note_0">[experience]</span> can also be a dangerous one; for on this way one can easily become more entangled instead of arriving at freedom. This method has behind it two well-known psychological motives. One, the motive of purposeful exhaustion, is valid only in some cases, especially when some natural tendency has too strong a hold or too strong a drive in it to be got rid of by <em>vicara</em> <span class="note_0">[intellectual reflection]</span> or by the process of rejection and the substitution of the true movement in its place; when that happens in excess, the sadhak has sometimes even to go back to the ordinary action of the ordinary life, get the true experience of it with a new mind and will behind and then return to the spiritual life with the obstacle eliminated or else ready for elimination. But this method of purposive indulgence is always dangerous, though sometimes inevitable. It succeeds only when there is a very strong will in the being towards realisation; for then indulgence brings a strong dissatisfaction and reaction, <em>vairagya</em>, and the will towards perfection can be carried down into the recalcitrant part of the nature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-205">The other motive for <em>anubhava</em> is of a more general applicability; for in order to reject anything from the being one has first to become conscious of it, to have the clear inner experience of its action and to discover its actual place in the workings of the nature. One can then work upon it to eliminate it, if it is an entirely wrong movement, or to transform it if it is only the degradation of a higher and true movement. It is this or something like it that is attempted crudely and improperly with a rudimentary and insufficient knowledge in the system of psycho-analysis. The process of raising up the lower movements into the full light of consciousness in order to know and deal with them is inevitable; for there can be no complete change without it. But it can truly succeed only when a higher light and force are sufficiently at work to overcome, sooner or later, the force of the tendency that is held up for change. Many, under the pretext of <em>anubhava</em>, not only raise up the adverse movement, but support it with their consent instead of rejecting it, find justifications for continuing or repeating it and so go on playing with it, indulging its return, eternising it; afterwards when they want to get rid of it, it has got such a hold that they find themselves helpless in its clutch and only a terrible struggle or an intervention of divine grace can liberate them.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 52</p>
<p class="PE"> Some do this out of a vital twist or perversity, others out of sheer ignorance; but in yoga, as in life, ignorance is not accepted by Nature as a justifying excuse. This danger is there in all improper dealings with the ignorant parts of the nature; but none is more ignorant, more perilous, more unreasoning and obstinate in recurrence than the lower vital subconscious and its movements. To raise it up prematurely or improperly for <em>anubhava</em> is to risk suffusing the conscious parts also with its dark and dirty stuff and thus poisoning the whole vital and even the mental nature. Always therefore one should begin by a positive, not a negative experience, by bringing down something of the divine nature, calm, light, equanimity, purity, divine strength into the parts of the conscious being that have to be changed; only when that has been sufficiently done and there is a firm positive basis, is it safe to raise up the concealed subconscious adverse elements in order to destroy and eliminate them by the strength of the divine calm, light, force and knowledge. Even so, there will be enough of the lower stuff rising up of itself to give you as much of the <em>anubhava</em> as you will need for getting rid of the obstacles; but then they can be dealt with with much less danger and under a higher internal guidance.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-206"><em>[Note: This Letter was published in the Letters on Yoga, Cent. Ed., XXIV.1605 ff.]</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-207">I find it difficult to take these psycho-analysts at all seriously when they try to scrutinise spiritual experience by the flicker of their torch-lights, ‚Äì yet perhaps one ought to, for half-knowledge is a powerful thing and can be a great obstacle to the coming in front of the true Truth. This new psychology looks to me very much like children learning some summary and not very adequate alphabet, exulting in putting their a-b-c-d of the subconscient and the mysterious underground super-ego together and imagining that their first book of obscure beginnings (c-a-t cat, t-r-e-e tree) is the very heart of the real knowledge. They look from down up and explain the higher lights by the lower obscurities; but the foundation of these things is above and not below, <em>upari budhna esam</em>. The superconscient, not the subconscient, is the true foundation of things. The significance of the lotus is not to be found by analysing the secrets of the mud from which it grows here; its secret is to be found in the heavenly archetype of the lotus that blooms for ever in the Light above. The self-chosen field of these psychologists is besides poor, dark and limited; you must know the whole before you can know the part and the highest before</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-224"><em>I'd like to ask you a question about those lines from Savitri I showed you the other day. I don't know if you remember ‚Äì the passage about the ‚Äúwhite gods.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-225">What did you want to ask? What was it that ‚Äúthe white gods had missed‚Äù? But Sri Aurobindo has written it all down in full, right here in the <em>Aphorisms</em>. He has mentioned everything, taken up one thing after another: ‚ÄúWithout this, there would not have been that; without this, there would not have been that...‚Äù and so on.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="28" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 55</p>
<p class="PE"> But I also remember reading <em>The Tradition</em>, before I met Sri Aurobindo (it was like a novel, a serialized romance of the world's creation, but it was very evocative; Th√©on called it <em>
The Tradition</em>). That was where I first learned of the universal Mother's first four emanations, when the Lord delegated his creative power to the Mother. And it was identical to the ancient Indian tradition, but told like a nursery story; anyone could understand ‚Äì it was an image, like a movie, and very vivid.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-226">So She made her first four emanations. The first was Consciousness and Light (arising from Sachchidananda); the second was Ananda and Love; the third was Life; and Truth was the fourth. Then, so the story goes, conscious of their infinite power, instead of keeping their connection with the supreme Mother and, through Her, with the Supreme, instead of receiving indications for action from Him and doing things in proper order, they were conscious of their own power and each one took off independently to do as he pleased ‚Äì they had power and they used it. They forgot their Origin. And because of this initial oblivion, Consciousness became unconsciousness, and Light became darkness; Ananda became suffering, Love became hate; Life became Death; and Truth became Falsehood. And they were instantly thrown headlong into what became Matter. According to Th√©on, the world as we know it is the result of that. And that was the Supreme himself in his first manifestation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-227">But the story is easy to understand, and quite evocative. On the surface, for intellectuals, it's very childish; but once you have the experience you understand it very well ‚Äì I understood and felt the thing immediately.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-228">And once the world has become like that, has become the vital world in all its darkness, and they, from this vital world, have created Matter, the supreme Mother sees <em>(laughing)</em> the result of her first four emanations and She turns towards the Supreme in a great entreaty: ‚ÄúNow that this world is in such a dreadful state, it has to be saved! We can't just leave it this way, can we? It has to be saved, the divine consciousness must be given back to it. What to do?‚Äù And the Supreme says, ‚ÄúThrust yourself into a new emanation, an emanation of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ESSENCE</span> of Love, down into the most material Matter.‚Äù That meant plunging into the earth (the earth had become a symbol and a representation of the whole drama). ‚ÄúPlunge into Matter.‚Äù So She plunged into Matter, and that became the primordial source of the Divine within material substance. And from there (as is so well described in <em>Savitri)</em>, She begins to act as a leaven in Matter, raising it up from within.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 56</p>
<p class="PE"> And as She plunged into the earth, a second series of emanations was sent forth ‚Äì the gods ‚Äì to inhabit the intermediary zones between Sachchidananda and the earth. And these gods <em>(laughing)</em>... well, great care was taken to make them perfect, so they wouldn't give any trouble! But they are a bit... a bit too perfect, aren't they? Yes, a bit too perfect: they never make mistakes, they always do exactly as they're told.... In short, rather lacking in initiative. They do have some, but....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-229">In fact, they were not <em>surrendered</em> in the way a psychic being can be, because they had no psychic in them. The psychic being is the result of that descent. Only human beings have it. And that's what makes humanity so superior to the gods. Th√©on insisted greatly on this: throughout his story, humans are far superior to gods and should not obey them ‚Äì they should only be in contact with the Supreme in his aspect of perfect Love.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-230">I don't know how to put it.... To me, those gods always seemed... (not those described in the Puranas, they're different... well, not so very different!) but the way Th√©on presented them, they seemed just like a bunch of marshmallows! It's not that they had no power ‚Äì they had a lot of power, but they lacked that psychic flame.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-231">And to Th√©on, the God of the Jews and Christians was an Asura. This Asura wanted to be unique; and so he became the most terrible despot imaginable. Anatole France said the same thing (I now know that Anatole France had never read Th√©on's story, but I can't imagine where he picked this up). It's in <em>The Revolt of the Angels</em>. He says that Satan is the true God and that Jehovah, the ‚Äúonly God,‚Äù is the monster. And when the angels wanted Satan to become the one and only God, Satan realized he was immediately taking on all Jehovah's failings! So he refused: ‚ÄúOh, no ‚Äì thank you very much!‚Äù It's a wonderful story, and in exactly the same spirit as what Th√©on used to say. The very first thing I asked Anatole France (I told you I met him once ‚Äì mutual friends introduced us), the first thing I asked him was, ‚ÄúHave you ever read <em>The Tradition?‚Äù</em> He said no. I explained why I had asked, and he was interested. He said his source was his own imagination. He had caught that idea intuitively.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-232">Well, if you speak this way to philosophers and metaphysicians, they'll look at you as if to say, ‚ÄúYou must be a real simpleton to believe all that claptrap!‚Äù But these things are not to be taken as concrete truths ‚Äì they are simply splendid images. Through them I really did come in contact, very concretely, with the truth of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 57</p>
<p class="PE">
what caused the world's distortion, much better than with all the Hindu stories, far more easily.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-233">Buddhism and all similar lines of thought took the shortest path: ‚ÄúThe desire to exist is what has caused all the trouble.‚Äù If the Lord had refrained from having this desire, there would have been no world! It's childish, very childish, really a much too human way of looking at the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-234">To see it from the angle of delight of being is qualitatively far superior, but then there's still the problem of why it all became the way it is. The usual reply is: because all things were possible, and this is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> possibility. But it's not a very satisfying feeling: ‚ÄúYes, all right, that's just the way it is, it's a fact.‚Äù People used to ask Th√©on too, ‚ÄúWhy did it happen like this? Why...?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait till you get to the other side, then you will know. And meanwhile do what's necessary to get there ‚Äì that's the most urgent thing.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-235">But there is one advantage: without those beings, without the world's distortion, many things would be lacking. Those beings potentially embodied certain absolutely unique elements ‚Äì understandably so, since they were the first wave. And precisely because they still <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WERE</span> the Supreme to such a great extent, each one felt he was the Supreme, and that was that. Only it wasn't quite sufficient, for the simple reason that they were already divided into four, and one single division is enough to make everything go wrong. It's readily understandable: it's not something essentially evil, but a question of wrong <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FUNCTIONING</span>; it's not the substance, not the essence. The essence isn't evil, but the functioning is faulty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-236">But if you understand....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-237">The words are so childish that if you tell this story to intelligent people, they look at you with pity ‚Äì but it gives such a concrete grasp of the problem! It helped me a lot.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-238">It was written in English and I am the one who translated it into French ‚Äì into horrible French, perfectly ghastly, because I put in all the new words Th√©on had dreamed up. He had made a detailed description of all the faculties latent in man, and it was remarkable ‚Äì but with such barbarous words! You can make up new words in English and get away with it, but in French it's utterly ridiculous. And there I was, very conscientiously putting them all in! Yet in terms of experience, it was splendid. It really was an experience ‚Äì it came from Madame Th√©on's experiences in exteriorization. She had learned what Th√©on also taught me, to speak while you're in the seventh heaven (the body goes on</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 58</p>
<p class="PE"> speaking, rather slowly, in a rather low voice, but it works quite well). She would speak and a friend of hers, another English woman who was their secretary, would note it all down as she went along (I think she knew shorthand). And afterwards it was made into stories, told as stories. It was all shown to Sri Aurobindo and it greatly interested him. He even adopted some of the words into his own terminology.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-239">The divisions and subdivisions of the being were described down to the slightest detail and with perfect precision. I went through the experience again on my own, without any preconceived ideas, just like that: leaving one body after the other, one body after the other, and so on twelve times.... And my experience ‚Äì apart from certain quite negligible differences, doubtless due to differences in the receiving brain ‚Äì was exactly the same.</p>
<p class="Q">(the clock strikes)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-240">I have to go....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-241">I don't know if those experiences have been described in traditional scriptures. I haven't read any ‚Äì I know nothing of Indian literature, nothing at all. I only know what Sri Aurobindo has said, plus a few odds and ends from here and there. And each time I found myself faced with their vocabulary... oh, it really puts you off!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-242"><em>You speak of exteriorization ‚Äì couldn't you show me a simple way of learning to do it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-243">You can't do it on your own, it's dangerous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-244">Some people do it spontaneously, so of course you're not going to tell them it's dangerous. But it is dangerous, because if they do it just like that, without being watched over, and someone or something abruptly calls them back ‚Äì some event, some circumstance or other ‚Äì they can be cut off <em>(gesture of the cord being cut)</em>. I would never let anyone without knowledge do it on his own. If it's spontaneous, it means it comes from previous existences, so they have the knack. But all the same it's a bit risky, someone should always be there to watch over your body. And as for teaching it to someone offhand ‚Äì no.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-245">I did try once in France ‚Äì with Hohlenberg, that painter who came here during the war <span class="note_0">[World War I]</span> and then had to go back.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="29" href="#">2</a></p>

<p class="PE"> He came to France and asked me. He absolutely insisted. He had read all Th√©on's stuff and was well up on everything and very anxious to try. So I taught him how to do it; and what's more, I was there, he did it in my presence. And, mon petit, the moment he went out of his body, he was thrown into a panic! The man was no coward ‚Äì he was very courageous ‚Äì but it absolutely terrified him! Sheer panic.... So I said no, no, no.</p>

<p class="PE"> aspect of her karma ‚Äì completely free. For I know the people around me and what they carry with them very well, and there was nothing ‚Äì just one thing remained, the one part that was rather constructive, so I had left that totally intact. And when the events of her past life were revealed to her, I took the greatest care to destroy the revelation as it was being given. And I did it ruthlessly. You see, it was like dumping a load of mud on someone completely unsullied, and I didn't let it happen (I couldn't stop what entered through her physical brain, but inwardly... I utterly annihilated it). The only thing I left untouched was the constructive part of the bond that had existed between you two, and so when she met you, she.... That's all I left, because it was good, pure, lovely ‚Äì it was good. But all the rest.... And you saw how strongly I protested when I was told she had committed suicide. ‚ÄúNo, no, no!‚Äù I said; even if somebody with perfect knowledge were to tell me so, I'd still say <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NO</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-262">She is untainted by all that ‚Äì pure ‚Äì and I won't stand for someone pure to be soiled.

To see the whole target, the all-inclusive Truth, you must cross to the other side. And when you do, what you see is not the sum of countless truths, an innumerable quantity of truths added together and viewed one after another, making it impossible to grasp the whole at a glance; when you go above, it's the whole you see first, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT A GLANCE</span>, in its entirety, without division. So there is no longer any choice to be made; it's a vision: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> is to be done. The choice is no longer between this and that, it doesn't work that way any more. Things are no longer seen in succession, one after another; there is rather a simultaneous vision of a whole that exists as a unit. The choice is simply a vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-297">As long as you're not in that state, you can't see the whole. The whole can't be seen successively, by adding one truth to another; this is precisely what the mind does, and why it is incapable of seeing the whole. It can't do it. The mind will always see things in succession, by addition, but that's not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IT</span>, something will always elude you ‚Äì the very sense of truth will elude you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-298">Only when you have a simultaneous, global perception of the whole as a unit can you see truth in its entirety.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-304">That's what I have been studying these past two days ‚Äì not for you in particular, but the general effect of japa, the reason for it in the organization of one's life.... I can't say I have made any discoveries (maybe for myself, I don't know); but my study is not on higher levels, it's right here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-305">It would take too long to give the details; I can summarize, but I don't want to make a doctrine, and for it to be living it's bound to be long.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-306">For some time now I have been running into difficulties with my morning japa. It's complex. I won't go into details, but certain things seemed to be trying to interfere, either preventing me from going on to the end, or plunging me into a kind of trance that brought everything to a halt. So I began wondering what it was and why. A very, very long curve was involved, but the result of my observations is the following. (All this is purely from the body's standpoint; I mean it doesn't concern the conscious, living, independent being that would remain the same even without the body ‚Äì to be exact, the being whose life, consciousness, freedom and action do not depend on the body. I am speaking here of that which needs the body for its manifestation; that alone was in question.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-307">There has been a kind of perception of a variety of bodily activities, a whole series of them, having to do exclusively (or so it seems) with the maintenance of the body. Some are on the borderline ‚Äì sleep, for instance: one portion of it is necessary for good maintenance of the body, and another portion puts it in contact with other parts and activities of the being; but one portion of sleep is exclusively for maintaining the body's balance. Then there is food, keeping clean, a whole range of things. And according to Sri Aurobindo, spiritual life shouldn't suppress those things; whatever is indispensable for the body's well-being must be kept up. For ordinary people, all other bodily activities are used for personal pleasure and benefit. The spiritual man, on the other hand, has given his body to serve the Divine, so that the Divine may use it for His work and perhaps, as Sri Aurobindo said, for His joy ‚Äì although given the present state of Matter and the body, that seems to me unlikely or at best very intermittent and partial, because this body is much more a field of misery than a field of joy. (None of this is based on speculation, but on personal experience ‚Äì I am</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 69</p>
<p class="PE"> relating my personal experience.) But with work, it's different: when the body is at work, it's in full swing. That's its joy, its need ‚Äì to exist only to serve Him. To exist only to serve. And of course, to reduce maintenance to a bare minimum while trying to find a way for the Divine to participate in the very restricted, limited and meager possibilities of joy this maintenance may give. To associate the Divine with all those movements and things, like keeping clean, sleeping (although sleep is different, it's already a lot more interesting); but especially with personal hygiene, eating and other absolutely indispensable things, the attempt is to associate them with the Divine Presence so that they may be as much an expression of divine joy as possible. (This is realized to a certain extent.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-308">Now where does japa fit into all this?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-309">Japa, like meditation, is a procedure ‚Äì apparently the most active and effective procedure ‚Äì for joining, as much as possible, the Divine Presence to the bodily substance. It is the magic of sound, you see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-310">Naturally, if there's also an awareness of the idea behind it, if one does japa as a very active <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSCIOUS</span> invocation, then its effects are greatly multiplied. But the basis is the magic of sound. This is a fact of experience, and it's absolutely true. The sound <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OM</span>, for instance, awakens very special vibrations (there are other such sounds as well, but of course that one is the most powerful of all).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-311">It is an attempt to divinize material substance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-312">From another, almost identical point of view, it fills the physical atmosphere with the Divine Presence. So time spent in japa is time consecrated to helping the material substance enter into more intimate rapport with the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-313">And if one adds to this, as I do, a mantric program, that is, a sort of prayer or invocation, a program for both personal development and helping the collective, then it becomes a truly active work. Then there's also what I call ‚Äúexternal‚Äù work: contact with others, reading and answering letters, seeing and speaking to people, and finally all the activities having to do with the organization and running of the Ashram (in meditation this work becomes worldwide, but physically, materially, it is limited for the moment to the Ashram).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-314">In the course of my observation, I also saw the position of X and people like him, who practically spend their lives doing japa, plus meditation, puja,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="34" href="#">4</a> ceremonies (I am talking only about sincere people, not fakers). Well, that's their way of working for the world, of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 70</p>
<p class="PE"> serving the Divine, and it seems the best way to them ‚Äì perhaps even the only way ‚Äì but it's a question of mental belief. In any case, it's obvious that even a bit of... not exactly puja, but some sort of ceremony that you set yourself to do ‚Äì habitual gestures symbolizing and expressing a particular inner state ‚Äì can also be a help and a way of offering yourself and relating to the Divine and thus serving the Divine. I feel it's important looked at in this way ‚Äì not from the traditional viewpoint, I can't stand that traditional viewpoint; I understand it, but it seems to me like putting a brake on true self-giving to the Divine. I am speaking of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SELF-IMPOSED</span> japa and rules (or, if someone gives you the japa, rules you accept with all your heart and adhere to). These self-imposed rules should be followed as a gesture of love, as a way of saying to the Divine, ‚ÄúI love You.‚Äù Do you see what I mean? Like arranging flowers in a certain way, burning incense, dozens of little things like that, made beautiful because of what is put into them ‚Äì it is a form of self-giving.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-315">Now, I think that doing japa with the will and the idea of getting something out of it spoils it a little. You spoil it. I don't much like it when somebody says, ‚ÄúDo this and you will get that.‚Äù It's true ‚Äì it's true, but it's a bit like baiting a fish. I don't much like it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-316">Let it be your own manner of serving the Divine, of relating to Him, loving Him, of joining Him to your physical life, being close to Him and drawing Him close to you ‚Äì that way it's beautiful. Each time you say the Word, let it be an invocation, let it be like the recitation of a word of love; then it's beautiful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-317">That's how I see it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-318">And so according to your mission in the world, you have to find for yourself the right proportion between this work and external, intellectual or organizational work; and then there are the body's needs, which can be met in the same way, trying to make it possible for the Lord to take delight in them. I have seen this for trivial things: for example, making your bath a pleasant experience, or caring for your hair, or whatever (of course, it's been a long time since there have been any of those stupid, petty ideas of personal pleasure), so that these things aren't done indifferently, out of habit and necessity, but... with a touch of beauty, a touch of charm and delight for the Lord.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-328">Yes, I have noticed that in the space of (I don't remember when we performed it,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="36" href="#">2</a> you were already here)... between then and now there is at least a good fifty years' difference ‚Äì a fifty-year change in consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-329">But in practice, I am always up against the same problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-330">Looking at it as a difference in attitude, the question is readily cleared up. But if I want the truth ‚Äì the true truth behind this difference, it becomes very difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-331">And that is exactly what I have seen in the light of the events described in <em>Perseus</em>. If you don't take the problem generally but specifically, down to the least detail.... But it evaporates as soon as you formulate it. Only when you feel it concretely, when you get a grip on it, can you grasp both things....</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 72</p>
<p class="PE"> The problem is roughly this: nothing exists that is not the result of the divine Will.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-332">Always the same problem. Always the same problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-333">Generally speaking, the antidivine is easily understood, but in the minute details of daily life, how do you choose between this and that?... What is the truth behind the thing you choose and the one you don't choose? And you know, my standpoint is totally beyond any question of egoistic, individual will ‚Äì that isn't the problem here. It's not that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-334">As soon as you try to say it, it evaporates.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-335">Yet it is something very, very acute.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-336">Of course, the explanation is universal progress, the Becoming: what must be and what ceases to be ‚Äì that's all very well; it's easy to understand in general terms.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-337">Perhaps the problem is the opposition (if it is an opposition) between two attitudes, both of which should express our relationship with the Supreme. One is the acceptance ‚Äì not only voluntary but perfectly content ‚Äì of everything, even the ‚Äúworst calamities‚Äù (what are conventionally called ‚Äúthe worst calamities‚Äù). I won't use this story as an example because it's self-explanatory, but if Andromeda were a yogi (with ‚Äúifs‚Äù you can build castles in the air, but I am trying to explain what I mean), she would accept the idea of death readily, easily. Well, it's precisely this conflict between an attitude quite ready to accept death (I am not talking about what happens in the story itself, but merely giving a case in point to make myself clear) because it is the divine Will, for this reason alone ‚Äì it's the divine Will, so it's quite all right; since that's how it is, it's quite all right ‚Äì and at the same time, the love of Life. This love of Life.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="37" href="#">3</a> Following the story, you would say: she lived because she had to live ‚Äì and everything is explained. But that's</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 73</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-338">Because things like that happen in the consciousness of.... It always bothers me to get into big ideas and big words, but to truly explain myself, I should say: the Universal Mother.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-339">Automatically, everything that exists is a natural expression of divine Joy, even the things human consciousness finds most horrifying ‚Äì this is understandable. But at the same time there is this aspiration, so intense that it's almost anguish, for a perfection of creation to come. And it does seem that this intense aspiration and anguish in the material world is a necessary preparation for this perfection to come. Yet at the same time, whatever exists is perfect at each moment, since it is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ENTIRELY</span> the Divine. There is nothing other than the Divine. So there is simultaneously this plenitude of Divine Joy in each second, in whatever exists, and the aspiration, the anguish ‚Äì and the difficulty lies in joining the two, there you have it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-340">Practically, you go from one to the other, or one is in front and the other behind, one active and the other passive. With the feeling of perfect joy comes an almost static state (certainly the joy of movement is also there, but all anticipation of the goal stays in the background). Then, when the aspiration of the Becoming is there, the joy of divine perfection at each moment withdraws into a static state.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-341">And this very going back and forth is the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-342">Perhaps that's how it must be, but it's unsatisfying ‚Äì very unsatisfying.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-343">At my fullest and most intense moments ‚Äì moments when truly what exists is the universe (by universe I mean the Becoming of the Supreme) with the utmost active awareness of the Supreme ‚Äì at such moments I am suddenly caught by that <span class="note_0">[the static, nirvanic aspect]</span>. It's not a matter of choosing between the two, but rather a question of priorities from the standpoint of action on the lowest level. Instinctively (the instinct of this body, this material base), the choice is aspiration, because this being was built for action; but this cannot be taken as an absolute rule, it's almost like a casual preference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-344">One feels that life Is this aspiration, this anguish, while bliss leads most naturally to the nirvanic side ‚Äì I don't know....</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 74</p>
<p class="PE"> But then how to help people?... You can recommend neither one nor the other. And if you say both, you are plunged into this same dilemma.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-345">A problem like that reaches a point of such acute tension that you feel you know nothing, understand nothing, you will never understand anything, it's hopeless. When I reach that point, I always tilt in the same direction, it's always: ‚ÄúAll right, I adore the Lord, as for the rest, it doesn't matter to me!‚Äù I enter into a... marvelous adoration... and let Him do what He wants! That's how it all ends up for me.</p>

It was really so absolute that helping others, making the world progress, spiritual life, seeking the Divine, all of that seemed idle talk, empty words! There was nothing in it, it was nothing, and there was nothing to understand, it was impossible to understand ‚Äì it was impossible to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BE</span>. The feeling of a total incapacity. The experience was like a solvent ‚Äì everything seemed to dissolve: the world, the earth, people, life, intelligence, all of it, everything was dissolved. An absolutely negative state. And my solution was the same as always: when the experience was total and complete, when nothing was left, then: ‚ÄúWho cares!‚Äù (it could really be put in the most ordinary words), ‚ÄúI adore You!‚Äù And the ‚ÄúI‚Äù was something utterly insubstantial: there was no form, no being, no</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-36"><sup>2</sup> The play was performed some eight years earlier, in December 1954.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-37"><sup>3</sup> In Sri Aurobindo's play, Andromeda, daughter of the King of Syria, is condemned by her own people to be devoured by Poseidon, the Sea-god, for some impiety she had committed against him. The story is actually about the passage of a half- primitive tribe, living in terror of the old dark and cruel gods, to a more evolved and sunlit stage. Perseus, son of Diana and Zeus, and protected by Pallas Athene, goddess of wisdom and intelligence, comes to deliver Andromeda from the rock she is chained to (the rock symbolizes the Inconscient for the Rishis), and founds the religion of Athene, ‚Äú...the Omnipotent/ Made from His being to lead and discipline/ The immortal spirit of man, till it attain/ To order and magnificent mastery/ Of all his outward world‚Äù (in the words of Sri Aurobindo). It is the force of progress pitted against the old priests of the old religions, symbolized by the cruel and ambitious Polydaon. Here Mother is scrutinizing an old problem ‚Äì ‚ÄúAlways the same problem‚Äù ‚Äì that she must have encountered in many existences (Egypt included) and would encounter again eleven years later: the acceptance of the death she is forced into as the Supreme's Will, and then this ‚Äúlove of Life‚Äù she twice mentions here.

<p class="PE"> <em>(After listening to Satprem read several Playground Talks<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="39" href="#">1</a> to be published in the Ashram Bulletin.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-398">It's easy reading, it won't tax their brains.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-399"><em>Still, it's worth saying.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-400">Actually, I have noticed one thing: nowadays if I spontaneously say something the way I see it, without trying to adapt myself to people, they don't understand ‚Äì it's difficult to understand. And I am not speaking of people who know nothing, but of those who have lived and thought with me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-401">My vision of things ‚Äì the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> things ‚Äì has become very, very different. Very different. When you read these Talks to me it's exactly as though I were listening to someone else saying things ‚Äì I am transported back into a different person's consciousness. But at least it's accessible, while now....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-402">At that time, I had the sense of a ‚Äúhigher way of living‚Äù: I used to make a distinction between different ways of life. Now this so-called higher way of living seems so miserable to me ‚Äì so petty, mean, narrow ‚Äì that I very often find myself in the same position as those who ask, ‚ÄúBut is there really something to it?‚Äù And I understand them (even though I have a different will and vision of something to come that is not yet here), I understand the feeling of those who came into contact with spiritual life and asked, ‚ÄúWhat good is it ‚Äì what good is it? Is there anything worth living in it?‚Äù We are <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NECESSARILY</span> hemmed in, bound to live in narrowness and pettiness simply to keep alive, for the sake of all the body's needs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-403">It takes such an effort to bring Light into this poverty, to bring a Force, a Reality, a Power, something, good Lord, something <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span>!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-404">In that former illusion, there were noble actions, generous actions, great, heroic actions, all adding color to life and capable of giving you some interesting hours. Now that too is gone: I see it all as childishness.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 80</p>
<p class="PE"> I understand very well that this present state is necessary for getting out of it. For as long as something seems normal, natural, acceptable, there's no escaping it. You have one life on the side and then ‚Äúthis‚Äù <span class="note_0">[the life in the body]</span>, that's the way people with a spiritual life always lived: they had their spiritual life and let ‚Äúthis‚Äù continue on automatically, without attaching any importance to it ‚Äì it's very easy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-405">But what a relief to live the Truth at each instant!...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-406">I haven't yet found the way.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-413">So the tendency is always to step back and go within. But that's not the way! It's a natural movement, but I clearly see that it's false.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-414">Both were there this morning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-415">Obviously a great, great deal of stability and inner calm is required.... There was a keen sense of the absolute pettiness, stupidity and dullness of all outer circumstances, of this whole bodily life in its external form, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT THE SAME TIME</span> a great symphony of divine joy. And both states were together like pulsations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-416">But it makes your head spin. You have to be very careful, it... <em>it makes you giddy!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-417">I can't express it ‚Äì the minute you try to express it, most of it evaporates. And even if I did tell what little I could, surely a good nine and a half people out of ten would say, ‚ÄúShe's batty!‚Äù If I spoke to the people here that way, they would probably say, ‚ÄúShe's soft in the head!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-418">Strange. This morning it was strange, for both were there: the feeling of physical weakness ‚Äì almost a physical decomposition ‚Äì and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT THE SAME TIME, SIMULTANEOUSLY</span> (not even one behind the other, but both together), a glory of divine splendor.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-419">Both together.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 81</p>
<p class="PE"> Both together.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-420">I always have the most acute experiences when I am getting ready to go down for the balcony <span class="note_0">[darshan]</span>. That's when they come, during the most prosaic part of daily life. When I am meditating or walking or even seeing someone, it's different: physical things fade away, they lose their significance. But in this case, it's when I am in the very midst of physical life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-421">It was odd this morning because on one side I felt (‚Äúone side‚Äù ‚Äì it's not even a side; I don't know how to explain, they are both together) the body was unwell, most unharmonious (someone in an ordinary consciousness would have said the body was ill, or at any rate very weak, very... not at all in good condition), and simultaneously, in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICAL SENSATION</span>: a glory! A marvelous glory of blissfulness, joy, splendor!... But how could the two be together?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-422">Really, you must stay perfectly, perfectly calm inside; externally, you do things, brush your teeth and so forth, but within you must keep very calm if you don't want to fall over.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="40" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-423"><em>But what prevents the two from joining?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-424">It's not a joining. It's not a joining: one is to replace the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-425">But the other....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-426">You see, it's like trying to alter the functioning of the organs. What is the process? Already the two are beginning to exist simultaneously.... What does it take for one to disappear and the other to remain on its own, changed?... Changed, because as it is now it wouldn't be enough to make the body function; the body wouldn't perform all the things it must perform, it would stay in a blissful state, delighting in its condition, but not for long ‚Äì it still has a lot of needs! That's the trouble. It will be very easy for those who come in one or two hundred years; they will only have to choose: not to belong to the old system any more or else to belong to the new.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="41" href="#">3</a> But now.... A stomach has got to digest, after all! Well, that will mean a new way of adapting to the forces of Nature, a new functioning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-427"><em>But for that to happen, some beings would have to prepare this new functioning.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 82</p>
<p class="PE"> Sometimes I wonder if it's not sheer folly to attempt it.... Shouldn't this body simply be left to dissolve and let others, better fit for the new functioning, be prepared? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-428">I don't know. No one has ever done this before, so there's no one to tell me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-429">So my solution is always the same: I am like this <em>(gesture of surrender)</em>, the body saying, ‚ÄúI am quite willing to try, I am trying my best.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-430">Is it folly, or is it really possible?... I don't know.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-432">I believe so. I believe so.</p>

<p class="PE"> night for hours ‚Äì two hours of my night, at least ‚Äì not joined to him, with him: like someone I see and talk to and who talks to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-443">Again last night....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-444">And he purposely doesn't want me to note down what he says. For I could do so (if I had time) very early in the morning; I remember very, very clearly and precisely. Later it fades, it's erased... only the impression or influence remains and it's very strong all day until it's replaced by another. This creates a sort of atmosphere in which I live, an atmosphere of knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-445">But he doesn't want me to note it down. It's not simply that I don't have the time, he doesn't want me to. When I wake up (not ‚Äúwake up,‚Äù when I come out of that state), there are no lapses of consciousness. This is something I have acquired through lifelong discipline ‚Äì I have no lapses. Things don't suddenly go away, poof! They remain very clear ‚Äì I go from one state to another with no impression of a gap. But I see his action: he replaces the precise memory of what has been said and done by a sort of atmosphere, a sensation that stays with me all day long.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-446">Sometimes a particular image lingers, as a key to the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-447">It was so lovely last night!... We had come upon a region all mantled in snow, pure white, and all the arctic animals were there. He wore a white robe. I walked by his side, and he began to repeat my mantra, saying, ‚ÄúSee how it is....‚Äù Glorious!</p>

<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-450">It may come... if I am given the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-451">Oh, it's people's thoughts that are so annoying! Everybody, everybody is constantly thinking about old age and death, and death and old age and illness... oh, they're such a nuisance! Me, I never think of it. That's not the question. The difficulty lies in the Work itself; it doesn't depend on a certain number of years, which besides is completely... it's nothing, one second in eternity, a mere nothing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-452">But truly, if someone (I don't know who or what this ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äù is)... if I am given the time, I will know ‚Äì I am convinced of it.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 84</p>
<p class="PE"> For despite all the growing difficulties, there is also a growing knowledge, a constant progress.

<p class="PE"> It was that or else, as I often thought, some necessary preparation for the work ‚Äì something that had to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-478">It touched all the parts of my body and all the workings of the organs in succession ‚Äì very, very methodically.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-479">But is it necessary? Is all this disorganization necessary? Perhaps I call it disorganization when it isn't.... You know, we are totally ignorant in that realm. We have our old human ways of seeing, but when it comes to the body's functioning, we know nothing about what's good or not. Or even what's painful or not: the body's initial impulse is to feel the pain, but upon reflection and attentive observation, we see it is simply an intensity of sensation we're not used to. So it could well have been that. And if we were used to it (and especially if we didn't think of it as something troublesome), we would feel quite differently about it. In any case, it's not something unbearable ‚Äì we can bear a lot of things, much more than we imagine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-480">I am not sure, you see. We keep going on with old notions, old routines and old habits ‚Äì what can we possibly know!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-481">Anyway, this thing had to follow its course and wind up somewhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-482">I should mention that three or four days before my birthday something apparently very troublesome happened<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="52" href="#">5</a> (it could have been troublesome, anyway), and it made me wonder: ‚ÄúWill I be able to do what I have to on the 21st?‚Äù I wasn't happy about it. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI can't let these people down when they're expecting so much from this day; that's not right.‚Äù So throughout the 20th I stayed exclusively concentrated in a very, very deep, very interiorized invocation, not in the least superficial, far from all emotions and sentiments ‚Äì something really at the summit of the being. And I remained in contact with That, for everything to be truly for the best, free from any false movement in Matter whatsoever. And that night I was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CLEARLY</span> cured; I mean I followed the action and saw myself really and truly cured. When I got up in the morning, I got up cured. All the things I constantly had to do, all the tapasyas just <em>to keep going</em>, were no longer necessary ‚Äì someone had taken charge of everything, and it was all over and done with. And on the morning of the 21st, with a crowd of two thousand and some hundred people, it went perfectly smoothly, without the slightest hitch. Then in the afternoon I had that very special experience for my legs.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 88</p>
<p class="PE"> So on the 21st morning I could say quite spontaneously and unhesitatingly, ‚ÄúToday the Lord has given me the gift of healing me.‚Äù (I was speaking in English about the things people had given me, and I said, ‚Äú...and the Lord has given me the gift of healing me.‚Äù)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-483">This explanation is clear; and the healing was the result of tapasya. It's self-explanatory. Something was even saying to my body, to the body's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SUBSTANCE</span>, ‚ÄúO unbelieving substance, now you won't be able to say there are no miracles.‚Äù Throughout all the work that was being done on the 20th, something was saying (I don't know who, because it doesn't come like something foreign to me any more, it's like a Wisdom, it seems like a Wisdom, something that knows: not someone in particular, but ‚Äúthat which knows,‚Äù whatever its form), something that knows was insisting to the body, by showing it certain things, vibrations, movements, ‚ÄúFrom now on, O unbelieving substance, you can't say there are no miracles.‚Äù Because the substance itself is used to each thing having its effect, to illnesses following a particular course and certain things even being necessary for it to be cured. This process is very subtle, and it doesn't come from the intellect, which can have a totally different interpretation of it; it's rather a kind of consciousness ingrained in physical substance, and that's what was being addressed and being shown certain movements, certain vibrations and so forth: ‚ÄúYou see, from now on you can't say there are no miracles.‚Äù In other words, a direct intervention of the Lord, who doesn't follow the beaten path, but does things... in His own way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-484">There was also that attack (it was rather serious and threw the doctor into a fit of anxiety) which took place, I think, the day before sari distribution.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="53" href="#">6</a> The next morning, throughout the distribution, someone else seemed to have taken possession of my body and to be doing what had to be done, taking care of all the difficulties; I was comfortable, serene, simply like a carefree spectator. I had nothing to worry about, someone was.... (What ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù? Someone, something, I don't know, there's no more difference, it's not delineated like that any more; but anyway, it was a being, a force, a consciousness ‚Äì perhaps a part of myself, I don't know; none of this is clear-cut; it's quite precise, but not divided, very <em>smooth</em> 
‚Äì <em>Mother makes a rounded gesture</em> ‚Äì no breaks.) Something, then, a will or a force or a consciousness ‚Äì plainly a power ‚Äì had taken possession of the body and was doing all the work, looking after everything. I was witnessing everything, smiling. But it's gone now.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 89</p>
<p class="PE"> It came specifically for that work (I was in pretty bad shape); when the work was over, it dissolved ‚Äì it didn't leave abruptly but it became inactive. Afterwards, I felt rather confident. ‚ÄúWell in any case,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúsomething similar could happen on the 21st, since it just happened now.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-485">The 19th was so-so, and on the 20th I was concentrated all day long: no contacts with anyone, nothing external, only an intense invocation... as intense and concentrated as when you're trying to melt into the Lord at death. It was like that. The same movement of identification, but at its core a will for everything to work out in a good way here <span class="note_0">[on the material plane]</span>. ‚ÄúIn a good way‚Äù... I mean I said to the Lord, ‚Äú<span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">YOUR</span> Good, the true Good, not.... The true Good, a victorious Good, a real progress over the way life is usually lived.‚Äù And I stayed in this unwavering concentration the whole day, all the time, all the time: even when I spoke, it was something very external speaking. And then at night when I went to bed I felt something had changed ‚Äì the body felt completely different. When I got up in the morning, all the pains and disorders and dangers had... vanished. ‚ÄúLord,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúYou have given me a gift of health....‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-486">And with this change, the bodily substance, the very stuff of the cells, was constantly being told, ‚ÄúDon't you forget, now you see that miracles <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CAN</span> happen.‚Äù In other words, the way things work out in physical substance may not at all conform to the laws of Nature. ‚ÄúDon't forget, now!‚Äù It kept coming back like a refrain: ‚ÄúDon't forget, now! This is how it is.‚Äù And I saw how necessary this repetition was for the cells: they forget right away and try to find explanations (oh, how stupid can you be!). It's a sort of feeling (not at all an individual way of thinking), it's Matter's way of thinking. Matter is built like that, it's part of its make-up. We call it ‚Äúthinking‚Äù for lack of a better word, but it's not ‚Äúthinking‚Äù: it is a material way of understanding things, the way Matter is able to understand.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-495">Are these the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù figures?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-499">I did it myself for years, using the same system: inhale, hold, exhale, remain empty. But holding the lungs empty is said to be dangerous, so I don't advise it. I did it for years. Without knowing it, Sri Aurobindo and I did it nearly the same way, along with all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be done! This is to tell you that the danger is mainly in what you think. In the course of certain movements, both of us made the air go out through the crown of the head ‚Äì apparently that's only to be done when you want to die! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> It didn't kill us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-500">No, the ‚Äúdanger‚Äù is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MAINLY</span> a thought formation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-501">You can achieve excellent control of the heart. But I never practiced it violently, never strained myself. I think holding for 16 is too long. I used to do it simply like this: breathe in very slowly to the count of 4, then hold for 4 like this (I still have the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 91</p>
<p class="PE"> knack of it!), lifting the diaphragm and lowering the head<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">8</a> <em>(Mother bends her neck)</em>, closing everything and exerting pressure (this is an almost instantaneous cure for hiccups ‚Äì it's handy!). Then while I held the air, I would make it circulate with the force (because it contained force, you see) and with the peace as well; and I would concentrate it wherever there was a physical disorder (a pain or something wrong somewhere). It's very effective. The way I did it was: inhale, hold, exhale and empty ‚Äì you are completely empty. It's very useful; very handy for underwater swimmers, for instance!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-502">I had trouble breathing in slowly enough ‚Äì that's a bit hard. I began with 4 and eventually managed to do 12. I did 12-12-12-12. It took me months to reach that, it can't be done quickly. To breathe in very slowly and hold all that air isn't easy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-503">Now I have lost the knack, I can barely do more than 6 <em>(Mother demonstrates)</em>. I count: 1-2-3-4... no quicker.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-504">And exhale slowly ‚Äì that's very difficult ‚Äì being careful to empty the top part of the lungs, because air often stagnates there. This seems to be one of the most frequent causes of coughs and colds. When I had bronchitis I learned to empty the air out completely.

<p class="PE"> it up more than anything. But if you do it simply as a help to your progress, there's no danger.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-513">At any rate, Sri Aurobindo and I both did a lot of things considered dangerous, and absolutely nothing happened to us. Not that it's necessary to do dangerous things, but nothing happened to us, so it all depends on how you do them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-514">I think you can safely forget about this formation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-515">But instead of doing equal amounts of time, it might be better to do less for inhaling and more for holding the breath. The holding part is extremely interesting! When the air is inside, let's say you have a headache or a sore throat or a pain in your arm, anything ‚Äì then you take the air... <em>(Mother demonstrates)</em> and direct it to the unwell part... very, very helpful and pleasant and interesting.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-535">It's very interesting, but it means at least eight pages!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-536">Premonitory dreams....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-537">There are different kinds of premonitory dreams. Some are immediately realized ‚Äì you dream at night what will happen the next day ‚Äì while the realizations of others are staggered over varying spans of time; such dreams are seen in different realms corresponding to the time they take to be realized.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-538">The closer you approach absolute certainty, the greater is the time span, because the realm of such visions is quite close to the Origin, and a long time can pass between the revelation of what will be and its realization. But being so near the Origin, the revelation is very certain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-539">When one is identified with the Supreme, there is a place where all is unequivocally known: in the past, in the present, in the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="PE"> future and everywhere. But when they return, those who go there usually forget what they have seen. A particularly strict discipline is needed to remember. That's the only realm where you can't be mistaken.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-540">But the links of communication are seldom all there, so one rarely remembers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-541">Anyway, to go back to what I was saying, depending on the plane of one's vision, one can judge approximately how much time it will take to be realized. Immediate things are already realized, they are self-existent and can be seen in the subtle physical ‚Äì they already exist there, and the reflection (not even transcription) or projection of this image is what will take place in the material world the next day or a few hours later. In this case you see the thing accurately, in all its details, because it's already there. Everything hinges on the precision and power of your vision: if your vision is objective and sincere, you will see the thing as it is; if you add personal sentiments or impressions, it gets colored. Accuracy in the subtle physical depends exclusively on the instrument, the one who sees.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-542">But as soon as you move into a subtler realm, like the vital (and the mental even more so), there is a narrow margin of possibilities. You can see the rough outlines of what is going to take place, but in the details it can be this way or that way: it is possible for certain wills or influences to interfere and create discrepancies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-543">This is so because the original Will is reflected, as it were, in different realms, and in each realm the organization and relation of the images are changed. The world we live in is a world of images ‚Äì not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> thing itself in its essence, but its reflection. We could say that in our material existence we are merely a reflection, an image of what we are in our essential reality. And the modalities of these reflections are what introduce all the errors and all the falsifications (what is seen in its essence is perfectly true and pure, existing from all eternity, while images are essentially variable). And according to the amount of falsehood introduced into the vibrations, the amount of distortion and alteration increases. Each circumstance, each event and each thing can be said to have one pure existence ‚Äì its true existence ‚Äì and a considerable number of impure or distorted existences in the various realms of being. There is a substantial beginning of distortion, for instance, in the intellectual realm (indeed, the mental realm holds a considerable amount of distortion), and it increases as all the emotional and censorial realms interfere. Arriving at the material plane, the vision is most often 
unrecognizable. Completely distorted. To such a point that it's</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 96</p>
<p class="PE"> sometimes very hard to realize that ‚Äúthis‚Äù is the material expression of ‚Äúthat‚Äù ‚Äì there's not much resemblance any longer!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-544">This approach to the problem is rather new and can provide the key to many things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-545">Take the case of someone you know well and are used to seeing materially: seeing him in the subtle physical, certain aspects become more prominent, more visible, more marked; physically they went unseen because in the material grayness they had blended with many other things. Certain character traits that never showed up physically now become so marked as to be quite visible. When you look at someone physically, you see the color of his complexion, the shape of his features, his expression.... Seeing him at the same moment in the subtle physical, you suddenly notice different colors on different parts of the face, in the eyes an expression or a particular light you hadn't seen before ‚Äì a strong impression of a very different overall appearance, which to our physical eyes would seem rather outlandish. But for the subtle vision it's all very expressive and revealing of the person's character, or even of the influences he's under (what I am talking about is something I observed a few days ago).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-546">So, according to the plane where you are conscious and can see, you perceive images and see events from varying distances and with varying degrees of accuracy. The only true and sure vision is the vision of the Divine Consciousness. The problem, therefore, is to become conscious of the Divine Consciousness and constantly maintain it in all life's details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-547">Meanwhile, there are all sorts of ways to receive 
indications. That exact, precise and... (what's the word?) habitual vision 
certain people have may stem from various sources. It may be a vision through 
identity with circumstances and things when you have learned to expand your 
consciousness. It may be an indication from some chatterbox of the invisible 
world, who has got it into his head to let you know what's going to happen ‚Äì 
this is often the case. Then everything depends on your ‚Äúharbinger's‚Äù morals: if 
he is having fun at your expense, he spins stories for you ‚Äì this almost always 
happens to those who receive their information from entities. To bait you, they 
may repeatedly tell you how things are going to turn out (for they have a 
universal vision in some vital or mental realm); then, when they are sure you 
trust them, they may start telling you fibs and, as they say in English, <em>you make a fool of yourself</em>. This happens frequently! You have to be in a higher consciousness than these fellows, these entities (or these minor gods, as some call them) and able to check from above the value of their statements.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="PE"> With a universal mental vision, you can see (and this is very interesting) how the mental world operates to get realized on the physical plane. You see the various mental formations, how they converge, conflict, combine and relate to one another, which ones get the upper hand, exert a stronger influence and achieve a more total realization. Now, if you really want a higher vision, you must get out of the mental world and see the original wills as they descend to take expression. In this case, you may not have all the details, but the central <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FACT</span>, the fact in its central truth, is indisputable, undeniable, absolutely correct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-548">Some people also have the faculty of predicting things already existing on earth but at a distance, far from physical eyes ‚Äì they're generally those who have the capacity to expand and extend their consciousness. Their vision is slightly more subtle than physical vision, and depends on an organ subtler than its purely material counterpart (what could be called the ‚Äúlife‚Äù of this organ). So, by projecting their consciousness, and having the will to see, they can clearly see things that already exist but are beyond our ordinary field of vision. Those who have this capacity ‚Äì sincere people who tell what they see, not bluffers ‚Äì see with perfect precision and exactness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-549">Ultimately, absolute sincerity is the great deciding factor for those who predict or foresee. Unfortunately, because of people's curiosity, their insistence and the pressure they exert (which very few can resist), an almost involuntary mechanism of inner imagination comes to add just that small missing element to something not seen with precision or exactness. That's what causes flaws in prediction. Very few have the courage to say, ‚ÄúAh no, I don't know this, I don't see that, this eludes me.‚Äù They don't even have the courage to say it to themselves! So then, with a tiny drop of imagination, which acts almost subconsciously, the vision or information gets rounded out ‚Äì it can turn out to be anything at all! Very few people can resist this tendency. I have known many, many psychics, many extraordinarily gifted beings, and only a handful were able to stop just at the point where their knowledge stopped. Or else they embellish. That's what gives these faculties their slightly dubious quality. One would have to be a great saint, a great sage, and completely free from other people's influences (I don't speak of those who seek fame: they fall into the most flagrant traps); because even goodwill ‚Äì wanting to satisfy people, please them, help them ‚Äì is enough to distort the vision.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-551"><em>I'm tempted to ask one question.... Once events are already prepared in the subtle physical and one sees them, is it too late to alter their course? Can one still act?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-552">There's one very interesting example I always give. The man involved told me about it himself. A long time ago (you must have been a baby), every day the newspaper <em>Le Matin</em> published a small cartoon of a boy dressed like a <em>lift</em> attendant (he told me the story in English), or a sort of bellboy, pointing with his finger to the date or whatever. This man was traveling and staying at a big hotel in some city (I don't remember which), a big city. And he told me that one night or early one morning he had a dream: he saw this bellboy showing him a hearse (you know, what they use in Europe for taking people to the cemetery) and inviting him to step inside! He saw that. And when he got ready that morning and left his room (which was on the top floor) there on the landing was... the same boy, identically dressed, inviting him to go down in the elevator. It gave him a shock. He refused: ‚ÄúNo, thanks!‚Äù The elevator fell to the ground. It was smashed to pieces, and the people inside were all killed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-553">After this, he said, he believed in dreams!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-554">It was a vision. He saw the bellboy, but instead of the elevator, the boy showed him his hearse. Then, when he saw the same boy making the very same gesture (really just like the cartoon), he said, ‚ÄúNo, thanks! I'll walk down.‚Äù And the elevator (a hydraulic one) broke. It crashed down, crushing all those inside it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-555">He asked me about it and my explanation was that an entity had forewarned him. The image of the bellboy indicates an intelligent, conscious intermediary ‚Äì it doesn't seem to come from the man's subconscient.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="57" href="#">1</a> Or else he had seen it in the subtle physical and his subconscient knew ‚Äì but then why did it present him with such an image? I don't know. Perhaps something in his subconscient knew, because the accident already existed in the subtle physical. Before it occurred here, the accident ‚Äì ‚Äúthe law of the accident‚Äù ‚Äì existed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-556">Of course, in every case there is invariably a time-lag, sometimes a few hours (that's the maximum), sometimes a few seconds. Quite frequently things announce their presence, but to come in contact with your consciousness, it may take them a couple of minutes or just seconds. I am constantly, constantly aware of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 99</p>
<p class="PE"> what's going to happen ‚Äì utterly uninteresting things, as a matter of fact; knowing them in advance changes nothing. But they exist all around us, and with a wide enough consciousness we can know it all. For example, I know that so and so is going to bring me a parcel, that someone is about to come, and so forth. And it's like this every day. Because my consciousness is spread far and wide ‚Äì it comes into contact with things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-557">But the thing already exists, so it can't be called a premonition; it's just that to come true for us it needs a few seconds to make contact with our senses, because a door or a wall or something prevents us from seeing it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-558">I've had many such experiences. Once I was walking along a mountain path wide enough only for one: on one side, a precipice, on the other, sheer rock. Three children were behind me and a fourth person brought up the rear. I was in the lead. The path skirted the rock so you couldn't see what lay ahead. It was quite dangerous, besides: one slip and you fell off the cliff. I was walking in front when suddenly, with other eyes than these (yet I was carefully watching my steps), I saw a snake lying on the rocks around the bend. Waiting. I took one soft step and a snake was actually there! This spared me the shock of surprise (because I had seen it and was advancing cautiously), and as there was no shock of surprise, I could say to the children without scaring them, ‚ÄúStop, be quiet, don't move.‚Äù A shock might have caused a mishap ‚Äì the snake had heard us and was already on the defensive, coiled before his hole, head swaying ‚Äì a viper. It was in France. Nothing happened, but with confusion and commotion, who knows?...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-559">This type of thing has happened to me very, very often ‚Äì four times with snakes. There was one incident here near the fishing village of Ariankuppam, a place where a river empties into the sea. Night had fallen swiftly, it was pitch dark, and I was walking along a road when right in the middle of a step (I had already lifted my foot and was about to lower it), I distinctly heard a voice in my ear: ‚ÄúWatch out!‚Äù Yet no one had spoken. So I looked, and just as my foot was about to touch the ground, I saw an enormous black cobra right where I was casually going to put my foot. Those fellows don't like that sort of thing! It slithered away and swam across the water ‚Äì what a beauty, mon petit! Hood wide open, head held high, he swam across like a king. I would certainly have been punished for my impertinence!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-560">I have had hundreds and hundreds of experiences like that ‚Äì informed just at the last moment (not one second too soon) ‚Äì and in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 100</p>
<p class="PE"> very different circumstances. Once in Paris I was crossing the Boulevard Saint Michel (I had resolved to attain union with the psychic presence, the inner Divine, within a certain number of months, and these were the last weeks ‚Äì I was thinking of nothing but that, engrossed in that alone). I lived near the Luxembourg Gardens and was going there for a stroll, to sit in the gardens that evening ‚Äì still indrawn. I came to a kind of intersection ‚Äì not a very sensible place to cross when you're interiorized! So, in that state, I started to cross when all of a sudden I had a shock, as if something had hit me, and I instinctively jumped back. As I jumped back a streetcar rushed by. I had felt the streetcar at a little more than arm's length. It had touched my aura, the protective aura (that aura was very strong at the time ‚Äì I was deep into occultism and knew how to maintain it). My protective aura was touched, and it literally threw me backwards, just like a physical shock. Accompanied by the driver's insults!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-561">I leapt back just in time, and the streetcar passed by.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-562">There are loads of stories I could tell ‚Äì but I don't remember any more right now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-563">It can happen in different ways. Quite often I was informed by a small entity or some being or other. Sometimes the aura protected me ‚Äì all sorts of things. My life was rarely limited to the physical body. And this is useful, it's good. Necessary also ‚Äì it enhances your capacities. Th√©on told me right from the start: ‚ÄúYou people deprive yourselves of the most useful kind of senses, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVEN FOR ORDINARY LIFE</span>.‚Äù If you develop your inner senses (he gave them fabulous names), you can.... And it's true, absolutely true, we can know infinitely more than we normally do, merely by using our own senses. And not only mentally but vitally and even physically as well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-564"><em>But what is the method?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-565">Oh, the method is quite easy! There are various disciplines. It depends on what you want to achieve.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-566">It depends. Each thing has its method. But the primary method is to want it, to make a decision. Then you are given a description of all these senses and how they function ‚Äì that's a lengthy process. You choose one sense (or several), perhaps the one for which you have the greatest initial aptitude, and you decide. Then you follow the discipline. It's similar to doing exercises for developing muscles. You can even manage to create willpower in yourself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-567">For the subtler senses, the method is to create an exact image of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 101</p>
<p class="PE"> what you want, make contact with the corresponding vibration and then concentrate and practice. For instance, you practice seeing through an object, or hearing through a sound<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="58" href="#">2</a> or seeing at a distance. As an example, I was once bedridden for several months, which I found quite boring ‚Äì I wanted to see. I was staying in one room and beyond that room was another little room and after that a sort of bridge; in the middle of the garden the bridge changed into a stairway going down into a very spacious and beautiful studio built in the middle of the garden.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="59" href="#">3</a> I wanted to go see what was happening in the studio ‚Äì I was bored stiff in my room! So I stayed very still, shut my eyes and gradually, gradually sent out my consciousness. I did the exercise regularly, day after day, at a set hour. You begin with your imagination, and then it becomes a fact. After a while, I distinctly sensed my vision physically moving: I followed it and saw things going on downstairs I knew absolutely nothing about. I would verify it in the evening, asking, ‚ÄúDid it happen like this? Was that how it was?‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-568">But each of these things must be practiced for months, patiently, almost stubbornly. You take the senses one after another: hearing, sight, and eventually even the subtle aspects of taste, smell and touch.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-569">It's easier with the mind because we are more used to concentrating there. When you want to reflect and find a solution to something, instead of using mental deduction, you stop everything, focus on the idea or problem, and then concentrate, concentrate, intensifying the crux of the problem. You stop everything and wait until, through sheer intensity of concentration, a response comes. Learning that also demands a little time; but if you were ever a good student you have something of the aptitude ‚Äì it's not so very difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-570">There's a kind of extension of the physical senses. In American Indians, for instance, the senses of hearing and smell are far more extended than ours (in dogs too!). When I was eight or ten years old, I had an Indian friend who came with Buffalo Bill in the days of the Hippodrome ‚Äì that was a long time ago, I was around</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="PE"> eight. He was so sharp that he could put his ear to the ground and tell, from the intensity of the vibrations, how far the sound of footsteps was coming from. All the children immediately said, ‚ÄúI'd really like to know how to do that!‚Äù And so you try....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-571">That's how you prepare yourself. You think you're just having fun, but you are preparing yourself for later.</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 107</p>
<p class="PE"> This in itself has to be conquered; I mean, the state in itself represents something to be conquered. Because... you remember, I told you the other day about having such a tremendous experience in the body-consciousness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="61" href="#">1</a> ‚Äì this... this <em>dull</em> consciousness in the material world, which really gives the feeling of something inert, unchanging, incapable of responding; you could wait millions and millions of years and nothing would budge. And that experience came at the end of a rather critical passage ‚Äì it takes catastrophes to get it moving, that's what's so strange! And not only that, but the wisp of imagination it does have (if you can call it imagination) is invariably catastrophic. Whatever it anticipates is always for the worst ‚Äì the pettiest, meanest, nastiest kind of worst ‚Äì always the worst. It's... really, it's the most sickening condition human consciousness and matter can be in. Well, I have been swimming in it for months, and my way of being in it is to go through every possible illness and to have every possible physical aggravation, one after another.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-600">Just recently, as I told you, things truly became a little... disgusting, dangerous, and for an hour or an hour and a half I did a sadhana like this <em>(Mother clenches her fists)</em>, keeping hold of this body and body-consciousness. And the whole time the Force was at work there (it was like kneading a very resistant dough), something was saying to me, ‚ÄúLook, you can't deny miracles any longer.‚Äù It was being said to this consciousness (not to me, of course), this body-consciousness: ‚ÄúNow you can't deny it ‚Äì miracles do happen.‚Äù It was forced to see; there it was, gaping like an idiot being shown the sky ‚Äì ‚ÄúAh!‚Äù And it's so stupid that it didn't even have any joy of discovery! But it was forced to see, the thing was right under its nose ‚Äì there was no escaping it, it had to be admitted. But you know what, mon petit, as soon as I let up on the pressure ‚Äì forgotten!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-601">I remember the whole experience, of course, but the body-consciousness forgot. The slightest difficulty, even the shadow or the recollection of a difficulty, was enough for it to start up all over again: ‚ÄúOh... oh! Now what's going to happen?‚Äù The same old anxieties and stupidities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-602">So I realize that we have to keep on trying.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-603">What's annoying, though, is that in order to shake it all up, I have to go through some pretty bad moments physically. So don't worry, I understand how it is for others! I myself never lose either</p>

<p class="PE"> consciousness or contact with... not with Knowledge, but with the total <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EXPERIENCE</span> of identification.

So I understand how it is for people who live heedlessly from day to day, from minute to minute, for whom it's not a constant, permanent work of each second, totally conscious and deliberate.... And besides, this body is so willing ‚Äì the poor thing, sometimes I have found it crying like a child, imploring, ‚ÄúHow do you get out of this mess?‚Äù That's exactly why all the people who have achieved the inner realization have called this work ‚Äúimpossible.‚Äù It's their own impossibility! I know it's not impossible, I know it will come, but... how long will it take? That I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-604">My feeling is that if you try to hurry, to rush, to speed things up a little, it jams, it becomes like stone ‚Äì it turns to stone again. It took the stone a long time to become a man.... So I don't want that. You can't get too impatient ‚Äì it's not even impatience, but pressure. Beyond a certain pressure, it turns to stone. So I understand people who attain realization and, blissfully enjoying it, kick the whole thing out: ‚ÄúFine, I'll do without it!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-605">That's what has always happened.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-606">But I can't do that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-607">What I always do is say, ‚ÄúWell, all right...‚Äù (I say this to the Lord with a smile), ‚Äúif You have now decided I should leave, I'll go willingly.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-608">If He ever gave me a slap, that's when I'd get one! I can feel it even while I am saying this.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-609">It's simply to ensure that the consciousness is in a state of perfect equanimity; I mean, whether things turn out like this or like that leaves me completely indifferent: what You will ‚Äì spontaneously and integrally and exclusively ‚Äì My Will. I say ‚ÄúMy‚Äù Will on purpose, to show total adhesion. It's not submission, it has nothing to do with submission; it's like this <em>(gesture of total abandonment)</em>. Well, in spite of that, there's not much progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-610">Although sometimes, yes, all of a sudden.... Take this example (it may seem a mere trifle, but when you have reached this point...): the first sudden glimmer of conscious control over a bodily functioning, giving you a glimpse of the time when everything will function through the action of a conscious will. That has begun ‚Äì but it's a tiny, tiny, tiny beginning. And the slightest mental intrusion from the old movement spoils it all ‚Äì I mean the old way of behaving with your body: you want this and you want that and you want to make it do this and you want to make it.... The</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 109</p>
<p class="PE"> minute that pops up, everything stops. Progress comes to a standstill. One must be in a state of beatific union... then one can feel the new functioning begin.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-611">But it has become such a delicate play! A <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MINUTE</span> thing, minute, can throw everything out of gear ‚Äì one simple ordinary movement. If through habit you slip back into the ordinary functioning (these are infinitesimal things, not easily seen, subtle, tenuous; one must be very, very, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> alert), if this happens, the whole new thing stops. Then you have to wait. Wait until the ordinary functioning consents to stop, and that means meditating, entering into contemplation ‚Äì going over the whole path again. Then, when you have caught hold of That again and can stay there for a few seconds, sometimes a few minutes (it's marvelous when it lasts a few minutes).... And then it gets jammed again and everything has to be done over.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-612">I am not saying this to discourage you, but to tell you that one must really and truly be patient. The only possible way to do it is in a sort of passivity: not to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WANT</span> the result ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WANTING</span> the result brings in an ego movement which spoils it all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-613">I have been telling you for a long time that we are <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> close ‚Äì for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-614">So when people ask me, I say (to tell them something), ‚ÄúWe shall see.‚Äù It's certainly not that I don't know; I know perfectly well how it will be. But <em>(laughing)</em> I don't know when! That, I don't know. Even at this point, I don't know when.</p>

I hardly dare say it, but one example is having a regular schedule ‚Äì always making ablutions at the same hour, always doing japa in the same manner and so on.

A second-to-second discrimination. I know where things are coming from, why they come, their effect, where they're going to lead me, and so on. It's growing more and more frequent, constant, automatic ‚Äì like a state of being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-695"><em>(Mother listens to Satprem read the July 11, 1956 Talk on the vital world. She refuses to have it published in the ‚ÄúBulletin‚Äù .)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-696">To begin with, I said that the vital is peopled by small entities, small formations, the remnants of human beings who have died. But there is a whole vital world which has nothing to do with that one, a world peopled by beings of the vital proper, beings of great power and even great beauty. Most people who dabble in occultism without having a deep enough spiritual life are immediately deluded by them ‚Äì some even take them as the supreme God and worship them. That's generally how religions are created. They are a great success. They are the supreme God of many a religion ‚Äì they are beings of the vital world, and can assume an appearance of overwhelming beauty. They are the biggest impostors in the world, and dangerous at that; it takes the spiritual instinct, the instinct of true spiritual purity, not to be deceived by them.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 117</p>
<p class="PE"> Many religions and sects are founded on revelations and miracles, and every bit of it comes from vital beings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-697">It's one of the greatest problems in human life; I don't mean spiritual life, but the life of people who deal with the beyond.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-698">There are skies (not heavens) in the vital world that are truly paradises. Naturally the real divine element is lacking, but only spiritual purity and the true spiritual sense can show you the difference. All who remain within the vital or mental worlds are completely deluded. They see marvelous things, miracles in profusion (that's where you find the most miracles!).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-699">By neglecting to explain this aspect <span class="note_0">[in this Talk]</span>, I passed over a large part of the topic in silence. I usually don't speak of those things, or else mention them only in passing ‚Äì it terrifies people and they immediately start wondering, ‚ÄúOh, is it really a god? Is it this... is it that? Could it be a devil in disguise?‚Äù They panic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-700">Only it's perfectly true that to deal with those realms one must either be fully protected by a guru, a real guru, a man with knowledge, or else have purity (not saintliness), an unmixed vital and mental purity. Very, very often, <em>bhaktas</em> <span class="note_0">[devotees]</span> of Sri Aurobindo or me ‚Äì when they are sincere, truly sincere, that is, people of great spiritual purity ‚Äì have dozens of beings appear to them, saying, ‚ÄúI am Sri Aurobindo.‚Äù It happens all the time, with all the right external appearances ‚Äì it's very easy for such beings to put on a disguise. It takes the inner psychic purity not to be deceived ‚Äì you invariably <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FEEL</span> something that makes it impossible for you to be duped. But otherwise, many, many people are taken in.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-701">I don't like to talk about this because people here have no discrimination; they would be left with nothing but fear and would no longer believe in anything, forever asking me, ‚ÄúOh, isn't this a trick?‚Äù... Which paralyzes everything. That's why I didn't speak about that in this Talk.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-702"><em>You do say a couple of words about it.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-703">It should at least be mentioned that some beings in the vital world can take on completely deceptive appearances at will ‚Äì all the most dazzling lights are found in the vital, but with a particular quality. So those who have truly approached <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> Light can't be deceived. Because... it's indefinable, something the spiritual sense alone can feel: perfect security, perfect peace, perfect purity (although I hesitate to use the word ‚Äúpurity,‚Äù which has taken on such an idiotic meaning); what I mean is the absence of all admixture.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 118</p>
<p class="PE"> To those with the spiritual sense, the most dazzling vital lights always seem to have something artificial about them ‚Äì they <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FEEL</span> artificial and cold, hard, aggressive, deceptive. But that's the point: you yourself must be beyond all this. Not to be fooled, you mustn't fool yourself!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-704">Actually, that's the main reason I don't like to talk about occultism. It puts people in touch with an extremely dangerous world which can't be safely entered unless one is (I can't even say a saint, because it's not true; some saints enter the vital world and get right into it!)... unless one is transformed, unless one has the true spiritual consciousness. On this condition alone are you perfectly safe. So where are the people with the spiritual consciousness? There are really very few of them, very few. And above all, in those who have this occult curiosity there are also all sorts of vital movements, which make it dangerous for them to enter that world. Unless, of course, they go shielded by the guru's presence; with that, you can go anywhere, it's the same as going there with him. And if you do go with him, all is well; he has the knowledge and he protects you. But going there all on your own is... you need the Divine Protection itself! Or the protection of the guru who represents the Divine. With the guru's protection you are safe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-705"><em>But isn't it possible to have a fruitful collaboration with those beings? Should they be avoided altogether, or what?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-706">Collaboration? Not with them as they are, and not in the world as it is ‚Äì no.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-707">I have told you about my dealings with the Lord of Nations on several occasions ‚Äì it's that kind of thing. It can hardly be called collaboration!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-708">The great ones know (I am not speaking of the multitude of minor beings, but the others; there are millions of emanations ‚Äì emanations by the truckload! ‚Äì but only a few great ones), they know enough to be aware of their own position in the universe and that they will come to an end. They know there is such a thing as the Supreme (although they deny it), and that they are cut off from the Supreme, and that they will come to an end. But they have taken a stand against the Work, the Action, the Progress, and are intent on destroying as much as they can.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-709">Some of them get converted. Their conversion means a great entity joining the divine Work ‚Äì but that seldom happens.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 119</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-710"><em>Yes, but what about the minor gods? You often speak of a ‚Äúlittle Kali‚Äù or a ‚Äúlittle Durga‚Äù; are these beings beneficent?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-711">Ah, they aren't from the vital at all! Not at all! They are manifestations of Overmind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="65" href="#">2</a> beings, projected into the vital world for a specific action. But they aren't vital beings: they have an Origin, they are still linked to a being from another world. Oh, no, not at all!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-712">The same goes for all those beings the Tantrics deal with ‚Äì their origin is not vital, they belong to Nature. They are personified natural forces obedient to the laws of Nature. In other words, they originate from below, not from the vital but the physical world. They are vital forces in the physical, but not of vital origin.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-713">The other day, didn't I tell you the story of those entities working for me?... (It wasn't you? I'd had a vision.) In fact, I very often see entities like Nature spirits when I enter the subtle physical and work there (usually for people here and the Ashram, and for the world at large), I very, very often have them with me, or else I meet them in the course of my work. They are forces, generally feminine in appearance, that do some work and have a great deal of power. They are usually the ones that respond to Tantric invocations (I don't mean the Tantrics who call on Kali or Durga, that's something else altogether, those belong to a totally different world). Most of the time these Nature forces are very willing to help ‚Äì at any rate, they are wonderfully obliging with me! But they are limited beings, with their own ideas and laws, their own volition, and when vexed they can do unpleasant things. Yet they are not hostile beings, nor are they vital beings: they are personified forces of physical Nature, in the subtle physical.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-714">A world of things could be said....</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-715">No, I don't know if it's wise to publish this Talk; if too incomplete, it looks like ignorant chatter. And I have always deliberately refused to say things in full since it's so very disconcerting for people, very disconcerting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-716"><em>But couldn't what you just said be added to the Talk?</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 120</p>
<p class="PE"> I can tell you the result: a lot of people will lose all confidence in what they see. Then it becomes impossible to work with them. I can't even teach them to receive what I tell them in silence any more; they instantly start wondering, ‚ÄúOh, is it Mother or a spirit of falsehood?‚Äù They really have no sense of discrimination, you see, they don't <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span>! So if they have to come every time, wondering ‚ÄúWas it you or was it...?‚Äù And when they're in that state they don't listen properly. There's a whole range of work I can't do any more, because they lack the necessary discrimination. So I normally don't say anything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-717">I really prefer to say nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-718">In fact, practically speaking, that's why these things used to be kept secret: one should get knowledge <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY</span> when it's accompanied by discrimination enabling one to distinguish the origin of what is seen or received. One without the other makes for a dangerous weapon.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-719">Some people have even been driven insane, through their own constant fear ‚Äì out of fear they refused all protection. I tell you, only those with a great devotion and a great love are not deceived ‚Äì a great devotion gives you an immediate sense of things; when your devotion goes like this <em>(shrinking gesture)</em>, you know what it means. But your devotion must be sincere and very strong; it's the only protection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-720">Written things can fall into all sorts of hands and become very dangerous weapons.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-721">No, I prefer not to put these things in the <em>Bulletin; I</em> would rather not speak of occult matters. I understand more and more, now that I am grappling with material difficulties that used to be nonexistent (in the material world, I mean), they didn't exist for me before. The material domain was something happening far below and I didn't bother with it at all. Even when I was practicing occultism in the most material world, I looked on it from above; there was this sort of inner light, this Presence ‚Äì I was born with it, so naturally I had no problems.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-776">All my life I have always, always felt I had something to say, but that there had to be another instrument to say it, to give it a kind of perfection of form I myself was unable to give. Because that's not my job. It's not my job.</p>

Despite her condition, this morning Mother has found the strength to speak. She speaks in English. Her words have been noted down from memory.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-787">Just between eleven and twelve <span class="note_0">[last night]</span> I had an experience by which I discovered that there is a group of people ‚Äì purposely their identity was not revealed to me ‚Äì wanting to create a kind of religion based on the revelation of Sri Aurobindo. But they have taken only the side of power and force, a certain kind of knowledge and all which could be utilized by Asuric forces. There is a big Asuric being that has succeeded in taking the appearance of Sri Aurobindo. It is only an appearance. This appearance of Sri Aurobindo has declared to me that the work I am doing is not his. It has declared that I have been a traitor to him and to his work and has refused to have anything to do with me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-788">There is in that group a man whom I must have seen once or twice, who is not with them in spirit, but only in appearance, but without knowledge. He does not know what kind of being it is. And he always hopes to make him accept me, believing it is truly Sri Aurobindo. I saw this being last night. I won't tell you all the details of the vision. It is not necessary. But I must say that I was fully conscious, aware of everything, knowing that there was an Asuric Force there, but not rejecting it, because of the infinity of Sri Aurobindo. I knew that everything is part of him and I do not want to reject anything. I met this being last night three times, even apologized for sins that I have not committed, and in full love and surrender.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-789">I woke up at twelve, remembering everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-790">Between 12:15 and two I was with the true Sri Aurobindo in the fullest and sweetest relationship ‚Äì there also in perfect consciousness, awareness, calm, and equanimity. At two I woke up</p>

<p class="PE">and noted that just before, Sri Aurobindo himself showed me that still he was not completely master of the physical realm.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-791">I woke up at two and noticed that the heart had been affected by the attack of this group that is wanting to take my life away from this body, because they know that as long as I am in a body upon earth their purpose cannot succeed. Their first attack was many years ago in vision and action. It happened during the night and I spoke of it to no one. I noted the date, and if I can come out of this crisis, I will find it and give it out. They would have liked me dead years ago. It is they who are responsible for these attacks on my life. Until now I am alive because the Lord wants me to be alive, otherwise I would have gone long ago.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-792">I am no more in my body. I have left the Lord to take care of it, if it is to have the Supramental or not. I know, and I have also said, that now is the last fight. If the purpose for which this body is alive is to be fulfilled, that is to say, the first steps towards the Supramental transformation, then it will continue today. It is the Lord's decision. I am not even asking what He has decided. If the body is incapable of bearing the fight, if it has to be dissolved, then humanity will pass through a critical time. What the Asuric Force that has succeeded in taking the appearance of Sri Aurobindo will create is a new religion or thought, perhaps cruel and merciless, in the name of the Supramental Realisation. But everybody must know that it is not true, it is not Sri Aurobindo's teaching, not the truth of his teaching. The truth of Sri Aurobindo is a truth of love and light and mercy. He is good and great and compassionate and divine.... <em>Et c'est Lui qui aura la victoire</em> finale....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="68" href="#">1</a></p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(This is the first conversation with Mother in two months. She is still reclining on her chaise longue. She looks quite pale and fragile, almost translucent. She enlarges upon the experience she had a month earlier, on April 13. The following text was not taped but noted down from memory and then read out to Mother.)</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="PE"> I was at the Origin ‚Äì I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> the Origin. For more than two hours, consciously, here on this bed, I was the Origin. And it was like gusts ‚Äì like great gusts ending in explosions. And each one of these gusts was a span of the universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-836">It was Love in its supreme essence ‚Äì which has nothing to do with what people normally understand by that word.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-837">And each gust of this essence of Love was dividing and spreading out... but they weren't forces, it was far beyond the realm of forces. The universe as we know it no longer existed; it was a sort of bizarre illusion, bearing no relation to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>. There was only the truth of the universe, with those great gusts of color ‚Äì they were colored ‚Äì great gusts colored with something that is the essence of color.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-838">It was stupendous. I lived more than two hours like that, consciously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-839">And then a Voice was explaining everything to me (not exactly a Voice, but something that was Sri Aurobindo's origin, like the most recent gust from the Origin). As the experience unfolded, this Voice explained each gust to me, each span of the universe; and then it explained how it all became like this <em>(Mother makes a gesture of reversal)</em>: the distortion of the universe. And I was wondering how it was possible, with that Consciousness, that supreme Consciousness, to relate to the present, distorted universe. How to make the connection without losing that Consciousness? A relationship between the two seemed impossible. And that's when that sort of Voice reminded me of my promise, that I had promised to do the Work on earth and it would be done. ‚ÄúI promised to do the Work and it will be done.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-840">Then began the process of descent,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="73" href="#">1</a> and the Voice was explaining it to me ‚Äì I lived through it all in detail, and it wasn't pleasant. It took an hour and a half to change from that true Consciousness to the individual consciousness. Because throughout the experience this present individuality no longer existed, this body no longer existed, there were no more limits, I was no longer here ‚Äì what was here was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE PERSON</span>. An hour and a half was needed to return to the body-consciousness (not the physical consciousness but the body-consciousness), to the individual body-consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-841">The first sign of the return to individuality was a prick of pain, a tiny point <em>(Mother holds between her fingers a minuscule point in the space of her being)</em>. Yes, because I have a sore, a sore in a</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="PE"> rather awkward place, and it hurts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="74" href="#">2</a> <em>(Mother laughs)</em>. So I felt the pain: it was the sign of individuality coming back. Other than that, there was nothing any more ‚Äì no body, no individual, no limits. But it's strange, I have made a strange discovery<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="75" href="#">3</a>: I used to think it was the individual <em>(Mother touches her body)</em> who experienced pain and disabilities and all the misfortunes of human life; well, I perceived that what experiences misfortunes is not the individual not my body, but that each misfortune, each pain, each disability has its own individuality as it were, and each one represents a battle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-842">And my body is a world of battles.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-847">That's it exactly. ‚ÄúDescent‚Äù doesn't convey the actual sensation ‚Äì there was no sensation of descent. None. Neither of ascent nor descent. None at all.

There was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY THAT</span>. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT ALONE</span> existed. Nothing else.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(During the night of April 3, Mother had encountered an asuric being who had managed to assume Sri Aurobindo's appearance, as well as a group of people wanting to found a Nietzschean-type religion. Following this encounter, a heart attack had gravely endangered Mother's life. But this was not the first such meeting.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-856">I had said <span class="note_0">[on April 3]</span> I would find the date of my first encounter with that fake Sri Aurobindo. What I found was the date of another experience that followed that encounter by perhaps three or four weeks, so that pins it down <em>(Mother holds up an old desk-calendar page on which she had written.)</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 141</p>
<p class="PE"> ‚ÄúNight of July 24-25, '59: first penetration of the supramental force into the body. Sri Aurobindo alive in a concrete and permanent subtle physical body.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-857">I told you about that experience of meeting Sri Aurobindo (the true Sri Aurobindo) in the subtle physical. This is the exact date ‚Äì early that morning I jotted it down on this paper. And it gives me the approximate date of the other vision: that is, I must have had my first experience with those people somewhere around the end of June or the beginning of July, 1959.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-858">Did I tell you about it?... It was a sort of vision that I took for a beginning of work on the subconscient. I had come to a place where Sri Aurobindo was staying and found him closeted in his room. There was a sort of large hall, an immense hall with rooms opening onto it, and his apartment was off to one side <em>(gesture)</em>. I asked to see him. I was told it wasn't possible and I had to wait. I was astonished. Then certain things happened in the hall concerning A. and M. (rather interesting things, but concerning them personally). And at the same time, I was waiting. When it was all over, I asked once again to go into the room. Then through the doorway I saw... I saw a tall Sri Aurobindo ‚Äì much taller than he actually was ‚Äì strong but rather thin, thin in a way that... not the way he really was ‚Äì it was rather a gauntness, very harsh, very cold; and he was somewhat darker than he used to be. I saw him there, walking up and down; and when he was told I was asking to see him, I saw him in the distance saying, ‚ÄúNo, I don't want to see her. I won't acknowledge her and I don't want anything to do with her ‚Äì she has betrayed me.‚Äù Something like that (I couldn't hear the actual words, but the gestures were plain enough). Well, that was the very first time ‚Äì nothing of the kind had ever occurred before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-859">And I immediately felt that it was the expression of certain people's thoughts. During the war there was a whole clique (I know their names and all the details) who said I had influenced Sri Aurobindo, made him deviate from his nationalist path and turn towards the Allies; they considered me to have ruined his life, his consciousness, his work ‚Äì everything, you understand.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="76" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 142</p>
<p class="PE"> And I was seeing the very <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IMAGE</span> of that in this vision. A person I won't name (but I spoke to him afterwards; he's still here) came out of the room to tell me all this. In my vision I told him two things (it seems very distant now ‚Äì it was back in '59 ‚Äì and I no longer recall if I told him one thing after the other or both together). First of all, I protested against everything that fake Sri Aurobindo was saying about me, and at the same time I was going towards the person coming out of the room (it's someone living here, you know, who is, who was quite close to Sri Aurobindo. Apparently he was under the influence of certain doubting thoughts, certain doubts, that's why he was there). I called him by name and spoke to him in English: ‚ÄúBut surely we have had a true spiritual relationship, a true union!...‚Äù Immediately he melted and said yes, and rushed headlong into my arms. In other words, that was his conversion, and that's why I spoke to him about it afterwards; I didn't tell him about the experience but I spoke of the doubt that was in him. It was truly a beginning of conversion in one part of his being, and for that reason I won't name him. And along with this, in answer to what that fake Sri Aurobindo was saying, I said forcefully (also in English): ‚ÄúThis means the negation of all spiritual experience!‚Äù And immediately the whole scene, the whole construction, everything ‚Äì poof! Vanished, dissolved. The Force swept it all away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-860">Later, when I had that second vision 
<span class="note_0">[April 3, 1962]</span>, I saw that the same being was behind this would-be Sri Aurobindo (and with a whole group organized around him ‚Äì people, ceremonies and so on). So from that I concluded that the thing had been developing. But when I first encountered those people <span class="note_0">[in 1959]</span> it was merely</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 143</p>
<p class="PE"> something in the Subconscient and the effect was only psychological (an hour or two was enough to sort things out and put them in order). It didn't affect my health. But this time....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-861">So it was in '59 that I first saw them, and it must have been the end of June or the beginning of July. This note <span class="note_0">[the desk-calendar page]</span> is what gave me the clue, because I know that the other experience <span class="note_0">[of Sri Aurobindo in the subtle physical]</span> came a few weeks later.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-862"><em>You say there was a whole group organized around that asuric being ‚Äì people, ceremonies....</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-865"><em>But what I would like to ask is whether those people exist in the subtle physical or in our physical world....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-866">No, no ‚Äì my visions are in the subtle physical, but those people exist here on earth, although I don't know who they are.... As I said, I knew only one of them. But it's certain that a physical organization corresponding to these visions does exist. I don't know the details ‚Äì they just haven't been given to me. But it corresponds to a group of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICAL</span> people.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-867"><em>Powerful?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-868">I don't know. I don't know them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-869">There is certainly at least one Tantric among them ‚Äì and a highly skilled Tantric, someone who knows his business. That, yes ‚Äì all the signs are there!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-870">But how powerful are they outwardly?... The people around that fellow <span class="note_0">[the fake Sri Aurobindo]</span>, who leveled all those reproaches at me, used to be in the Ashram ‚Äì they have since left. They were quite real. But the ones in the last group <span class="note_0">[in the most recent vision]</span>, I don't know ‚Äì I don't know them physically, so I can't say.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-873">I didn't receive a promise ‚Äì this Voice made me remember a promise I had made.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-879">And the moment I became aware that it was decreed, I thought, ‚ÄúBut how can <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> be translated into that?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-881">The experiences are going on....</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 145</p>
<p class="PE"> For instance, I am walking a little now, with someone's assistance, to get the body used to it again. And when I started walking, I became aware of a rather peculiar state... I might describe it as: what gives me the illusion of a body <em>(Mother laughs)</em>.... I entrust it to the person I walk with. In other words, it's not my responsibility: the other person has to make sure it doesn't fall, doesn't bump into anything ‚Äì you see what I mean. And the consciousness is a limitless consciousness, like a material equivalent or expression of these gusts ‚Äì it's like waves, but waves with no .... Not separate waves, but a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MOVEMENT</span> of waves; a movement of what might be called material, corporeal waves, as vast as the earth, but not... not round, not flat.... Something giving a great sense of infinity but moving in waves. And this wave movement is the movement of life. And the consciousness (the body-consciousness, I suppose) floats along in this, with a sensation of eternal peace.... But it's not an expanse ‚Äì that's not the word for it. It is a limitless movement, with a very harmonious and very tranquil rhythm, very vast, very calm. And this movement is life itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-882">I walk around the room, and that is what is walking.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-883">And it is very silent ‚Äì there is no thought; there is barely, barely the ability to observe.... And all kinds of movements, an infinity of movements and vibrations of something that could be the essence of thoughts, move there, rhythmically, in a movement of waves without beginning or end, with a condensation like this <em>(gesture from above down)</em>, with a condensation like that <em>(horizontal gesture)</em>, and a movement of expansion <em>(gesture like a pulsating ocean)</em>.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-885">And actually, apart from the fact of suffering (you know, an ache here, an ache there, a pain here, a pain there, giving the sense of bodily individuality), apart from that, that great undulating movement of life is my normal consciousness. Meaning that I... what I call Me <em>(gesture high above)</em>, my consciousness, is completely outside the body. That's what the consciousness of the body is (what I've just been describing), with only points of pain as reminders of what a body usually is: an ache here, an ache there, another ache here.... That's what it's like. And this pain has a</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 146</p>
<p class="PE"> small and extremely limited life; it's not general, it's not a body that suffers: it is suffering that suffers. It's a point, a point of pain ‚Äì a scratch here, a sore there, things like that. That's what is individual and suffers ‚Äì it's not the body that has a sore, you understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-886">It is difficult to express.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-889">Oh yes! The physical consciousness is something very complex; it includes the whole physical, conscious world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-890">My physical consciousness has been universalized for a long, long time, it encompasses all terrestrial movements<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="78" href="#">3</a>; but the body is limited solely to this small concentration of substance <em>(Mother touches her body) ‚Äì</em> that's what I call the body-consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-891">And when I said, ‚ÄúI have left the body,‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="79" href="#">4</a> it certainly didn't mean I have left the physical consciousness ‚Äì my overall contact with the terrestrial world has remained the same. It concerns only the purely bodily aspect, the specific concretization or concentration of substance giving each of us a different body ‚Äì a different <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">APPEARANCE</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-892">And a rather illusory appearance, besides. As soon as you rise to a certain height (I saw it quite clearly during that progressive reconcretization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="80" href="#">5</a>), this appearance quickly loses its reality. Our external appearance is very, very illusory. Our particular form (this one's form, that one's form), the form we see with our physical eyes is very superficial, you know.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-899">Once again, with Mother, we find ourselves deep into modern physics. All theories of physics attempting to describe the structure of our universe and the composition of matter, whether they emanate from ‚Äúofficial‚Äù scientific laboratories or from the work of independent researchers, point to the wavelike or sinusoidal movement as the constituent and dynamic foundation of physical reality. Indeed, whether in electromagnetic or gravitational fields, or in atomic interactions, everything, from the heart of the atom to the farthest reaches of the universe, moves or is propagated as ‚Äúwaves.‚Äù With striking succinctness Mother says, ‚ÄúThe wave movement is the movement of life.‚Äù</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 148</p>
<p class="PE"> ‚Äú...A movement of waves without beginning or end, with a condensation like this <em>(gesture from above down)</em>, with a condensation like that <em>(horizontal gesture)</em> ....‚Äù We cannot fail to be reminded of the electromagnetic field with its two perpendicular components, the electric and magnetic fields, which are propagated along an infinite sinusoidal wave. And then again: ‚ÄúA movement of expansion... a sort of contraction, concentration, and then expansion, diffusion.‚Äù Unmistakably, this is an exact description of the propagation in space of a sinusoidal wave.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-900">Striking though the parallel may be, there is still a fundamental difference between these mathematical concepts and Mother's experience. In the first case, we are dealing with conceptual instruments used by the human mind to better explain and master the world: no one has actually <em>seen</em> electromagnetic waves ‚Äì not to speak of gravitational ones! They are images, convenient ‚Äúmodels,‚Äù invisible and nonexistent in themselves. They exist only through their <em>effects:</em> a beam of sunlight, which is an electromagnetic wave, strikes our retina and enables us to distinguish a flower; by means of gravitational waves, Newton's apple falls from the tree ‚Äì but no one has <em>lived</em> the reality of those waves. The way Mother grasps reality, on the contrary, is first and foremost through lived experience. She is the movement, she is the wave: ‚ÄúI walk around the room, and that is what is walking.‚Äù Here we touch upon a stupendous mystery and a formidable question: How is it possible for a material and cellular body to <em>be</em> the wave that at once constitutes and carries the worlds along in its infinite undulating movement and governs the existence of atoms and galaxies? How is it possible to <em>be</em> an infinite and ubiquitous electromagnetic wave while remaining within the narrow confines of a human body?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-901">In being <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span>, it might be said, Mother thus resolves the famous question of the ‚Äúunified-field theory,‚Äù the theory to which Einstein devoted the last years of his life in vain, that would describe the movements of both planets and atoms in a single mathematical equation. Mother's body-consciousness <em>is one</em> with the movement of the universe, Mother lives the ‚Äúunified-field theory‚Äù in her body. In so doing she opens up to us not merely one more physical theory, but the very path to a new species on earth, a species that will physically and materially live on the scale of the universe. The posthuman species might not simply be one with a few organs more or less, but rather one capable of <em>being</em> at every point in the universe. A sort of material ubiquity. It may not be so much a ‚Äúnew‚Äù as an ubiquitous species, a species that embraces everything, from the blade of grass under our feet to the ‚Äúfar‚Äù galaxies. A multifarious, undulating existence. A resume or epitome of evolution, really, which at the end of its course again becomes each point and each species and each movement of its own evolution.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-76"><sup>1</sup> There was, in fact, a whole group of Ashram people (they might be called the Ashram ‚Äúintelligentsia‚Äù) who, influenced by Subhas Bose, were strongly in favor of the Nazis and the Japanese against the British. (It should be recalled that the British were the invaders of India, and thus many people considered Britain's enemies to be automatically India's friends.) It reached the point where Sri Aurobindo had to intervene forcefully and write: ‚ÄúI affirm again to you most strongly that this is the Mother's war.... The victory of one side (the Allies) would keep the path open for the evolutionary forces: the victory of the other side would drag back humanity, degrade it horribly and might lead even, at the worst, to its eventual failure as a race, as others in the past evolution failed and perished.... The Allies at least have stood for human values, though they may often act against their own best ideals (human beings always do that); Hitler stands for diabolical values or for human values exaggerated in the wrong way until they become diabolical.... That does not make the English or Americans nations of spotless angels nor the Germans a wicked and sinful race, but....‚Äù (July 29, 1942 and Sept. 3, 1943, Cent. Ed., Vol. XXVI.394 ff.)

<p class="PE"><em>The other day you said, ‚ÄúWhat I call Me high above, my consciousness, is completely outside the body.‚Äù And on April 3, you also said something that gave me a kind of jolt: ‚ÄúI am no more in this body.‚Äù Why?... Have you really left this body?</em></p>
<p class="Q">(very long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-902">How can I explain it?..</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-903">I don't know how to explain it....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-904">I could almost tell it as a joke: for years and years I felt my consciousness to be outside my body ‚Äì I always used to say it was there <em>(gesture above the head)</em>, and not in my body. But from the time of that first experience <span class="note_0">[April 3]</span>, when the doctor said the heart had been physically affected and would stop working if I wasn't careful, from that moment on I felt... I felt that my body was outside me! It sounds like a joke, but that's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-905">So to be understood I said, ‚ÄúI am no more in my body.‚Äù But it isn't that. I hadn't been in my body, my consciousness had been outside my body, for quite a long time! But there was a kind of connection, you know, something that made me feel it as ‚Äúmy body.‚Äù (If I spoke carelessly, I could now say ‚Äúwhat used to be my body,‚Äù although I know well enough it's still alive!). Well, from April 3 on, when everyone claimed I was so sick and I was forbidden to get out of bed, I had the impression that what was called my body was now outside me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-906">There was a relation, I kept a link with it, but it took some days to get established (I don't know how many, because for a long time I couldn't keep track of anything). After some days (say ten days, twenty days, I don't know), the will began to function, the body was again under the control of the will. But that didn't happen right away ‚Äì for some days, the will that deals with the body was annulled (I was entirely conscious and alive, but not in my body). The body was merely something moved around by the people looking after me. Not that it was separate, but I couldn't even say, ‚Äúit's a body‚Äù ‚Äì it wasn't anything any more! Something.... Having undergone so much preparation, the universalization of the body-consciousness and all that, the experience didn't even seem</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 150</p>
<p class="PE"> strange to me (in fact, it was certainly the result of all that preparation). The body was... ‚Äúsomething‚Äù like a mass of substance being driven by the will of the three people looking after it. Not that I was unaware of it but.... I wasn't much concerned with it, to tell the truth; but as far as my attention was turned to it, it was a corporeal mass being moved around by a few wills. The supreme Will was in full agreement; the body had been entrusted, in a way (I don't know how to express this)... yes, it was like something entrusted, and I was simply looking on ‚Äì I watched it all for I don't know how many days, with hardly any interest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-907">The one really concrete link was... pain. That's how the contact was kept.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-908"><em>When you said, ‚ÄúI am no more in this body,‚Äù I thought that because of the necessities of the Work some part of you had withdrawn.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-909">Oh, no! Nothing withdrew ‚Äì it had already withdrawn a long time ago. The consciousness wasn't at all centered in the body. When I said ‚ÄúI,‚Äù for instance, it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NEVER</span> occurred to me that ‚ÄúI‚Äù was this <em>(Mother points to her body)</em>. I, the I who spoke, was always a will <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ENTIRELY</span> independent of the body, entirely independent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-910">But there has been a strange phenomenon <span class="note_0">[since April 3]</span>.... Before, I used to say, ‚ÄúI am outside my body.‚Äù It was always ‚ÄúI am outside my body.‚Äù But this time, the body seemed to have been consigned or entrusted ‚Äì more like entrusted....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-911">It has gradually come back, in the sense that actively.... No, I can't even say that ‚Äì it's not true. What has come back is the increasingly precise memory of how I had organized the life of this body, the whole formation I had made, down to the smallest details ‚Äì for the things I was using, how I was making use of them, how I had organized all the objects around the body, all that. What has come back is the memory ‚Äì is it memory? The awareness of all that has returned, as if I were putting the two back into contact. And so, instead of the body being left totally in the hands of those around me, the formation I had made is coming back, with certain changes, certain improvements and simplifications (but mind you, I had neither the intention nor the will to change anything ‚Äì those things are simply coming back into the consciousness like that, with certain changes made). In short, it's a kind of conscious formation recrystallizing around this body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-912">And I have the perception... a sensation, really, the sensation</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 151</p>
<p class="PE"> of... something not at all me, but entrusted to me. More and more now, there is the feeling of something being entrusted to me in the universal organization for a definite purpose. That's really the sensation I have now (the mind is very calm, so it's difficult to express ‚Äì I don't ‚Äúthink‚Äù all these things, they are more like perceptions). And it's not the usual kind of sensation: the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY</span> (I insist on this), the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY</span> sensation that remains in the old way is physical pain. And really, those points of pain... they seem like the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SYMBOLIC POINTS</span> of what remains of the old consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-913">Pain is the one thing I sense the way I used to. Food, for instance, taste, smell, vision, hearing ‚Äì all that's completely changed. They belong to another rhythm. And this condition has come progressively, like a crystallization of something behind the senses that doesn't come from here ‚Äì in taste, smell, vision, hearing, touch.... Except this one point.... Even the sense of touch is different now ‚Äì but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PAIN</span> ....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-914">Pain is the old world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-915">It's quite odd, you know; pain is like the symbolic (and rather too concrete!) sign of life in the Ignorance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-916">And even there I have had an instant (but it was like a flash ‚Äì the flash of a new experience), an instant when pain disappeared into something else. It has happened three or four times. The pain suddenly became... something completely different (not a pleasant sensation, not that at all): another state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-917">If that state remained, I would truly be free of the world as it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-918">Nonetheless, people can still hear me, can't they? And I can still see, but in a peculiar way ‚Äì a very peculiar way. At times I see with greater precision than ever before (generally, as I told you the other day, I seem to see from behind a veil; that's constant). I hear things that way too. Certain sounds.... On one occasion I noticed a sound, a seemingly imperceptible sound, coming from about a hundred yards away, and it seemed to be right here. All this has changed ‚Äì I mean the whole way the organs function. Have the organs themselves changed, or is it their functioning? I don't know. But they all obey another law ‚Äì absolutely.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-919">And I have the definite impression that that so-called illness was the external and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ILLUSORY</span> form of an indispensable process of transformation; without that so-called illness there could be no transformation ‚Äì it is not an illness, I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span> it: when people speak of ‚Äúillness,‚Äù something in me laughs and says, ‚ÄúWhat a bunch of geese!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-920">It is not an illness.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 152</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-921"><em>A disengagement?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-922">Perhaps.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-923">Perhaps.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-924">It was a bit violent! <em>(Mother laughs)</em>... And yet not so violent, because.... There's something I have never told anyone, but when the doctor was called.... I was constantly fainting, you know: I would take a step and ‚Äì plop! So the doctor was called and they began watching over me (everything was supposedly going wrong, all the organs, everything breaking down), and he declared I was sick and wasn't to stir from my bed (for a while I wasn't even supposed to talk!).... Well, at that point, something (not exactly what you would call my consciousness; it was far, far more eternal than my consciousness ‚Äì my consciousness is the consciousness of one form of the Manifestation ‚Äì well, it was far more than that, beyond that)... something said <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">YES</span>. And if ‚ÄúThat‚Äù had not agreed, I could have gone on living almost as usual. ‚ÄúThat‚Äù decreed, ‚ÄúThat‚Äù decided ‚Äì I have never said anything about it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-925">Otherwise, you know, I would not have consented. If ‚ÄúThat‚Äù had not agreed, I would have said to my body, ‚ÄúGo on, keep going, move‚Äù ‚Äì and it would have gone on. It stopped because ‚ÄúThat‚Äù said yes. And then I understood that that whole so-called illness was necessary for the Work. So I let myself go. And then what I told you about happened: this body was consigned to the care of three people, who looked after it marvelously, by the way ‚Äì really, it filled me with constant admiration ‚Äì a selflessness, a care... oh, it was wonderful! I was saying to the Lord the whole time, ‚ÄúTruly, Lord, You have arranged all the material conditions in an absolutely marvelous, incredible way, bringing together whatever is necessary, and placing around me people beyond all praise.‚Äù For at least two weeks they had a hard time of it ‚Äì quite hard. The body was a wreck, you know! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> They had to think of everything, decide everything, take care of everything. And they looked after it very, very well ‚Äì really very well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-926">It's a wonderful story, seen as I see it. And I have observed it very carefully: it isn't an ordinary story seen with an exceptional knowledge, but a true Knowledge and a true Consciousness witnessing an exceptional story. Those three people may not be aware of how utterly exceptional it is, but that's simply because their consciousness is not sufficiently awake. But they too have been, and continue to be, exceptional.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 153</p>
<p class="PE"> The whole story is a fairy tale.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-927">And the only concrete thing left in this world ‚Äì this world of illusion ‚Äì is pain. It seems to me the very essence of Falsehood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-928">But what feels it feels it very concretely!... I clearly see it's false, but that doesn't stop my body from feeling it ‚Äì and there is a reason: it is the battlefield.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-929">I have even been forbidden to utilize my knowledge, power and force to annul the pain in the way I used to (and I used to do it very well). That has been totally forbidden. But I have seen that something else is in sight. Something else is in the making.... It can't be called a miracle because it's not a miracle, but it's something wonderful ‚Äì the unknown.... When will it come? How will it come? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-930">But it's interesting.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-931">Something really radical has happened, in the sense that.... I tried once just to see if I could do it (I had wisely been told not to try) and I didn't succeed: I can't go back to the old way of relating to my body. It's impossible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-932">What is coming back is the way ‚Äúobjects‚Äù ‚Äì the whole mass of material substance making up this body's environment ‚Äì had been organized; that's what is coming back, with some small changes (none of this comes through the head; the head has nothing to do with it). It is a sort of formation reconcretizing itself for life's outer organization.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-933">The old way of relating no longer exists at all.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-934">It can truly be said that for a short while the body went out of my consciousness completely. I didn't leave my body; the body left the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-935">There you have it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-936">I hope you can cope with this ‚Äì it's the first time I have tried to explain it. In fact, it's the first time I am looking at it. And it's interesting. An interesting phenomenon.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-951">I have looked at this very, very often.

After my last experience <span class="note_0">[of April 13]</span> I can no longer think this way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-952">I don't know if I am making myself clear.... I thought for a time, a very long time, that if Science went to its furthest possible limits (if this is conceivable), it would join up with true Knowledge. In the study of the composition of matter, for example ‚Äì by pressing the investigation further and further on ‚Äì a point would be reached where the two would meet. But when I had that experience of passing from the eternal Truth-Consciousness to the consciousness of the individualized world,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="82" href="#">1</a> well... it appeared impossible to me. And if you ask me now, I think that this possibility of Science pushed to its extreme limits joining up with true Knowledge, and this impossibility of any true conscious connection with the material world are both incorrect. There is something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-953">And more and more these days, I find myself facing the whole problem as if I had never seen it before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-954">Both paths may be leading towards a third point, and that third point is what I am at present... not exactly studying; I am rather in quest of it ‚Äì the point where the two paths merge into a third that would be the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span> thing.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 157</p>
<p class="PE"> But in any case, if it could be absolutely total (there's an ‚Äúif‚Äù here), objective, scientific knowledge pushed to its extreme limits would certainly bring you to the threshold. That's what Sri Aurobindo means. But he also says it's fatal, because all those who went in for that knowledge believed in it as an absolute truth, thus closing the door to the other approach. In this respect it is fatal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-955">From my own experience, though, I could say to all those who believe <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EXCLUSIVELY</span> in the spiritual approach, the approach through inner experience, that this ‚Äì at least if it's exclusive ‚Äì is equally fatal. For it reveals to them <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> aspect, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> truth of the Whole ‚Äì but not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> Whole. The other side seems just as indispensable to me, for when I was so utterly in that supreme Realization, this other falsified, outer realization was undeniably just a distortion (and probably accidental) of something <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EQUALLY TRUE</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-956">This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is what we are seeking. And perhaps not merely seeking ‚Äì we may be taking part in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MAKING</span> of it.</p>

We each carry a truth within ourselves, and we must unite with that truth; we must live that truth. And the path we have to follow to realize and unite with this truth is the very path that will lead us as near as we can possibly come to Knowledge. I mean the two are absolutely one: the personal realization and Knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-967">Who knows? Perhaps the very multiplicity of approaches will yield the Secret ‚Äì the Secret that will open the door.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-968">I don't think any single individual on earth (as it is now) no matter how great he may be, no matter how eternal his consciousness and origin, can all by himself change and realize.... Change the world, change the creation as it is, and realize that higher Truth, the Truth that will be a new world ‚Äì a truer, if not absolutely true, world. A certain number of individuals (until now they seem to have come in succession, in time, but they might also come as a collectivity, in space) would seem indispensable for this Truth to be concretized and realized.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-969">On a practical level, I am sure of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-970">In other words, no matter how great he may be, no matter how conscious, how powerful, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> avatar all alone cannot realize the supramental life on earth.

I am convinced of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-971">The individual can give the initial impulse, point out the path, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WALK</span> the path himself (I mean show the path by realizing it)... but he can't bring the work to fulfillment. The fulfillment of the work depends on certain collective laws that are the expression of a particular aspect of the Eternal and Infinite ‚Äì naturally, it's all one and the same Being! There aren't different individuals and personalities, it's all one and the same Being. But the same Being expressing itself in a particular way that for us translates as a group or a collectivity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1001">I don't think all these aphorisms were written for publication ‚Äì I don't believe he was thinking of publishing them. He said certain things that were quite private.</p>

What we need is a ‚Äúcombat magazine,‚Äù a journal that combats all the ordinary ideas; then all these aphorisms (the ones on doctors, for instance) would be like... yes, like commanders in the battle. A journal with the goal of ‚Äúdemolishing the old idols.‚Äù Something along those lines. It would be very interesting to do such a magazine ‚Äì a combat magazine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1007">But it can't be an Ashram organ.... It should look like a literary review (it can't be political ‚Äì you'd be thrown in jail the day after it came out!). It shouldn't be presented as something practical, but merely as literary or philosophical speculation; that wouldn't matter at all, but it would give the journal a certain security which, as a combat magazine, it would need.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1008">It's something that could very well be planned and prepared for '65 or '67. It could probably be done in '67.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1009">It would be very interesting. It's worth looking into.</p>

But Sujata is in a rather special relationship <span class="note_0">[with me]</span> ‚Äì in fact, she does the yoga without doing it; I mean she benefits automatically from the yoga that Sri Aurobindo and I do. And this would risk being damaged.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1023">I don't say for certain; I don't know. But there is a risk. Anyway... as I said, from the external angle, the being would certainly be enriched.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1025">And as for the <em>Agenda</em>, well... it would simply stop, that's all, for the whole time you're away. I might also have nothing to say, I don't know.

For one thing, my nights are totally unconscious ‚Äì the mind turns round and round and I can't sleep. My meditations are always the same.... You know, the feeling of nothing, nothing, nothing.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1044"><em>(After a silence)</em> Among those who have gone beyond the stage of needing successive reincarnations to develop their psychic beings, among those whose souls are conscious, fully developed, there are some who (what shall I say?)... who are chosen or destined to participate in a certain terrestrial action. And in the process of reincarnation, there is always... always some degree of confusion and disarray, you see. I can speak of my own case, if you like; despite every precaution, certain kinds of confusion couldn't be avoided... and of course this complicated the work. It was the same for Sri Aurobindo. And all this confusion sometimes greatly disrupts the work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1045">But there are a certain number of beings ‚Äì not many ‚Äì who have come back on earth <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONLY</span> to take part in a particular work, in a particular way. And outer things, personal and individual things, are virtually sacrificed to that. Certain faculties, for instance, whose source is the higher entity, faculties that in an ordinary life would result in a measure of power or fame or success or realization, are placed under conditions where their outer effect is subordinated to the needs of a particular work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1046">Let me put it to you more clearly: your physical body, for example, should have been either stronger or more supple or endowed with certain very strong vital compensations, so that you wouldn't suffer from your working conditions.... Of course, for someone following a yogic ascent, whose soul is in the process of formation, the external conditions of life are normally what is best for inner development, whatever that may be ‚Äì even if, on the surface, those conditions aren't good. So the only advice you can give such a person is, ‚ÄúWell, either renounce the spiritual life or else put</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 166</p>
<p class="PE"> up with it.‚Äù But that's not your case. There is a Mission, a work, and a kind of gap between a certain physical formation and that Mission. So if you ask me plainly what I see, I can tell you plainly, instead of saying as I would to certain sadhaks or anyone sincerely wanting to do yoga, ‚ÄúTake it or leave it; you must learn to transform yourself inwardly to the point where you can master the body and its needs.‚Äù I can't tell you that, because that's not how it is for you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1047">I mean it may be ‚Äì it may be ‚Äì that even an inner transformation (a complete conversion of the vital being, for instance) wouldn't necessarily bring an improvement in your health. It is here where.... It's not something I see imperatively. And to go back to ordinary life would be the end of everything ‚Äì of your physical life and your inner life too.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1048"><em>I have absolutely no desire to do that!</em></p>

When I came here the first time it was fine, I was very happy, everything was beautiful, everything was perfect, but... oh, to go to the Himalayas for a while! (I have always loved mountains.) I was living over there in the Dupleix house, and I used to meditate while walking back and forth. There was a small courtyard with a dividing wall, and shards of glass were stuck on top of the wall to keep out thieves. And I was meditating ‚Äì meditating on the spiritual life ‚Äì when suddenly something caught my eye: a ray of sunlight on a sharp piece of blue glass on top of the wall. And positively, spontaneously, without thinking or reflecting or anything... I saw the summits of the Himalayas: I was on the summits of the Himalayas.</p>

And at that time too the body was feeling closed in, a little weary and confined. I used to give meditations to about twenty people on the veranda (afterwards I would always tell Sri Aurobindo what had gone on). And one day, as I am walking across the veranda to give the meditation, I turn my eye and... I see the sea. And suddenly it was all oceanic immensity ‚Äì and with a sense of free sailing, from one place to</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 174</p>
<p class="PE"> another.... The sea breeze, the taste of the sea, and the sense of immensity, vastness, freedom... something limitless. It lasted a quarter of an hour, twenty minutes. My body came out of it refreshed, as if I had gone for a long sail.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1131">I want to emphasize that the effect is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICAL</span>: the experience is concrete and has a physical effect. That's what I would like to give you.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1154">There's a strange thing that happens to me all the time, at least fifty times a day (and it's particularly clear at night). In its most external form it's like moving from one room to another, or from one house to another, and you go through the door or the wall almost without noticing it, automatically.... Being in one room is reflected outwardly by quite a comfortable condition, a state where there's no pain at all, no pain anywhere, and a great peace ‚Äì a joyous peace, a state of perfect calm... an ideal condition, at any rate, which sometimes lasts a long, long time. It's mainly at night, actually; during the day people interrupt me with all sorts of things, but for a certain number of hours at night this state is practically constant. And then suddenly, with no perceptible or apparent reason (I haven't yet discovered the why or the wherefore of it), you seem to... <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FALL</span> into the other room, or into the other house, as though you had made a false step ‚Äì and then you have a pain here, an ache there, you're uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1155">Obviously it's the continuation of the same experience I told you about,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="87" href="#">1</a> but now it has come to this. I mean the two states are now distinct ‚Äì noticeably distinct; but so far I haven't found either the why or the wherefore....

<p class="p-num">Page 177</p>
<p class="PE"> a piece of cloth; you know, you iron it out again and again, and the wrinkle comes back. That's more the feeling it gives me ‚Äì not at all a conscious habit, just an old rut. But might something from outside also be provoking it...?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1156">And the dreams it gives me! Oh, there's a whole series of them, with particular styles and categories.... You start down a flight of stairs ‚Äì no more stairs; you want to take a certain road ‚Äì the road closes; you want to catch someone ‚Äì you can't. All kinds of things. And although these dreams (I have a whole collection of them, in fact) recur with certain minor outward differences, they are all of the same type. It's a well-known type which I now classify as <em>self-imposed troubles</em>. When I get out of it and look, I see very clearly that it's only this nasty habit we have of fretting over nothing! <em>(Laughingly)</em> Oh, whatever we want to do, immediately there's a complication, a difficulty....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1157">Yes, these dreams arise from the subconscient; they are primarily subconscious habits.... But the pain, the thorns in the garment ‚Äì it's so clear! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> And no way to get comfortable!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1158">In the past, a dream like that would nag me for hours, I would worry, wondering what calamities were going to befall me (this was long, long ago ‚Äì ages ago). But that was idiotic, as I later understood; it's a certain something in the subconscient, a symbolic form of... well, of certain bad psychological habits we have, that's all. And I used to torment myself:‚Äù How can I get rid of this? ‚Äú(We're all loaded with a multitude of such weaknesses built into the body.) And then through experience I understood ‚Äì I saw it was merely certain bad habits.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1159">The only thing to do is not torment yourself and to say to the Lord (in all sincerity, of course),‚Äù It's up to You. Rid me of this. ‚ÄúAnd it is very effective. Very effective. At times I have had old things like that dissolved in a flash; certain inveterate little habits ‚Äì so stupid, but so ingrained you can't get rid of them. Then, while doing japa or walking or meditating or whatever, suddenly the flame flares up and... (you have really had enough of it; it disgusts you, you want it to change, you really want the change) and you say to the Lord,‚Äù I can't do it on my own. ‚Äú(You very sincerely know you can't do it; you have tried and tried and tried and have achieved exactly nothing ‚Äì you can't do it.)‚Äù Well then, I offer it to You ‚Äì You do it. ‚ÄúJust like that. And all at once you see the thing fading away. It is simply wonderful. You know how Sri Aurobindo used to take away someone's pain? It's exactly the same. Certain habits bound up with the body's formation.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 178</p>
<p class="PE"> One day I will certainly use the same method on those‚Äù room changes, ‚Äúbut for that it will have to become very clear and distinct, well defined in the consciousness. Because that change of room (intellectually you would call it a‚Äù change of consciousness, ‚Äúbut that means nothing at all; we're dealing here with something very, very material)... I have sometimes gone through it without experiencing <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ANY CHANGE OF EFFECT</span>, which probably means I was centered not in the material consciousness but in a higher consciousness dwelling and looking on from <em>elsewhere</em> ‚Äì a witness consciousness ‚Äì and I was in a state where everything flows... flows like a river of tranquil peace.... Truly, it's marvelous ‚Äì all creation, all life, all movements, all things, and everything like a single mass, with the body in the midst of it all, blending homogeneously with the whole... and it all flows on like a river of peace, peaceful and smiling, on to infinity.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1192">The body has been cradled by three Words....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1193">Words that repeat themselves automatically, with no effort of will (but the body itself is quite aware that although these three particular Words happen to have been given to it, it might also have been something else ‚Äì it was originally the choice of a higher Intelligence). This has become an automatic accompaniment. It is not so much the words in themselves as what they will represent and bring with them in their vibration.... I mean it would be quite inaccurate to say,‚Äù Only these Words are helpful, ‚Äúno, not that. But they provide an accompaniment, an accompaniment of subtle, physical vibrations, which has built up a certain state or experience, a sort of association between the presence of those words and this movement of eternal Life, that undulating vibration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1194">Obviously, another center of consciousness, another (how shall I put it?)... another concretization, another amalgam, might ‚Äì would of course ‚Äì have another vibration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1195">In ordinary language, the vibration of the mantra is what helps the body to enter a certain state ‚Äì but it is not particularly <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span> mantra: it is the particular relationship established between a mantra (it has to be a true one, a mantra endowed with power) and the body. It surges up spontaneously: as soon as the body starts walking, it walks to the rhythm of those Words. And the rhythm of the Words quite naturally brings about a certain vibration, which in turn brings about the state.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1196">But to say it's these particular Words exclusively would be ridiculous. What counts is the sincerity of the aspiration, the exactness of the expression and the power; that is, the power that comes from the mantra being accepted. This is something very interesting: the mantra has been <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ACCEPTED</span> by the supreme Power as</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 183</p>
<p class="PE"> an effective tool, and so it automatically contains a certain force and power.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="91" href="#">5</a> But it is a purely personal phenomenon (the expression is the same, but the vibrations are personal). A mantra leading one person straight to divine realization will leave another person cold and flat.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1197">What is your experience when you say your mantra? You once told me you felt good saying it....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1198"><em>I generally find it restful.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1199">Yes, that's it; that's very good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1200"><em>But I don't know what it represents.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1201">It represents what you put into it ‚Äì your aspiration, mon petit. No, to me it can represent only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> thing.... I call it‚Äù the Supreme, ‚Äúbecause you have to call it something, but that Something is the farthest limit of our aspiration, our aspiration in every sense, in all directions, on all occasions. Something that is the supreme summit of our aspiration, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WHATEVER</span> that aspiration may be, in whatever direction, in whatever realm ‚Äì beyond, really beyond, Something beyond any form of activity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1202">For me, the most concrete approach to this is through the vibration of pure Love; not love for something, a love you give or receive, but Love in itself: Love. It is something self-existent. And it is certainly the most concrete approach for me. (But it isn't exclusive ‚Äì it contains everything else within itself; it doesn't exclude all the other approaches, all the other contacts.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1203">You see, throughout my childhood and youth and the whole beginning of my yoga, there was a sort of refusal in my being to use the word‚Äù God, ‚Äúbecause of all the falsehood behind that word (Sri Aurobindo rid me of that; in the same way he got rid of all limitations, he rid me of that one too). But it's not a word that comes to me spontaneously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1204">But Love.... At the moment of contact, when it goes like this <em>(gesture)</em> ‚Äì at that moment something surges up....</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 184</p>
<p class="PE"> But the words don't matter, they're unimportant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1205">And yet I have noticed that to associate a certain state and a certain aspiration with a certain sound helps the body. No one told me the mantra; I had begun doing japa before we met X (it had come to me when I was trying to find a means of getting the body to take part in the experience ‚Äì the body itself, you know: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THIS</span>). And this help was certainly given to me, because the method imposed itself very, very imperiously ‚Äì when I heard certain Words it was like an electric shock. And then, disregarding all Sanskrit rules, I made myself a sentence; it isn't really a Sanskrit sentence, or any kind of sentence at all ‚Äì a phrase made up of three Words. And these three Words are full of meaning for me. (I wouldn't mention it to a Sanskritist!) They have a full, living meaning. And they have been repeated literally millions and millions of times, I am not exaggerating ‚Äì they surge up from the body spontaneously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1206">It was the first sound that came from the body when I had that last experience <span class="note_0">[April 13]</span>. Along with the first pain, came that first sound ‚Äì so it must be quite well rooted.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="92" href="#">6</a> And it brings in exactly that vibration of eternal Life: the first thing I felt, all of a sudden, was a kind of strong calm, confident and smiling.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1207">Oh, I am sure it is very good, very helpful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1208">Voil√†, mon petit. Nowadays I have nothing to say ‚Äì I chatter away quite uselessly. But... I like to see you. And I think it's worthwhile.</p>

<p class="PE"> <em>(Mother refers to the previous conversation, in which she was looking for the reasons behind the passage from one room to another, from the room of pain to the true room: ‚ÄúI can't catch hold of what makes it happen. What's happening? What's going on?!‚Äù)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1211">I had an experience yesterday afternoon that might put us on the track.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1212">It was a very interesting experience ‚Äì especially interesting for some people because I became aware of certain reincarnations. I was in a state that might be called a ‚Äústate of knowledge,‚Äù where I knew things with certainty, without any doubt.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1213">But what's striking ‚Äì it's connected to what I was telling you the other day ‚Äì is that I was going to see some people who were on the other side of a river. Ordinarily the river water wasn't clean and you needed a boat or something to cross; but yesterday I was in a special state ‚Äì I just sat down on the water and said, ‚ÄúI am going there.‚Äù And then, quite naturally, a current of pure, crystal clear water simply took me where I wanted to go. It was a very pleasant sensation ‚Äì I was sitting on the water, all smiles, and... prrt! I was taken to the other side. ‚ÄúOh, very good!‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúWill it continue?...‚Äù And so once again I said, ‚ÄúI am going there‚Äù (that is, back to this side) and... prrt! Back I came.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1214">Then someone came.... There are symbolic people in these ‚Äúdreams‚Äù; they seem to be made up of various parts of the beings of those around me, people who have a particular relationship with me and bring a particular help to the Work. They are symbolic characters and always the same: one of them is tall and thin, some are small, there are young ones, old ones.... I can't say it's this person or that person, but rather that something <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> this or that person is represented in these characters. And one of them is like a ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù ‚Äì he helps out in certain circumstances; if there's a boat, for instance, the big brother steers it. So he came up to me and said, ‚ÄúYes, I know the method,‚Äù and began to try. ‚ÄúStop, for heaven's sake!‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou'll spoil everything; to make it work I have to say: I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WANT TO GO THERE</span>.‚Äù When he began trying to bring me across with his own methods, the water grew muddy again and I started to sink! ‚ÄúNo no no!‚Äù I protested. ‚ÄúDon't do that, that's not</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 188</p>
<p class="PE"> it at all! <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> has to...‚Äù (although I wasn't formulating it to myself, what I meant was the sense of a certain higher Will) ‚Äú<span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> has to say: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">I WANT TO GO THERE</span>; then it works.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1215">After that, the experience changed, other things happened. But what I have just related is certainly part and parcel of that experience the other day <span class="note_0">[the two rooms, one inside the other]</span>, because the two were coexistent.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="93" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1216">And the water was so real! The experience was so real that I could feel the coolness of the water; I had the pleasant sensation of sitting on something very soft and cool and swift, carrying me along.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1217">It must be part of the same series of experiences.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1218">And I know I was in a state of knowledge, because I suddenly knew who certain people here ‚Äì people I have known for a very, very long time ‚Äì were the reincarnations of (I had never tried to find that out, it just came). I was almost calling them by their former names.... Yes, a special state, a state of knowledge ‚Äì but not spiritual knowledge: a knowledge related to the material world. In such visions, water always represents the vital. When everything is harmonious with the water, it means the vital is harmonious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1219">It was delightful (it happened around 1:30 in the afternoon): sitting on the water the way you would sit on a chair! And the water was so clear, crystal clear, transparent, rippled with tiny waves; the depths were dark blue, but the surface was perfectly clear, transparent, almost colorless. Then when the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù came, boasting that he knew how to do it too, and would take me across, the water began to get muddy, as river water always is ‚Äì a dirty grayish yellow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1220">It must be the continuation of that experience the other day. I was beginning to find the key.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1221"><em>What does this ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù represent?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1222">Material knowledge, I think ‚Äì I mean the higher use of the physical mind, which keeps you from entering the true room.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="94" href="#">2</a> Because I simply kept repeating, ‚ÄúI have to say: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">I WANT TO GO</span></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1225">Immediately, as soon as I am in that state, there's an instantaneous will to spread it around as much as possible, so that all who are close to me in some way, materially or spiritually, may benefit from it.

It wouldn't be kind to name them, because... really, you would never expect them to have such experiences! And it certainly comes from that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1229">Yes, it has effects ‚Äì far and near. The people nearest to me don't seem to be the most receptive; but with them the action is much more complex and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SOLID</span> ‚Äì I mean instead of a sudden experience that's almost, as I said, out of proportion to their normal condition, something is being progressively <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BUILT</span>....

<p class="p-num">Page 190</p>
<p class="PE"> in the midst of constructions, immense constructions in the making. It was like that last night; I had to flounder about in something like cement, a kind of batter. And then I meet all sorts of people who are also more or less symbolic, but who sometimes have the features of a specific person. It's a whole <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WORLD</span> of circumstances, symbolic down to the most minute details. I remember everything, but I would have to describe a whole world... and an apparently uninteresting world, at that (outwardly uninteresting, I mean); but it gives me the key, from every point of view, to the present state of things, to the world now in the making.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1230">Last night I spent almost all my time in such a building. And all the people who help the work were symbolized there ‚Äì but it's always a material help, either work or money or.... I remember being particularly struck by one character last night. (Again, there were a lot of aggravations, but someone or something was always on the scene when I arrived and it all sorted itself out ‚Äì it was the exact opposite of the dreams I was talking about the other day: all the difficulties sorted themselves out when I arrived.) Then I came to a rather difficult place to cross (you had to flounder about on slippery scaffoldings) and suddenly, facing me, there was a man (of course, it was probably a symbol rather than a man, but it might really be someone physical). He was one of the workers, a master mason (when I woke up this morning, I thought of the symbolism of Freemasonry and wondered if it might give a clue to the experience). Nearby, people were coming to supervise, observe, direct, people who thought themselves highly superior... but they were never any help in solving practical problems! They were creating more problems than they were helping to solve. Anyway, this master mason appeared to be around fifty, with a beautiful face ‚Äì a worker's face, beautiful and concentrated. There was a difficult place to cross, and he had worked the thing out very efficiently, with a lot of care. Then, when it was all done and I was able to go on my way, I felt a great surge of love go out to him, with neither gesture nor word ‚Äì and he received it, he felt and received it. His face lit up and he implored me, with wonderful humility, ‚ÄúNever let me forget this moment, the most beautiful moment of my life.‚Äù (I don't know what language he used because it didn't come to me in words.) It was such an intense experience. His humility, his receptivity, his response were all so beautiful and pure that when I woke up ‚Äì when I came out of the experience, at any rate ‚Äì I was left with a most delightful impression.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1231">What he represents might be partly manifested by somebody</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 191</p>
<p class="PE"> here. A beautiful face... a man around fifty. Or it may be symbolic: such characters are sometimes put together with features from several people, to make it very clear that they represent a state of consciousness and not an individual. It's far more often a state of consciousness than an individual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1232">But this experience left me with a true sense of satisfaction, of fullness: his work had been perfect and his response to the divine Force, to the Grace that came to him, was magnificent.... It may be several people,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="95" href="#">3</a> it may be one particular person ‚Äì I don't know. It happened just last night.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1233">You remember all the difficulties I encountered in those other visions at night. Well, this was very interesting because it was just the opposite: I was in a very complicated place full of obstacles and difficulties, but someone or something was always there when I arrived ‚Äì everything would get sorted out and I would go on my way. It all sorted itself out automatically... the feeling of a power putting everything in order. And I remember when the mason arrived, just as I was facing that rather big obstacle, there was someone on my right (someone very ‚Äúofficial,‚Äù wearing a dark coat) who thought (the contact was through thought rather than words), ‚ÄúOh! She's always calling on the workers for help instead of....‚Äù And I answered, ‚ÄúThe workers are more efficient and their goodwill...‚Äù (all that business of ‚Äúcaste,‚Äù you know, or of ‚Äúsociety‚Äù or ‚Äúsocial position‚Äù). ‚ÄúThe workers have simple hearts,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúthey are efficient in their work and have more goodwill than the people who think they're so smart!‚Äù It was funny. So this made two interesting experiences yesterday, one after the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1234">The afternoon experience was very intriguing; I was busy working (organizing things for one of the departments, I no longer remember which) and then I said to the person I was with, ‚ÄúNow I am going to my cousins' place!...‚Äù When I was very young I had a cousin, the eldest son of one of my father's brothers (he had a large family, such as you seldom see in France). This cousin became some kind of engineer ‚Äì a civil engineer, maybe, or a mechanical engineer (he was an outstanding chemist). Anyway, this boy was very attracted to me. He went off to the war as an officer and caught some disease (I forget what) and died around 1915, at the time I returned to France. Well, in my experience yesterday afternoon, a certain family living <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HERE</span> gave me exactly the same sensation I had had towards those people when I was</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 192</p>
<p class="PE"> young. And especially for this cousin (for the rest of the family it was more vague, like a <em>background</em> to the experience). ‚ÄúI am going to their place,‚Äù I said. They have a lovely estate here, just as they had a lovely estate in France before (they had Madame de Sevigne's chateau at Sucy, near Paris ‚Äì a beautiful property). And it was all so concrete! It wasn't coming through the head; it wasn't a thought but a sensation. ‚ÄúI have to go see him now,‚Äù I said. And even as I was having my vision I was telling myself, ‚ÄúYou must be going crazy! Can they really be here in Pondicherry?‚Äù This uncle with whom I had only rather distant relations and this cousin I never saw much of, but whom I knew to be very nice and very loyal ‚Äì ‚ÄúAre they really here?!‚Äù The sensation was most strange (the head wasn't functioning at all; it was a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SENSATION</span>). So off I went to see this ‚Äúcousin,‚Äù and it was on the way to see him that I had the experience of crossing the river. And on the way back, after the discussion with the ‚Äúspiritual brother‚Äù (whom I really told off: ‚ÄúGet out of here! I don't need you!‚Äù), after that, when I found myself back on the bank, I started collecting my consciousness again, telling myself, ‚ÄúLook here now! Let's try to see clearly.‚Äù And then I realized that the cousin who died prematurely during the war had reincarnated in someone here. ‚ÄúHow strange,‚Äù I thought.... And the dates coincided.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1235">But that is a singular state: there is no mental intervention at all; you live things <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">POSITIVELY</span>, just as you experience them physically, in the same way that this <em>(Mother knocks on the table next to her)</em> is physically a table. It's that kind of perception ‚Äì something positive. I positively said, ‚ÄúI am going to my cousins' place,‚Äù and the relationship had an absolutely positive vibration ‚Äì it wasn't at all something thought or even ‚Äúremembered‚Äù: there's no ‚Äúremembering‚Äù anything, it's simply there, alive. A strange state. I have had it on several occasions, and when I have it I am aware that this must be the state people who know what is happening and make predictions are in ‚Äì in this state there is no possibility of doubt. No thoughts intervene ‚Äì none at all, not one. Absolutely nothing intellectual: simply certain vital-physical vibrations, and then you know. And you don't even wonder how you know; it's not that kind of thing ‚Äì it's self-evident. And since I was in that state when I saw the reincarnation of the cousin, I am perfectly sure of what I saw. And god knows <em>(Mother laughs)</em>, when I came out of it and began to look at it all with my usual consciousness, I said to myself, ‚ÄúMy word! I would never have thought of such a thing!‚Äù It was millions of miles from any</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 193</p>
<p class="PE"> thought of mine. Besides, I never used to think of that cousin; he was a fine boy but I never paid much attention to him, he had no place in my active consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1236">It's fun.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1237">Well, mon petit. If you could have nights like that ‚Äì it's so much fun!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1238"><em>There must be a gap somewhere.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1239">There is ‚Äì I know there is. There's simply a void between two parts of your consciousness, and when your consciousness passes through, it loses touch with everything on the other side.... It's as though you had fallen into a hole, and then, ooh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1240">It takes a very long time to build, but there must be a way to make a bridge ‚Äì that's what I am hunting for now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1241"><em>But isn't there a practical method?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1242">A practical method... yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1243">First of all, materially speaking, when you wake up you must <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALWAYS KEEP STILL</span>. You have to teach your body.... You know, you mustn't even <em>(Mother turns her head)</em> move your head. Keep completely still. And stay like that, suspended between sleep and waking, with a very <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRANQUIL</span> will to remember.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1244">You may succeed immediately, but it may also take time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1245">But from the purely material standpoint, it's elementary: if you so much as turn your head on awaking, everything fades away. You have to stay absolutely still, in a sort of peaceful concentration. And then you wait.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1246">If you sometimes remember a word or a gesture, a color or an image, hang on to it and don't move.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1247">Some people succeed right away; for others it takes longer. But it always succeeds in the end. You just have to build a bridge, that's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1248">And then, don't be in a hurry to get up, above all don't say, ‚ÄúOh, I'll be late....‚Äù Just stay there, as if you had all eternity before you.</p>

<p class="PE"> Did you see anything last night? Feel anything?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1249"><em>??</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1250">I am asking because last night I tried... it was around four in the morning and I was concentrating on trying to build that bridge <span class="note_0">[between your waking consciousness and the other consciousness]</span>. You didn't feel anything?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1251"><em>It's very vague.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1252">It's another way of remembering, that's why.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1253">It must give a sort of woolly effect to someone not used to it.... You know, when you want to draw your consciousness within ‚Äì what people call ‚Äúconcentrating‚Äù ‚Äì for meditation, for instance, or japa, well, to the sharp-edged surface consciousness the movement of interiorization is like entering something... not exactly ‚Äúsmoky,‚Äù because it isn't dark, but woolly: the feeling of something with no angles, no precise demarcations. Don't you have that impression when you concentrate?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1254"><em>I don't see anything when I concentrate.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1255">Not see: feel.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1256">All this belongs to another kind of sense. Not a physical sense, but a sort of sensation. It's all sensation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1257">For example, just now I was sitting and waiting for you. When I have nothing to do I can't stay one second without immediately turning within ‚Äì instead of the consciousness being turned outside, it's turned within ‚Äì and well, I noticed that the body, which was sitting and waiting, had the feeling of going into something woolly, rounded, <em>soft</em>. And in both cases I was motionless. I was simply sitting here waiting. It's like going from something crisp, clear, precise (forget about thought or vision: this is pure sensation), from something crisp, precise, defined, into something soft, mellow... like a light white smoke ‚Äì not milky white, but soft, transparent and oh, such peace.... As if nothing in the world could resist that peace.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 195</p>
<p class="PE"> It happened in a split second: I was sitting, waiting for you, thinking you were about to come; but the door wasn't opening, so automatically the body went like this <em>(inward-turning gesture)</em>. And since it happened so suddenly, I noticed the difference in the way the body felt.... What it normally feels is a formidable will ‚Äì very tranquil, very peaceful, free of tension or agitation, yet so direct and clear, concentrated (not concentrated: coagulated) that it is almost hard. And that's what controls the body, that's what the body obeys. And when that's not there, it's the other state: smooth, mellow, <em>soft</em>, woolly... and what peace! As if nothing in the world could disturb it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1258">It took maybe a second or a fraction of a second ‚Äì that's why I was able to observe both states.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1259">And as far as I remember (because I never remember fully), this sort of ‚Äúhaziness,‚Äù as it were, was my constant state at the start of that so-called illness; everything was that way ‚Äì people, things, life, the universe. That's how it was, with only that special Vibration, so soft, so enveloping. And it has stayed, it is still here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1260">It doesn't take me any time, the time factor doesn't enter into it at all ‚Äì it's a sort of inner resolution: this way or that way <em>(Mother turns the palms of her hands in and out)</em>. People say, ‚ÄúOh, you've been waiting!‚Äù No, I never wait; it's either action or a sort of blissful peace <em>(same in and out gesture)</em>. And I am talking about the body, not the spirit ‚Äì the spirit is elsewhere. Elsewhere. The <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BODY</span> feels like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1261">And what nights I have!... Nights like the one I told you about the other day, with visions and actions; and then I have nights.... All night last night, I didn't lose consciousness, I don't feel I slept for a minute; and it was like being in a sort of temporal Infinity <em>(both hands open above the head)</em>. From time to time, I look at the clock (all at once I feel something pulling me and I look at the clock): two or two and a half hours have passed ‚Äì like a second. Did I sleep, you ask? Did the consciousness fall asleep? No, not for a second. But the sense of time completely disappears into... into an inner immobility. But an immobility in motion!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1262">If it keeps on like this, they will put me in a padded cell!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1263">Strange....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1264">I had decided to tell you nothing because I really have nothing to say ‚Äì it's something that's going to need some time to become clear. But then this happened just now as I was waiting for you. So I looked, something above looked at what was happening in the body, as though asking it, ‚ÄúLet's see, how does this feel to you?‚Äù And I have told you how it feels.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 196</p>
<p class="Q"> (silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1265">I am translating ‚ÄúThe Yoga of Self-Perfection‚Äù: what the body must be and must become to serve as an instrument. It's touching....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1266">But one thing has happened practically without my noticing it. In the past, before that experience <span class="note_0">[April 13]</span>, the body used to feel the struggle against the forces of wear and tear (different organs wearing out, losing their endurance, their power of reaction, and certain movements, for instance, becoming less easy to make). That's what the body felt, although the body-consciousness never sensed any aging, never, none ‚Äì that simply didn't exist. But in actual material fact, there was some difficulty.... And now, looking at it in the ordinary way, externally, superficially, you might say there has been a great deterioration; well, the body doesn't feel that way at all! What it feels is that a particular movement, effort, gesture or action belongs to the world ‚Äì this world of ignorance ‚Äì and isn't being performed in the true way: it's not the true movement, done in the true way. And its sensation or perception is that the state I was speaking of, <em>soft</em>, with no angles, has to develop along a certain line and produce effects on the body that will make true action possible, action expressing the true will. With no difference on the surface, perhaps (I don't know about that yet)... but done in another way. And I am not talking about grandiose things, mind you, but of everyday activities: getting up, walking, taking a bath. I no longer have a feeling of incapacity, but a feeling of (what's the word for it?)... an <em>unwillingness</em> ‚Äì a bodily <em>unwillingness</em> ‚Äì to do things in the old way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1267">There is another way to be found.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1268">But not ‚Äúfound‚Äù with the head, it's not like that.... A way that is somewhere <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN THE MAKING</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1269">I am speaking of the smallest things ‚Äì take brushing the teeth; there's a difference between the way I brush my teeth now and the way I used to. (In appearance, I suppose it's the same thing.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1270">And I have difficulty (it's almost an unwillingness too) seeing things the way others see them. It's difficult for me, not spontaneous: it would take an effort I don't care to make.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1271">As for the head, it has learned to keep still.... I walk in the mornings and afternoons, saying the mantra as I did before; but while before I had to drive thoughts away, concentrate and make an effort, now this state comes and takes over everything ‚Äì the head, the body, everything ‚Äì and then I walk in that woolly</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 197</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(In the course of the preceding conversation, Satprem had thought that rather than a subjective change, a change in one's attitude towards things, there should be an objective change, a power capable of changing the very substance of things: their property of hardness, for instance. Here Mother elucidates her previous statement that ‚Äúif matter were changeable, it would have changed long ago,‚Äù a statement that, at first glance, seemed to shatter all hope of transformation.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1318">There is nothing to change! Only the relations between things change....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1319">As an analogy, look at what science has discovered about the so-called composition of matter at the atomic level ‚Äì there's nothing to change. Nothing to change! The constituent element doesn't change, the relations between things are what change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1320">Everything has one and the same constituent element, you see; and everything lies <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> the interrelations.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">1</a> Well, it's exactly the same for the transformation.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 202</p>
<p class="PE"> So you speak of ‚Äúpower,‚Äù but in fact....</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1321">The notion of ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">STILL</span> belongs to the old world and to the three, or at most four, dimensions.... It is one and the same Power that changes the interrelations within one and the same element; to put things simply, the Power that gives the subjective experience <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AND</span> the objective realization is the same; it is only a matter of a greater or lesser totality of experience, as it were. And if the experience were total it would be the experience of the Supreme, and it would be universal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1322">Does what I am saying make any sense?...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1323">It all practically comes down to a capacity to spread the experience, or to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INCLUDE</span> things in the experience (it's the same thing). You really have to forget this business of one person and then another, one thing and then another.... Even if you can't realize it concretely, at least imagine that there is but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> thing, excessively complex, and (depending on the case) one experience taking place in one spot, or spreading out like oil on water, or embracing everything. This is all very approximate, but it's the only way the thing can be understood. And the sole explanation for ‚Äúcontagion‚Äù is in that Oneness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1324">And power is what makes the difference. The greater the power, you might say (these words are all very clumsy), the farther the experience spreads. How great the power is depends on its starting point. If its starting point is the Origin, the power is... let's say universal (we won't consider more than one universe for the moment); it is universal. As this Power manifests from plane to plane, it becomes more concrete and limited; on each plane, the field of action becomes more limited. If your power is vital (or ‚Äúpranic,‚Äù as it's called here in India), the field of action is terrestrial, and sometimes limited to just a few individuals, sometimes it's a power capable of acting on just one small being. But originally it's the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> power, acting on the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> substance... I can't express it, words are impossible; but I sense very clearly what I mean.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1325">I can affirm that this notion of ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù still belongs to the world of illusion. The <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONTENT</span> of the experience is what may be either microscopic or universal, depending on the specific quality of the power being expressed, or its field of action. The limitation of power can be voluntary and deliberate; it can be a willed, and not an imposed limitation, which means that the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 203</p>
<p class="PE"> Will-Force may come from the Origin but deliberately limit itself, limit its field of action. But it is the same power and the same substance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1326">Ultimately there is but one power and one substance. There are varying modalities ‚Äì countless modalities ‚Äì of power and substance, but there is but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> power and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> substance, as there is but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> consciousness and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1327"><em>Yes, but when you say that what changes is only ‚Äúthe relations between things,‚Äù it's still a matter of subjectivity (I use the word for lack of a better one). But when we come down to the brass tacks of transformation ‚Äì physical immortality in the body, for instance ‚Äì doesn't it involve more than a simple inner change of relations? Doesn't <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MATTER</span> itself have to be transformed? So there has to be a power over matter. Not merely a change of relations... no?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1328">No; you can't grasp what I mean by the word ‚Äúrelation‚Äù unless you take it scientifically. Your body, and my body, this table, this carpet, are all made up of atoms; and these atoms are constituted of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> thing. The differences we see ‚Äì different bodies, different forms ‚Äì are due to the movements or the interrelations within this same thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1329"><em>Yes, so then it's the interrelations that have to change.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1330">But this has to be very concretely grasped. Well, I say that the power must change this intra-atomic movement. Then, instead of disintegrating, your bodily substance will obey the movement of Transformation, you follow? But it's all the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SAME</span> thing! What must change are the relations among things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1331">And so it becomes <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EVIDENT</span> that immortality can be achieved! Things get destroyed simply because of their own rigidity ‚Äì and even then, it's only a semblance of destruction; the essential element stays the same, everywhere, in everything, in decay just as much as in life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1332">It is extremely interesting!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1333">Ultimately, it's all the constructing Will. This constructing Will is eternal, immortal and infinite ‚Äì it's obvious ‚Äì so if it is left to this Will, there's no reason why Its creation shouldn't partake of immortality and infinity ‚Äì things don't necessarily have to go through the semblance of disintegration to change form, it's not</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 204</p>
<p class="PE"> indispensable. It has come to be that way for some reason or other (which is probably none of our business), but it's not indispensable, it could be different.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1334">The problem is getting out of it: we see, we touch, and we are enslaved. But if you look up <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THERE</span> <em>(gesture above the head)</em> it all seems quite simple!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1335">And looking up <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THERE</span>, I tell you, I am sure there is no difference between ‚Äúsubjective‚Äù and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù ‚Äì except when you give your individuality and your individual consciousness an independent reality; that is, when you cut everything into little bits with your imagination.... Then, of course....</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-99"><sup>1</sup> In fact, physicists today unanimously admit that the mathematical ‚Äúmodels‚Äù explaining the corpuscular structure of matter have become excessively complex: ‚ÄúThere are too many kinds of quarks [theoretical elementary particles and 'ultimate' constituents of matter] and far too many of their aspects are unobservable.‚Äù There is a call for a simpler working hypothesis, a new idea, simplifying and unifying, that would explain matter without recourse to ‚Äúunobservables.‚Äù<br/><br/>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Unexpectedly, this conversation led into the subject of Satprem's break with X, who had been his guru for the past few years. Here then, briefly, is the story behind the rupture: No sooner had Satprem brought X to the Ashram than a swarm of disciples threw themselves at him. Conspicuous among these were the moneymen, the same wheelerdealers who, eleven years later, after Mother's departure, were to reveal their ambitions in Auroville as well as Pondicherry. Satprem's somewhat straightforward manner soon got in the way of their schemes. He had a deep affection for X and when he repeatedly saw that these people ‚Äì spiritual scoundrels is the only word for them ‚Äì were, in the hope of sowing confusion (for they always prosper best in confusion), bringing false reports to Mother of things X had supposedly said, he tried in all innocence to put X on his guard against the false reports and dishonest people who were wronging him.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1501">What was standing there was a manifestation of one of my states of being, a part of my vital being, or rather one of my innumerable vital beings ‚Äì because I have quite a few! And this one is particularly interested in things on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1502"><em>A projection of yours ‚Äì an emanation?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1503">You know, mon petit, I said one day that in the history of earth, wherever there was a possibility for the Consciousness to manifest, I was there<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="109" href="#">1</a>; this is a fact. It's like the story of <em>Savitri:</em> always there, always there, always there, in this one, that one ‚Äì at certain times there were four emanations simultaneously! At the time of the Italian and French Renaissance. And again at the time of Christ, then too.... Oh, you know, I have remembered so many, many things! It would take volumes to tell it all. And then, more often than not (not always, but more often than not), what took part in this or that life was a particular yogic formation of the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 223</p>
<p class="PE"> vital being ‚Äì in other words something immortal.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="110" href="#">2</a> And when I came this time, as soon as I took up the yoga, they came back again from all sides, they were waiting. Some were simply waiting, others were working (they led their own independent lives) and they all gathered together again. That's how I got those memories. One after the other, those vital beings came ‚Äì a deluge! I had barely enough time to assimilate one, to see, situate and integrate it, and another would come. They are quite independent, of course, they do their own work, but they are very centralized all the same. And there are all kinds ‚Äì all kinds, anything you can imagine! Some of them have even been in men: they are not exclusively feminine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1504">At first, I used to think they were fantasies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1505">Before I met Sri Aurobindo they would come and come and come to me, night after night and sometimes during the day ‚Äì a mass of things! Afterwards I told Sri Aurobindo about it, and he explained to me that it was quite natural. And indeed, it is quite natural: with the present incarnation of the Mahashakti (as he described it in <em>
Savitri</em>), whatever is more or less bound up with Her wants to take part, that's quite natural. And it's particularly true for the vital: there has always been a preoccupation with organizing, centralizing, developing and unifying the vital forces, and controlling them. So there's a considerable number of vital beings, each with its own particular ability, who have played their role in history and now return.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1506">But this one <span class="note_0">[the tall white Being]</span> is not of human origin; it was not formed in a human life: it is a being that had already incarnated, and is one of those who presided over the formation of this present being <span class="note_0">[Mother]</span>. But, as I said, I saw it: it was sexless, neither male nor female, and as intrepid as the vital can be, with a calm but absolute power.... Ah, I found a very good description of it in one of Sri Aurobindo's plays, when he speaks of the goddess Athena (I think it's in <em>Perseus</em>, but I am not sure); she has that kind of... it's an almighty calm, and with such authority! Yes, it's in <em>Perseus ‚Äì</em> when she appears to the Sea-God and forces him to retreat to his own domain. There's a description there that fits this Being quite well.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 224</p>
<p class="PE"> Besides, all the Greek gods are various aspects of a single thing: you see it this way, that way, that way, this way <em>(turning her hand, Mother seems to show several facets of a single prism)</em>.... But it's simply one and the same thing.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="112" href="#">4</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1507">Sri Aurobindo's description fits this Being exactly. And a few days ago, this same Being came, without my calling it or thinking about it or wishing it to come. And it seemed to be saying it was time for it to intervene.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1508">So I let it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1509">During the whole time Sri Aurobindo was here, the four entities he speaks of, the four Aspects of the Mother,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="113" href="#">5</a> were always present. And I was constantly obliged to tell one or the other of them, ‚ÄúNow keep calm, now, now, calm down‚Äù ‚Äì they were always inclined to intervene!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1510">Did I ever tell you? Last time I went down for the pujas (was it last year or the year before? I remember nothing any more, you know: it all gets swept away, brrt!).... Yes, it was the year before last, in '60, after that anniversary.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="114" href="#">6</a> (Durga used to come every year, two or three days before the Durga puja.) I was walking as usual and she came; that was when she made her surrender to the Supreme.... Those divinities don't have the sense of surrender. Divinities such as Durga and the Greek gods (although the Greek gods are a bit dated now; but the gods of India are still very much alive!). Well, they are embodiments ‚Äì what you might almost call localizations ‚Äì of something eternal, but they lack the sense of surrender to the Supreme. And while I was walking, Durga was there ‚Äì really, it was beautiful! Durga, with that awesome power of hers, forever bringing the adverse forces to heel ‚Äì and she surrendered to the Supreme, to the point of no longer even recognizing the adverse forces: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL</span> is the Supreme. It was like a widening of her consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1511">Some interesting things have been happening in that world <span class="note_0">[since the supramental descent]</span>.... How can I explain? Those beings have an independence, an absolute freedom of movement (although at the same time, they are all a single Being), but they had the true sense of perfect Unity only with the supreme Consciousness. And now with this present intervention <span class="note_0">[Mother's]</span>, with this incarnation</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 225</p>
<p class="PE"> and the establishment of the Consciousness here, like this <em>(Mother makes a fist in a gesture of immutable solidity)</em>, in such an absolute way (I mean there are no fluctuations)... <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HERE</span>, on earth, in the terrestrial atmosphere, this incarnation has a radiating action throughout all those worlds, all those universes, all those Entities. And it results in small events,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="115" href="#">7</a> incidents scaled to the size of the earth ‚Äì which in themselves are quite interesting.</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1512">Everything that happened prior to the experience of April 13 has disappeared, as it were, and the usual functioning of the consciousness has been totally annulled; it is trying little by little to create a new mode of operation ‚Äì not merely trying: it is in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PROCESS</span> of doing so on a truer foundation; a truer foundation, or truer relations, or vibrations, or functionings... (I don't know the right word for it: all these things at once). That presence the other day <span class="note_0">[the tall white Being]</span> was nothing essentially new ‚Äì it had already intervened a good many times; and yet it was new, because the whole functioning was new. It's like my experience two nights ago <span class="note_0">[the recharging of batteries]</span>, I had it for months on end; well, it was new because it was based on a new functioning. And each time (is it out of habit, or to make me understand, to make me see the difference?), each time the old functioning starts up, first of all I really feel I am losing the true contact, that the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span> thing is escaping, and then I wonder how anybody can function like that without going insane! That's what strikes me now ‚Äì this feeling of going insane! I mean it grates, it scrapes, it makes no sense ‚Äì <em>it misses the point</em>. It is not the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TRUE</span> thing, it's beside the point. It tries to imitate something inimitable. And so I ask myself, ‚ÄúWhat is this? Am I going crazy? Am I losing my faculties?‚Äù And then I realize it's not that at all! Above there's a state of immutable and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNSHAKABLE</span> concentration, constant and almighty, and with but a drop of That, a spark of That, all problems are solved. Then I see clearly that it's only a demonstration to make me see the <em>inadequacy</em> of the old, habitual functioning ‚Äì to really and truly convince me that it's inadequate. It's rather hard to bear, actually. Last night I had it, I have seen it again in recent days: it lasts a few seconds ‚Äì just enough for a satisfactory lesson! It may also happen to make me understand, but afterwards</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 226</p>
<p class="PE"> I wonder, ‚ÄúWell, if everybody is in this state... they don't know it, but it's just terrible!‚Äù And I realize that the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LEAST</span> thing, the slightest circumstance, is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">COMPLETELY</span> distorted, instantly distorted by the way people... <em>work it out</em>, the way they cause events to develop.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1513">That's an ever-present experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1514">But this is still a period of preparation; the best thing to do now is to look and look and look again, observe and observe and observe again; and to have experiences, lots of experiences, because all that is nothing ‚Äì the thing <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ITSELF</span> must be grasped. We've got to catch the tail of the true functioning, so it can be substituted for the other at will. That's it exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1515">And that requires minute-to-minute observation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1516">Someone reads me a letter, for instance, and I have to answer; and there, superimposed, are both functionings: the ordinary reaction coming from above (nothing from here: it comes from above but it's the ordinary reaction)... and if I follow that and start writing, after a moment comes a kind of sensation that it's inadequate; and then there's the other functioning which is not yet (what's the word? I should be speaking in English!)... <em>handy</em>, not yet at my disposal. I have to keep myself quiet, then it starts operating <span class="note_0">[the new functioning]</span>. But when there's something to be done, the two are superimposed and I have to keep the old one quiet for the other to come. And the other one... ohh, it has some unexpected ways! I answer a letter, for example, or I want to say something to someone: my old way is an expression of what comes from above (it is luminous enough, but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ADAPTED</span>)... but then there's that sensation of inadequacy ‚Äì it won't do. All right. I step back and something else comes; and what comes, I must admit... it's enough to drive people crazy! It's so <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUCH SOMETHING ELSE</span>!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1517">I wrote a letter like that yesterday; I took a piece of paper and wrote in my habitual way, my old way. While I was writing, the feeling that it wasn't right came in; then I added a comment, written in the same manner, with the vision from above (a comment on a letter written by the person I was writing to). When that was done, the feeling of inadequacy lingered, so I took another piece of paper ‚Äì it was blue ‚Äì and wrote something... and that still wasn't it. So I ended up taking yet another piece of paper and writing something else again... then I put all three in one envelope! I hope that person has a solid head!... But at the same time something was telling me, ‚ÄúIt will do him good‚Äù; so I let it go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1518">It happened yesterday ‚Äì I don't yet know the outcome!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1519">It's obviously a very good test of people's trust, because without trust they would....

I had been invited to dinner by a cousin who, with no warning, served me dry champagne during dinner ‚Äì and I drank it unsuspectingly (I who never drank at all, neither wine nor liquor!).... When I had to get up and cross the crowded room, oh, how very difficult it became, so difficult! Then we went to a place near the chateau, with a view of the whole park. And I was staring at the park, when I saw... I saw the park filling up with lights (the electric lights had vanished), with all kinds of lights, torches, lanterns... and then crowds of people walking about... in Louis XIV dress! I was staring at this with my eyes wide open, holding on to the balustrade to keep from falling down (I wasn't too sure of myself!). I was seeing it all, then I saw myself there, engrossed in conversation with some people (I don't remember now, but there were certain ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù here too)....

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1561">There was another time at Blois. They make Anjou wine at Blois.

(<em>laughing</em> ‚Äì a scene where I was being strangled and thrown into a canal!) that my mother had to hurry me out of there as fast as she could! But that experience I wrote down, so the exact memory has been kept (I didn't write down the other experiences, so the details have all faded away, but this one was noted, although I didn't include any names). The next morning I did some research and uncovered the whole story. I told it all to Th√©on and Madame Th√©on, and he also had the memory of a past life there, during the same period.

Sometimes there was a fairly central presence and then at the same time less central, less important emanations. But that has happened several times ‚Äì several times. On two occasions it was particularly clear. But I have often sensed that there wasn't merely <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> embodiment, that the course of history may have crystallized around this or that person, but there were other embodiments less (how to put it?)... less conspicuous, somewhere else.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1572">None of those beings, those gods and deities of various pantheons, have the same rapport with the Supreme that man has; for man has a psychic being, in other words, the Supreme's presence within him.

They don't have the conscious link with the Supreme that man has ‚Äì man carries the Supreme within himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1573">That makes a considerable difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1574">But with this present incarnation of the Mahashakti.... She is the Supreme's first manifestation, creation's first stride, and it was She who first gave form to all those beings.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1575">Human experience, with this direct incarnation of the Supreme,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="125" href="#">9</a> is ultimately a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNIQUE</span> experience, which has given a new orientation to universal history.

And it wasn't that something acted on her consciously, deliberately, to obtain that result: it has been a contagion. I remember how she used to come, and my aspiration would be so intense, my inner attitude so concentrated... and one day there was such a sense of power, of immensity, of ineffable bliss in the contact with the Supreme (it was a day when Durga was there), and she seemed to be taken and absorbed in it.

<p class="footnote" id="fn-119"><sup>3</sup> Mother later tried to recall the names again, without success: ‚ÄúThose sculptor brothers did a lot of work on the palace at Versailles.... And I am not sure if it wasn't Mme de Montespan. I don't remember any more. This kind of thing should not be talked about vaguely. At the time it was precise, exact: I knew all the names, all the details, all the words ‚Äì but I never wrote it down and now it's gone. And these things shouldn't be told approximately.<br/>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-124"><sup>8</sup> Some days later, Satprem again brought up the above passage, asking whether the Mother hadn't been active on earth since the beginning of time and not merely ‚Äúwith this present incarnation of the Mahashakti.‚Äù The reply: ‚ÄúIt was always through EMANATIONS, while now it's as Sri Aurobindo writes in <em>Savitri</em> ‚Äì the Supreme tells Savitri that a day will come when the earth is ready and 'The Mighty Mother shall take birth'.... But Savitri was already on earth ‚Äì she was an emanation.<br>
<em>So they were all emanations?</em><br>
   They were all emanations, right from the beginning. So we have to say: 'With the PRESENT incarnation.'‚Äù</br></br></p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-125"><sup>9</sup> I.e., with the psychic being or soul IN MAN, the direct incarnation of the Supreme in man: ‚ÄúThis has come with humankind.‚Äù</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-126"><sup>10</sup> Satprem subsequently asked Mother:<br/>
<em>You almost seem to be saying that during the Vedic era there was no divine presence in man!</em><br/>
   No, there wasn't! They discovered it.<br/>
Humanity has undergone a spiritual evolution.<br/>
 Vedism is in contact with the gods and, THROUGH THE GODS, with the Supreme; but it is not in direct contact with the Supreme ‚Äì there is no inner, psychic contact. That's what Sri Aurobindo says (I myself know nothing about it!). But with the Vedanta and the devotees of Krishna, it is the god within: they had a direct contact with the god within (as in the <em>Gita</em>).</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-127"><sup>11</sup> Shortly afterwards, Satprem asked:<br/>
<em>When a god takes a human body it must be terrible for him. Or does his divinity become quite veiled to him?</em><br/>
  Yes, quite veiled.<br/>
  They are powerful beings, they give a sense of power, but it is quite veiled.<br/>
  But Krishna had a human body, Shiva had a human body.<br/>
<em>But supposing one of those gods were to incarnate in the present world ... well, it wouldn't be much fun‚Äîhe would suffocate.</em><br/>
  Fun?... No, you see, they extend sufficiently beyond the limits of their bodies so as not to be suffocated.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1594">As you know, N.S. has left his body. It was the result of an accident (he had a weak heart, and he worried about it). He took a fall, probably because he fainted, and fractured his skull: ‚Äúloss of consciousness‚Äù due to cerebral hemorrhage (that's modern science speaking!). When the accident occurred, he came to me (not in a precise form, but in a state of consciousness I immediately recognized), and stayed here motionless, in complete trust and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 241</p>
<p class="PE"> blissful peace ‚Äì motionless in every state of being, absolutely... <em>(gesture of surrender)</em> total, total trust: what will be, will be; what is, is. No questions, not even a need to know. A cosy peace... a <em>great ease</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1595">They tried, fought, operated: no movement, nothing moved. Then one day they declared him dead (by the way, according to doctors, when the body dies the heart beats on faintly for a few seconds; then it stops and it's all over). In his case, those faint beats (not strong enough to pump blood) continued for half an hour ‚Äì the kind of heartbeats typical of the trance state. (They all seem to be crassly ignorant! But anyway, it doesn't matter.) And they all said, even the doctors, ‚ÄúOooh, he must be a great yogi, this only happens to yogis!‚Äù I have no idea what they mean by that. But I do know that although those heartbeats aren't strong enough to pump blood through the body (thus putting the body into a cataleptic state), they do suffice to maintain life, and that's how yogis can remain in trance for months on end. Well, I don't know what type of doctors they are (probably very modern), but they're ignorant of this fact. Anyway, according to them he had those pulsations for half an hour (normally they last a few seconds). All right. Hence their remarks. And he was here the whole while, immutable. Then suddenly I felt a kind of shudder; I looked ‚Äì he was gone. I was busy and didn't note the time, but it was in the afternoon, that's all I know. Later I was told that they had decided to cremate him, and had done so at that time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1596">The violence of the accident had brutally exteriorized him, but when it happened he must have been thinking of me with trust. He came and didn't budge ‚Äì he never knew what was happening to his body. He didn't know he was dead! And if....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1597">Then and there I said to myself, ‚ÄúThis habit of cremating people is appallingly brutal!‚Äù (They put the fire in the mouth first.) He didn't know he was dead and that's how he learned it!... From the reaction of the life of the form in the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1598">Even when the body is in a thoroughly bad condition, it takes at least seven days for the life of the form to leave it.

So when people say, ‚ÄúI want to see you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI see you,‚Äù they mean the aspect of mine they know. But these torrents of forms are <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL</span> true, and most of them truer than this body has ever been.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1610">It had its good qualities (I seem bent on speaking in the past tense ‚Äì it's spontaneous), qualities it was built and chosen for. For practical purposes, this body was very necessary, but when it comes to manifesting!...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1612">There has never been too great an attachment to this form.

It's not even too good an instrument; simply modest, plastic, self-effacing, and molding itself to every necessity. An ability to mold itself to all points of view and to realize every ideal it deemed worthy of realizing ‚Äì this very suppleness was its one virtue. And extremely modest, never wanting to impose itself on anything or anyone. Fully conscious of its incapacity, but... capable of doing anything, of realizing anything. It was consciously formed with this make-up, because that's what was necessary.... And nothing is too great or overwhelming, since there isn't the resistance put up by a small personality with the sense of its own smallness.

It would have been entirely different, for instance, and far more serious, for someone who had practiced hatha yoga. But I mean to say that N.S. was here beside me, fully conscious, and could have moved on to another mode of manifestation without having to go through the throes of death ‚Äì that's not at all indispensable!

<p class="p-num">Page 245</p>
<p class="PE"> Besides, this is the first time it has happened. All those (like I.B., for example) who were hurled violently out of their bodies through an accident have, after a time, become conscious again ‚Äì the consciousness gathers itself back together. But N.S.'s consciousness never scattered, he never lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1624">His time had come ‚Äì the instant the accident happened, I knew it was time for him to leave his body. His time had come, but the circumstances had been arranged (‚Äúhad been arranged‚Äù ‚Äì you know, I don't say by whom...), circumstances had been arranged to derive the utmost benefit. This made me understand a lot of things.... Practically speaking, you need a lot of experiences to learn anything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1625">But to learn, to profit from such experiences, one must already be on the other side.

They're always rushing as if they had a train to catch! But why!... It's one of the big, big mistakes. Why rush? It's due to a sort of inner vibration, something that keeps vibrating on and on, spoiling everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1630">Everything they do, they do fast, as if something were pushing them ‚Äì they eat fast, move fast, sleep fast, they wash and dress fast, talk fast. But why? Why be in such a hurry?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1710">Some of the people concerned are here, others elsewhere ‚Äì that is, it's the mental state (even the higher mind in some cases, not necessarily very down-to-earth) of this one or that one or....

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1712">Probably they were not immediately aware of it, but it's sure to have an effect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1713">This has never happened before, it's brand-new. Before, there was always that Power transmitted through the higher mind (what Sri Aurobindo calls the Overmind); it was up there, dissolving, dispersing, changing, doing a whole lot of work, without any difficulty, effortlessly <em>(gesture above the head showing the tranquil, irresistible flowing of a stream)</em>, nothing to it.

What is striking about Mother's experience is this LEVEL movement, indicating that she had not left the physical world.

<p class="footnote" id="fn-139"><sup>4</sup> Ever since Einstein's Theory of Relativity, we have known that such an experience of time's relative nature is ‚Äúphysically‚Äù feasible. We need only consider the example of time aboard a spaceship approaching the speed of light: time ‚Äúslows down,‚Äù and the <em>same</em> event will take less time aboard the spaceship than on earth. In this instance, <em>speed</em> is what makes time slow down. In Mother's experience (which is every bit as ‚Äúphysical‚Äù), the ‚Äúintensity of the Presence‚Äù seems to be the origin of time change. In other words, consciousness is what makes time slow down. Thus we are witnessing two experiences with identical physical results, but formulated in different languages. In one, we speak of ‚Äúspeed,‚Äù in the other of ‚Äúconsciousness.‚Äù But what is speed, after all?... (Moreover, the implications of this ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù difference are quite colossal, for it would indeed be simpler to press on a ‚Äúconsciousness button‚Äù than on an accelerator that had to take us to the speed of light.) Speed is a question of distance. Distance is a question of two legs or two wings: it implies a limited phenomenon or a limited being. When we say ‚Äúat the speed of light,‚Äù we imagine our two legs or our two wings moving very, very fast. And all the phenomena of the universe are seen and conceived of in relation to these two legs, these two wings or this rocketship ‚Äì they are creations of our present-day biped biology. But for a being (a supramental being, of the future biology) containing everything within himself, who is immediately everywhere, without distance, where is ‚Äúspeed‚Äù?... The <em>only</em> ‚Äúspeed of light‚Äù is biped. Speed increases and time slows down, they say. The future biology says: consciousness intensifies and time slows down or ceases to exist ‚Äì distances are abolished, the body doesn't age. And the world's whole physical cage collapses. ‚ÄúTime is a rhythm of consciousness,‚Äù says Mother. We change rhythm and the <em>physical</em> world changes.

And the very intensity of the aspiration brings in the possibility of a slight emotional vibration. But it is immediately drowned in... the immobile immensity of matter, which senses the Divine Descent like a leaven that makes dough rise ‚Äì that's it exactly, the terrestrial immensity of matter and the leavening action of the Divine Descent.... The intensity of these vibrations is above and beyond anything we are used to feeling ‚Äì the vital seems dull and flat in comparison. And what a Wisdom!...

The machine would simply explode. But this Wisdom doesn't come from the universal consciousness (which I don't really think is so wise!), it's infinitely higher: the Supreme Wisdom.

<p class="PE"> ‚Äì the body's consciousness is much larger than my body. Yesterday, the table leg bumped my foot; so there was the ordinary outward reaction (it operates automatically and in a curious way ‚Äì the body jumped), and then the body-consciousness ‚Äì now I am speaking of the body-consciousness ‚Äì saw that an unexpected and involuntary collision of two objects had taken place <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INSIDE ITSELF</span>. And it also saw that if it made a certain movement of concentration at that particular spot, inside itself, some pain or damage would result; but if it made the other movement of... (how shall I put it?) of union, of abolishing all separation (which it can do very well), well, then the results of the blow would be annulled. And that's what happened, I did it. I was simply sitting down, and I let my body cope with the whole thing (while I watched with keen interest); and I noticed it really did feel the blow inside and not outside ‚Äì it wasn't that something from outside had struck it, but that there had been an unexpected, or rather an unforeseen and involuntary collision of two things inside itself. And I clearly followed how the body made a more complete movement of identification (you see, someone with the sense of separation had moved the table, so the sense of separation accompanied the blow, and then of course there was all the regret,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="142" href="#">2</a> and so on and so forth); well, the body simply went into its usual state where there's no sense of separation, and the effect vanished instantaneously. Had I been asked, ‚ÄúWhere were you hit, what spot?‚Äù, I couldn't have told, I don't know. All I know, because of words I heard spoken, is that the table leg bumped into my foot. But where?...

<p class="Q">April 7, 1920</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1828">Dear Barin,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1829">I have your letter, but have not succeeded in writing an answer till now. That I have even sat down to write now is a miracle; for me to write a letter is an event that takes place once in a blue moon ‚Äì especially to write in Bengali, a thing I have not done for five or six years. If I can manage to finish this letter and put it in the post, the miracle will be complete!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1830">First, about your yoga. You wish to give me the charge of your yoga and I am willing to take it, but that means to give its charge to Him who is moving by His divine <em>Shakti</em> <span class="note_0">[Energy]</span>, whether secretly or openly, both you and me. But you must know that the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 269</p>
<p class="PE"> necessary result of this will be that you will have to walk in the special path which He has given to me, the path which I call the path of the Integral Yoga. What I began with, what Lele<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="143" href="#">1</a> gave me, was a seeking for the path, a circling in many directions ‚Äì a first touch, a taking up, a handling and scrutiny of this or that in all the old partial yogas, some sort of complete experience of one and then the pursuit of another.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1831">Afterwards, when I came to Pondicherry, this unsteady condition came to an end. The Guru of the world who is within us then gave me complete directions for my path ‚Äì its complete theory, the ten limbs of the body of this Yoga. These past ten years He has been making me develop it in experience, and this is not yet finished. It may take another two years, and as long as it is not finished I doubt if I shall be able to return to Bengal. Pondicherry is the appointed place for my yoga <em>siddhi</em> <span class="note_0">[realization]</span>, except indeed one part of it, and that is action. The centre of my work is Bengal, although I hope that its circumference will be all India and the whole earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1832">I shall write and tell you afterwards what this way of yoga is. Or if you come here I shall speak to you about it. In this matter the spoken word is better than the written. At present I can only say that its root-principle is to make a harmony and unity of complete knowledge, complete works and complete <em>Bhakti</em> <span class="note_0">[Devotion]</span>, to raise all this above the mind and give it its complete perfection on the supramental level of <em>Vijnana</em> <span class="note_0">[Gnosis]</span>. This was the defect of the old yoga ‚Äì the mind and the Spirit it knew, and it was satisfied with the experience of the Spirit in the mind. But the mind can grasp only the divided and partial; it cannot wholly seize the infinite and indivisible. The mind's means to reach the infinite are <em>Sannyasa</em> <span class="note_0">[Renunciation]</span>, <em>Moksha</em> <span class="note_0">[Liberation]</span> and Nirvana, and it has no others. One man or another may indeed attain this featureless Moksha, but what is the gain? The Brahman, the Self, God are ever present. What God wants in man is to embody Himself here in the individual and in the community, to realize God in life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1833">The old way of yoga failed to bring about the harmony or unity of Spirit and life: it instead dismissed the world as <em>Maya</em> <span class="note_0">[Illusion]</span> or a transient Play. The result has been loss of life-power and the degeneration of India. As was said in the Gita, ‚ÄúThese peoples</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 270</p>
<p class="PE"> would perish if I did not do works‚Äù ‚Äì these peoples of India have truly gone down to ruin. A few <em>sannyasins</em> and <em>bairagis</em> <span class="note_0">[renunciants]</span> to be saintly and perfect and liberated, a few <em>bhaktas</em> <span class="note_0">[lovers of God]</span> to dance in a mad ecstasy of love and sweet emotion and <em>Ananda</em> <span class="note_0">[Bliss]</span>, and a whole race to become lifeless, void of intelligence, sunk in deep <em>tamas</em> <span class="note_0">[inertia]</span> ‚Äì is this the effect of true spirituality? No, we must first attain all the partial experiences possible on the mental level and flood the mind with spiritual delight and illumine it with spiritual light, but afterwards we must rise above. If we cannot rise above, to the supramental level, that is, it is hardly possible to know the world's final secret and the problem it raises remains unsolved. There, the ignorance which creates a duality of opposition between the Spirit and Matter, between truth of spirit and truth of life, disappears. There one need no longer call the world Maya. The world is the eternal Play of God, the eternal manifestation of the Self. Then it becomes possible to fully know and fully realize God ‚Äì to do what is said in the Gita, ‚ÄúTo know Me integrally.‚Äù The physical body, the life, the mind and understanding, the supermind and the Ananda ‚Äì these are the spirit's five levels. The higher man rises on this ascent the nearer he comes to the state of that highest perfection open to his spiritual evolution. Rising to the Supermind, it becomes easy to rise to the Ananda. One attains a firm foundation in the condition of the indivisible and infinite Ananda, not only in the timeless <em>Parabrahman</em> <span class="note_0">[Absolute]</span> but in the body, in life, in the world. The integral being, the integral consciousness, the integral Ananda blossoms out and takes form in life. This is the central clue of my yoga, its fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1834">This is no easy change to make. After these fifteen years I am only now rising into the lowest of the three levels of the Supermind and trying to draw up into it all the lower activities. But when this siddhi will be complete, then I am absolutely certain that through me God will give to others the siddhi of the Supermind with less effort. Then my real work will begin. I am not impatient for success in the work. What is to happen will happen in God's appointed time. I have no hasty or disorderly impulse to rush into the field of work in the strength of the little ego. Even if I did not succeed in my work I would not be shaken. This work is not mine but God's. I will listen to no other call; when God moves me then I will move.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1835">I know very well that Bengal is not really ready. The spiritual flood which has come is for the most part a new form of the old</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 271</p>
<p class="PE"> ¬† It is not the real transformation. However this too was needed. Bengal has been awakening in itself the old yogas and exhausting their <em>samskaras</em> <span class="note_0">[old habitual tendencies]</span>, extracting their essence and with it fertilizing the soil. At first it was the time of Vedanta ‚Äì Adwaita, Sannyasa, Shankara's Maya and the rest. It is now the turn of Vaishnava Dharma ‚Äì Lila, love, the intoxication of emotional experience. All this is very old, unfitted for the new age and will not endure ‚Äì for such excitement has no capacity to last. But the merit of the Vaishnava <em>Bhava</em> <span class="note_0">[emotional enthusiasm]</span> is that it keeps a connexion between God and the world and gives a meaning to life; but since it is a partial bhava the whole connexion, the full meaning is not there. The tendency to create sects which you have noticed was inevitable. The nature of the mind is to take a part and call it the whole and exclude all other parts. The <em>Siddha</em> <span class="note_0">[illuminated being]</span> who brings the bhava, although he leans on its partial aspect, yet keeps some knowledge of the integral whole, even though he may not be able to give it form. But his disciples do not get that knowledge precisely because it is not in a form. They are tying up their little bundles, let them. The bundles will open of themselves when God manifests himself fully. These things are the signs of incompleteness and immaturity. I am not disturbed by them. Let the force of spirituality play in the country in whatever way and in as many sects as may be. Afterwards we shall see. This is the infancy or the embryonic condition of the new age. It is a first hint, not even the beginning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1836">* The peculiarity of this yoga is that until there is siddhi above the foundation does not become perfect. Those who have been following my course had kept many of the old samskaras; some of them have dropped away, but others still remain. There was the samskara of Sannyasa, even the wish to create an <em>Aravinda Math</em> <span class="note_0">[Sri Aurobindo monastery]</span>. Now the intellect has recognized that Sannyasa is not what is wanted, but the stamp of the old idea has not yet been effaced from the <em>prana</em> <span class="note_0">[breath, life energy]</span>. And so there was next this talk of remaining in the midst of the world, as a man of worldly activities and yet a man of renunciation. The necessity of renouncing desire has been understood, but the harmony of renunciation of desire with enjoyment of Ananda has not been rightly seized by the mind. And they took up my Yoga because it was very natural to the Bengali temperament, not so much from the side of Knowledge as from the side of Bhakti and Karma <span class="note_0">[Works]</span>. A little knowledge has come in, but the greater part has escaped; the mist of sentimentalism has not been</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 272</p>
<p class="PE"> dissipated, the groove of the <em>sattwic bhava</em> <span class="note_0">[religious fervor]</span> has not been broken. There is still the ego. I am not in haste, I allow each to develop according to his nature. I do not want to fashion all in the same mould. That which is fundamental will indeed be one in all, but it will express itself in many forms. Everybody grows, forms from within. I do not want to build from outside. The basis is there, the rest will come.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1837">What I am aiming at is not a society like the present rooted in division. What I have in view is a <em>Samgha</em> <span class="note_0">[community]</span> founded in the spirit and in the image of its oneness. It is with this idea that the name <em>Deva Samgha</em> has been given ‚Äì the commune of those who want the divine life is the Deva Samgha. Such a Samgha will have to be established in one place at first and then spread all over the country. But if any shadow of egoism falls over this endeavor, then the Samgha will change into a sect. The idea may very naturally creep in that such and such a body is the one true Samgha of the future, the one and only centre, that all else must be its circumference, and that those outside its limits are not of the fold or even if they are, have gone astray, because they think differently.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1838">You may say, what need is there of a Samgha? Let me be free and live in every vessel; let all become one without form and let whatever must be happen in the midst of that vast formlessness. There is a truth there, but only one side of the truth. Our business is not with the formless Spirit alone; we have also to direct the movement of life. And there can be no effective movement of life without form. It is the Formless that has taken form and that assumption of name and form is not a caprice of Maya. Form is there because it is indispensable. We do not want to rule out any activity of the world as beyond our province. Politics, industry, society, poetry, literature, art will all remain, but we must give them a new soul and a new form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1839">Why have I left politics? Because the politics of the country is not a genuine thing belonging to India. It is an importation from Europe and an imitation. At one time there was a need of it. We also have done politics of the European kind. If we had not done it, the country would not have risen and we too would not have gained experience and attained full development. There is still some need of it, not so much in Bengal as in the other provinces of India. But the time has come to stop the shadow from extending and to seize on the reality. We must get to the true soul of India and in its image fashion all works.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1840">People now talk of spiritualizing politics. Its result will be, if</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 273</p>
<p class="PE"> there be any permanent result, some kind of Indianized Bolshevism. Even to that kind of work I have no objection. Let each man do according to his inspiration. But that is not the real thing. If one pours the spiritual power into all these impure forms ‚Äì the water of the Causal ocean into raw vessels ‚Äì either the raw vessels will break and the water will be spilt and lost or the spiritual power will evaporate and only the impure form remain. In all fields it is the same. I can give the spiritual power but that power will be expended in making the image of an ape and setting it up in the temple of Shiva. If the ape is endowed with life and made powerful, he may play the part of the devotee Hanuman and do much work for¬† Rama,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="144" href="#">2</a> so long as that life and that power remain. But what we want in the Temple of India is not Hanuman, but the god, the avatar, Rama himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1841">We can mix with all, but in order to draw all into the true path' keeping intact the spirit and form of our ideal. If we do not do that we shall lose our direction and the real work will not be done. If we remain individually everywhere, something will be done indeed; but if we remain everywhere as parts of a Samgha, a hundred times more will be done. As yet that time has not come. If we try to give a form hastily, it may not be the exact thing we want. The Samgha will at first be in unconcentrated form. Those who have the ideal will be united but work in different places. Afterwards, they will form something like a spiritual commune and make a compact Samgha. They will then give all their work a shape according to the demand of the spirit and the need of the age ‚Äì not a bound and rigid form, not an¬† achalayatana<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="145" href="#">3</a>, but a free form which will spread out like the sea, mould itself into many waves and surround a thing here, overflood a thing there and finally take all into itself. As we go on doing this there will be established a spiritual community. This is my present idea. As yet it has not been fully developed. All is in God's hands; whatever He makes us do, that we shall do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1842">Now let me discuss some particular points of your letter. I do not want to say much in this letter about what you have written as regards your yoga. We shall have better occasion when we meet. To look upon the body as a corpse is a sign of Sannyasa, of the path of Nirvana. You cannot be of the world with this idea. You</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 274</p>
<p class="PE"> must have delight in all things ‚Äì in the Spirit as well as in the body. The body has consciousness, it is God's form. When you see God in everything that is in the world, when you have this vision that all this is Brahman, <em>Sarvamidam Brahma</em>, that Vasudeva is all this ‚Äì <em>Vasudevah sarvamiti ‚Äì</em> then you have the universal delight. The flow of that delight precipitates and courses even through the body. When you are in such a state, full of the spiritual consciousness, you can lead a married life, a life in the world. In all your works you find the expression of God's delight. So far I have been transforming all the objects and perceptions of the mind and the senses into delight on the mental level. Now they are taking the form of the supramental delight. In this condition is the perfect vision and perception of <em>Sachchidananda</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1843">You write about the <em>Deva Samgha</em> and say, ‚ÄúI am not a god, I am only a piece of much hammered and tempered iron.‚Äù No one is a God but in each man there is a God and to make Him manifest is the aim of divine life. That we can all do. I recognize that there are great and small <em>adharas</em> <span class="note_0">[vessels]</span>. I do not accept, however, your description of yourself as accurate. Still whatever the nature of the vessel, once the touch of God is upon it, once the spirit is awake, great and small and all that does not make much difference. There may be more difficulties, more time may be taken, there may be a difference in the manifestation, but even about that there is no certainty. The God within takes no account of these hindrances and deficiencies. He breaks his way out. Was the amount of my failings a small one? Were there less obstacles in my mind and heart and vital being and body? Did it not take time? Has God hammered me less? Day after day, minute after minute, I have been fashioned into I know not whether a god or what. But I have become or am becoming something. That is sufficient, since God wanted to build it. It is the same as regards everyone. Not our strength but the Shakti of God is the <em>sadhaka</em> <span class="note_0">[worker]</span> of this yoga.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1844">Let me tell you in brief one or two things about what I have long seen. My idea is that the chief cause of the weakness of India is not subjection nor poverty, nor the lack of spirituality or <em>dharma</em> <span class="note_0">[ethics]</span> but the decline of thought-power, the growth of ignorance in the motherland of Knowledge. Everywhere I see inability or unwillingness to think ‚Äì thought-incapacity or thought-phobia. Whatever may have been in the middle ages, this state of things is now the sign of a terrible degeneration. The middle age was the night, the time of the victory of ignorance. The modern world is</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 275</p>
<p class="PE"> the age of the victory of Knowledge. Whoever thinks most, seeks most, labors most, can fathom and learn the truth of the world, and gets so much more Shakti. If you look at Europe, you will see two things: a vast sea of thought and the play of a huge and fast-moving and yet disciplined force. The whole Shakti of Europe is in that. And in the strength of that Shakti it has been swallowing up the world, like the <em>tapaswins</em> <span class="note_0">[ascetics]</span> of our ancient times, by whose power even the gods of the world were terrified, held in suspense and subjection. People say Europe is running into the jaws of destruction. I do not think so. All these revolutions and upsettings are the preconditions of a new creation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1845">Then look at India. Except for some solitary giants, everywhere there is your ‚Äúsimple man,‚Äù that is, the average man who does not want to think and cannot think, who has not the least Shakti but only a temporary excitement. In India, you want the simple thought, the easy ‚Äúword.‚Äù In Europe they want the deep thought, the deep ‚Äúword‚Äù; there even an ordinary laborer or artisan thinks, wants to know, is not satisfied with surface things but wants to go behind. But there is still this difference: there is a fatal limitation in the strength and thought of Europe. When it comes into the spiritual field, its thought-power can no longer move ahead. There Europe sees everything as riddle ‚Äì nebulous metaphysics, yogic hallucination. They rub their eyes as in smoke and can see nothing clear. Still, some effort is being made in Europe to surmount even this limitation. We already have the spiritual sense ‚Äì we owe it to our forefathers ‚Äì and whoever has that sense has at his disposal such Knowledge and Shakti as with one breath might blow away all the huge power of Europe like a blade of grass. But to get that Shakti one must be a worshiper of Shakti. We are not worshipers of Shakti. We are worshipers of the easy way. But Shakti is not to be had by the easy way. Our forefathers dived into a sea of vast thought and gained a vast Knowledge and established a mighty civilization. As they went on in their way, fatigue and weariness came upon them. The force of thought diminished and with it also the strong current of Shakti. Our civilization has become an <em>achalayatana</em> <span class="note_0">[prison]</span>, our religion a bigotry of externals, our spirituality a faint glimmer of light or a momentary wave of religious intoxication. And so long as this sort of thing continues, any permanent resurgence of India is improbable</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1846">In Bengal this weakness has gone to the extreme. The Bengali has a quick intelligence, emotional capacity and intuition. He is foremost in India in all these qualities. All of them are necessary</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 276</p>
<p class="PE"> but they do not suffice. If to these there were added depth of thought, calm strength, heroic courage and a capacity for and pleasure in prolonged labor, the Bengali might be a leader not only of India, but of mankind. But he does not want that, he wants to get things done easily, to get knowledge without thinking, the fruits without labor, siddhi by an easy <em>sadhana</em> <span class="note_0">[discipline]</span>. His stock is the excitement of the emotional mind. But excess of emotion, empty of knowledge, is the very symptom of the malady. In the end it brings about fatigue and inertia. The country has been constantly and gradually going down. The life-power has ebbed away. What has the Bengali come to in his own country? He cannot get enough food to eat or clothes to wear, there is lamentation on all sides, his wealth, his trade and commerce, his lands, his very agriculture have begun to pass into the hands of others. We have abandoned the sadhana of Shakti and Shakti has abandoned us. We do the sadhana of Love, but where Knowledge and Shakti are not, there Love does not remain, there narrowness and littleness come, and in a little and narrow mind there is no place for Love. Where is Love in Bengal? There is more quarreling, jealousy, mutual dislike, misunderstanding and faction there than anywhere else even in India which is so much afflicted by division.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1847">In the noble heroic age of the¬† Aryan people<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="146" href="#">4</a> there was not so much shouting and gesticulating, but the endeavor they undertook remained steadfast through many centuries. The Bengali's endeavor lasts only for a day or two.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1848">You say that what is needed is maddening enthusiasm, to fill the country with emotional excitement. In the time of the <em>Swadeshi</em> <span class="note_0">[fight for independence, boycott of English goods]</span> we did all that in the field of politics, but what we did is all now in the dust. Will there be a more favorable result in the spiritual field? I do not say there has been no result. There has been. Any movement will produce some result, but for the most part in terms of an increase of possibility. This is not the right method, however, to steadily actualize the thing. Therefore I no longer wish to make emotional excitement or any intoxication of the mind the base. I wish to make a large and strong equanimity the foundation of the yoga. I want established on that equality a full, firm and undisturbed Shakti in the system and in all its movements. I want the wide display of the light of Knowledge in the ocean of Shakti. And I want in that luminous vastness the tranquil ecstasy of infinite Love, Delight</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 277</p>
<p class="PE"> and Oneness. I do not want hundreds of thousands of disciples. It will be enough if I can get a hundred complete men, purified of petty egoism, who will be the instruments of God. I have no faith in the customary trade of the guru. I do not wish to be a guru. If anybody wakes and manifests from within his slumbering godhead and gets the divine life ‚Äì be it at my touch or at another's ‚Äì this is what I want. It is such men that will raise the country.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1849">You must not think from all this lecture that I despair of the future of Bengal. I too hope, as they say, that this time a great light will manifest itself in Bengal. Still I have tried to show the other side of the shield, where the fault is, the error, the deficiency. If these remain, the light will not be a great light and it will not be permanent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1850">The meaning of this extraordinarily long talk is that I too am packing my bag. But I believe that this bundle is like the net of St. Peter, only crammed with the catch of the Infinite. I am not going to open the bag now. If I do that before its time, all would escape. Neither am I going back to Bengal now, not because Bengal is not ready, but because I am not ready.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1860">Yes.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1861">In fact, if I look at the order my own yoga took.... When I was five years old (I must have begun earlier, but the memory is a bit vague and imprecise)... but from five onwards, in my consciousness (not a mental memory but ‚Äì how can I put it? ‚Äì it's noted, a notation in my consciousness)... well, I began with consciousness. Of course I had no idea what it was. But my first experience was of the consciousness here <em>(gesture above the head)</em>, which I felt like a Light and a Force; and I felt it there <em>(same gesture)</em> at the age of five.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1862">It was a very pleasant sensation. I would sit in a little armchair made especially for me, all alone in my room, and I... (I didn't know what it was, you see, not a thing, nothing ‚Äì mentally zero) and I had a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY PLEASANT</span> feeling of something very strong, very luminous, and it was here <em>(above the head)</em>. Consciousness. And I felt, ‚ÄúThat's what I have to live, what I have to be.‚Äù Not with all those words, naturally, but... <em>(Mother makes a gesture of aspiration Upward)</em>. Then I would pull it down, for it was... it was truly my raison d'√™tre.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1863">That is my first memory ‚Äì at five years old. Its impact was more on the ethical side than the intellectual; and yet it took an intellectual</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 279</p>
<p class="PE"> form too, since.... You see, apparently I was a child like any other, except that I was hard to handle. Hard in the sense that I had no interest in food, no interest in ordinary games, no liking for going to my friends' houses for snacks, because eating cake wasn't the least bit interesting! And it was impossible to punish me because I really couldn't have cared less: being deprived of dessert was rather a relief for me! And then I flatly refused to learn reading, I refused to learn. And even bathing me was very hard, because I was put in the care of an English governess, and that meant cold baths ‚Äì my brother took it in stride, but I just howled! Later it was found to be bad for me (the doctor said so), but that was much later. So you get the picture.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1864">But whenever there was unpleasantness with my relatives, with playmates or friends, I would feel all the nastiness or bad will ‚Äì all sorts of pretty ugly things that came (I was rather sensitive, for I instinctively nurtured an ideal of beauty and harmony, which all the circumstances of life kept denying)... so whenever I felt sad, I was most careful not to say anything to my mother or father, because my father didn't give a hoot and my mother would scold me ‚Äì that was always the first thing she did. And so I would go to my room and sit down in my little armchair, and there I could concentrate and try to understand... in my own way. And I remember that after quite a few probably fruitless attempts I wound up telling myself (I always used to talk to myself; I don't know why or how, but I would talk to myself just as I talked to others): ‚ÄúLook here, you feel sad because so-and-so said something really disgusting to you ‚Äì but why does that make you cry? Why are you so sad? He's the one who was bad, so he should be crying. You didn't do anything bad to him.... Did you tell him nasty things? Did you fight with her, or with him? No, you didn't do anything, did you; well then, you needn't feel sad. You should only be sad if you've done something bad, but....‚Äù So that settled it: I would never cry. With just a slight inward movement, or ‚Äúsomething‚Äù that said, ‚ÄúYou've done no wrong,‚Äù there was no sadness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1865">But there was another side to this ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù: it was watching me more and more, and as soon as I said one word or made one gesture too many, had one little bad thought, teased my brother or whatever, the smallest thing, it would say <em>(Mother takes on a severe tone)</em>, ‚ÄúLook out, be careful!‚Äù At first I used to moan about it, but by and by it taught me: ‚ÄúDon't lament ‚Äì put right, mend.‚Äù And when things could be mended ‚Äì as they almost always could ‚Äì I would do so. All that on a five to seven-year-old child's scale of intelligence.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 280</p>
<p class="PE"> So it was consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1866">Next came the period of learning and developing, but on an ordinary mental level ‚Äì school years.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="149" href="#">1</a> Curiosity made me want to learn to read. Did I tell you how it happened? When I was around seven, just under seven, my brother, who was eighteen months older, used to bring big pictures home from school with him (you know, pictures for children with captions at the bottom; they're still used nowadays) and he gave me one of them. ‚ÄúWhat's written there?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúRead it!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon't know how,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúThen learn!‚Äù ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù I told him, ‚Äúshow me the letters.‚Äù He brought me an A-B-C book. I knew it within two days and on the third day I started reading. That's how I learned. ‚ÄúOh-oh,‚Äù they used to say, ‚Äúthis child is backward! Seven years old and she still can't read ‚Äì disgraceful!‚Äù The whole family fretted about it. And then lo and behold, in about a week I knew what should have taken me years to learn ‚Äì it made them think twice!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1867">Then, school years. I was a very bright student, always for the same reason: I wanted to understand. I wasn't interested in learning things by heart like the others did ‚Äì I wanted to understand them. And what a memory I had, a fantastic memory for sounds and images! I had only to read a poem aloud at night, and the next morning I knew it. And after I had studied or read a book and someone mentioned a passage to me, I would say, ‚ÄúAh, yes ‚Äì that's on page so and so.‚Äù I would find the page. Nothing had faded, it was all still fresh. But this is the ordinary period of development.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1868">Then at a very young age (about eight or ten), along with my studies I began to paint. At twelve I was already doing portraits. All aspects of art and beauty, but particularly music and painting, fascinated me. I went through a very intense vital development during that period, with, just like in my early years, the presence of a kind of inner Guide; and all centered on studies: the study of sensations, observations, the study of technique, comparative studies, even a whole spectrum of observations dealing with taste, smell and hearing ‚Äì a kind of classification of experiences. And this extended to all facets of life, all the experiences life can bring, all of them ‚Äì miseries, joys, difficulties, sufferings, everything ‚Äì oh, a whole field of studies! And always this presence within,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 281</p>
<p class="PE"> judging, deciding, classifying, organizing and systematizing everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1869">Then conscious yoga made a sudden entry into the picture when I met Th√©on; I must have been about twenty-one. Life's orientation changed, a whole series of experiences took place, with the development of the vital giving interesting occult results.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1870">Then, a period of intensive mental development, mental development of the most complete type: a study of all the philosophies, all the conceptual juggling, in minute detail ‚Äì delving into systems, getting a grasp on them. Ten years of intensive mental studies leading me to... Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1871">So I had all this preparation. And I am giving you these details simply to tell you it all began with consciousness (I knew very well what consciousness was, even before I had any word or idea to explain it), consciousness and its force ‚Äì its force of action, its force of execution. Next, a detailed study and thorough development of the vital. After that, mental development taken to its uppermost limit, where you can juggle with all ideas; a developmental stage where it's already understood that all ideas are true and that there's a synthesis to be made, and that beyond the synthesis lies something luminous and true. And behind it all, a continual consciousness. Such was my state when I came here: I'd had a world of experiences and had already attained conscious union with the Divine above and within ‚Äì all of it consciously realized, carefully noted and so forth ‚Äì when I came to Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1872">From the standpoint of <em>shakti</em>, this is the normal course: consciousness, vital, mental and spiritual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1873">Is it different for men? I don't know. Sri Aurobindo's case was quite special, and apart from him I don't see any convincing example. But generally speaking, what is most developed in a man, along with the mind, is the physical consciousness; the vital is very impulsive, practically ungoverned. That's my experience of the hundreds and hundreds of men I have met. There's normally a physical strength built up through games and exercises, and side by side a more or less advanced, but primarily mental development, very mental. The vital is terribly impulsive and barely organized, except in artists, and even there.... I lived among artists for ten years and found this ground to be mostly fallow. I mingled with all the great artists of the time, I was like a kid sister to them (it was at the turn of the century, with the Universal Exposition in 1900; and these were the leading artists of the epoch); so I was by far the youngest, much younger than any of them ‚Äì they were all thirty, thirty-five,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 282</p>
<p class="PE"> forty years old, while I was nineteen or twenty. Well I was much more advanced in their own field ‚Äì not in what I was producing (I was a perfectly ordinary artist), but from the viewpoint of consciousness: observations, experiences, studies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1874">I am not sure, but it seems to me that the problem of consciousness ought to come first.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1875"><em>That's how I had started to do it.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1876">Well, I think so. What happened to me in life is extremely logical, very, very logical (it wasn't me, I didn't decide anything ‚Äì you don't make decisions at the age of five). Each stage was prepared by the preceding one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1877"><em>But then what is this consciousness we feel like a force inside us? For instance, sometimes in meditation it rises, then descends; it's not fixed anywhere. What is this consciousness?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1878">The Shakti!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1879">Some receive it from above; for others, it rises from below <em>(gesture to the base of the spine)</em>. As I once told you, the old system always proceeds from below upwards, while Sri Aurobindo pulls from above downwards. This becomes very clear in meditation (well, in yoga, in yogic experience): for those who follow the old system, it's invariably the <em>kundalini</em> at the base <span class="note_0">[of the spine]</span> rising from center to center, center to center, until the lotus <em>(in an ironic tone)</em> bursts open here <em>(gesture at the crown of the head)</em>. With Sri Aurobindo, it comes like this <em>(gesture of descending Force)</em> and then settles here <em>(above the head);</em> it enters, and from there it comes down, down, down, everywhere, to the very bottom, and even below the feet ‚Äì the subconscient ‚Äì and lower still, the inconscient.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1880">It's the Shakti. He said, you know (I am still translating it), that the shakti drawn up from below (this is what happens in the individual process) is already what could be called a ‚Äúveiled‚Äù shakti (it has power, but it is veiled). While the Shakti drawn down from above is a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PURE</span> Shakti; and if it can be brought down carefully and slowly enough so that it isn't (how shall I put it?) polluted or, in any case, obscured as it enters matter, then the result is immediately much better. As he has explained, if you start out with this feeling of a great power in yourself (because it's always a great power no matter where it awakens), there's inevitably a danger of the ego meddling in. But if it comes pure and you are very careful</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 283</p>
<p class="PE"> to keep it pure, not to rush the movement but let it purify as it descends, then half the work is done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1881"><em>It's a problem. When you contact the Supraconscient and the Shakti emerges at the crown of the head, it's something rising from below, isn't it? Is it then another movement, an ascending movement...?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1882">That is the consciousness of the <em>jiva</em> <span class="note_0">[soul]</span>, the personal, individual consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1883"><em>It's something that grows....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1884">It is the individual consciousness. Aspiration is almost always an expression of the psychic being ‚Äì the part of us that's organized around the divine center, the small divine flame deep within human beings. You see, this divine flame exists inside each human being, and little by little, through all the incarnations and karma and so on, a being takes shape around it, which Th√©on called the ‚Äúpsychic being.‚Äù And when the psychic being reaches its full development, it becomes a kind of bodily or at any rate individual raiment of the soul. The soul is a portion of the Supreme ‚Äì the jiva is the Supreme in individual form. And since there is only one Supreme, there is only one jiva, but with millions of individual forms. This jiva begins as a divine spark ‚Äì immutable, eternal and infinite too (infinite in possibility rather than dimension). And through all the incarnations, whatever has received and responded to the divine Influence progressively crystallizes around the jiva, which becomes more and more conscious as well as more and more organized. Ultimately it becomes a completely conscious individual being, master of itself and moved exclusively by the divine Will. That is to say, an individual expression of the Supreme. This is what we call the ‚Äúpsychic being.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1885">Generally speaking, those who practice yoga have either a fully developed, independent psychic being which has taken birth again to do the Divine's work, or else a psychic being in its last incarnation wanting to complete its development and realize itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1886">This is what aspires, this is what has the contact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1887">So, when you're told ‚Äúbecome conscious of your psychic being,‚Äù it's for the being formed by external Nature to contact the divine Presence through the psychic being. Then the psychic takes charge of the whole being; in fact, it is the inner Guide.... Well, when I</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 284</p>
<p class="PE"> was a little child, this ‚Äúperson‚Äù (which wasn't a person, but an expression of a certain consciousness and will) was actually the psychic presence; there was something else behind, but that's a rather special case. And what happened to me happens to everyone whose psychic being has deliberately incarnated: the psychic being guides your life, and if you let it act freely, it arranges <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL</span> circumstances ‚Äì it's truly wonderful!... I have seen ‚Äì not only for myself but for so many people who also had conscious psychic beings ‚Äì that everything is arranged with a view to... not at all your personal egoistic satisfaction, but your ultimate progress and realization. And all circumstances of life, even those you call ‚Äúdisastrous,‚Äù are there to lead you where you have to go as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1888">Yours is more than a psychic being. As I have told you, your psychic being is accompanied by something which has come for a special purpose, with a particular intellectual power ‚Äì a luminous, conscious power ‚Äì which has come from regions higher than the mind, regions Sri Aurobindo calls the Overmind, to do a special work. It is here <em>(gesture enveloping the chest and head)</em> and, along with the psychic, it's trying to organize everything. This, in your psychic, is what you are feeling. It must have great power.... Don't you feel a kind of luminous force?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1889"><em>Oh, yes, I feel it!</em></p>

If thoughts or activities come, they do not rise at all out of the mind, but they come from outside and cross the mind as a flight of birds crosses the sky in a windless air. It passes, disturbs nothing, leaving no trace. Even if a thousand images or the most violent events pass across it, the calm stillness remains as if the very texture of the mind were a substance of eternal and indestructible peace. A mind that has achieved this calmness can begin to act, even intensely and powerfully, but it will keep its fundamental stillness ‚Äì originating nothing from itself but receiving from Above and giving it a mental form without adding anything of its own, calmly, dispassionately, though with the joy of the Truth and the happy power and light of its passage.‚Äù (Cent.

<p class="Ps"><em>(Mother refers back to the last conversation, where she spoke of her different stages of development.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1954">I have seen that the different stages of my development occurred in twelve-year periods, though I don't recall the exact dates. The first period, from the age of five (I can't start earlier than five!) to about eighteen, dealt with consciousness. Then came all the artistic and vital development, culminating in the occult development with Th√©on (I met Th√©on around 1905 or '06, I think<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="155" href="#">1</a>). Then right around this time an intensive mental development began ‚Äì from 1908 to 1920, or a little before; but it was especially intense before coming here in 1914.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1955">And 1920 marked the beginning of full development. Not spiritual development ‚Äì that had been going on from the very start ‚Äì</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 291</p>
<p class="PE"> but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ACTION</span>, the action with Sri Aurobindo. That was clearly from 1920 on; I had met Sri Aurobindo earlier, but it really began in 1920.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="156" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1956"><em>And the realization of the inner Divine?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1957">The dates... I am no good at dates! And I don't have any papers left to give me precise details. But the realization of the inner Divine must have been in 1911, because that's when I started writing my Meditations.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="157" href="#">3</a> But since my earliest childhood, you know, this presence was always there, with an initial emphasis on consciousness, then on the vital and aesthetics, then on the mind... and culminating here, in 1920, with action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1958">From 1911 or '12, up to 1914, there was the whole series of inner experiences, psychic experiences, preparing me to meet Sri Aurobindo (so this ran parallel to my mental development).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1959">In practice, these periods overlap, but approximately every twelve years a particular type of development predominated, in this order: consciousness first, then the vital (mainly from the aesthetic point of view, but a study of sensations as well), then the mind, then spiritual realization. And in between the vital and mental phases came the brief period of occultism, serving both as a transition and a basis for spiritual development.</p>

Some are very upsetting to the body, and some even feel dangerous. On the other hand, certain ones make the body receptive to the vibration, which we might call ‚Äúthe Lord's Vibration,‚Äù the supreme Vibration. You see, all this is the outcome of a discipline, a tapasya, for preparing the body to receive the Lord's Vibrations (the first step is receiving, being able to receive them; afterwards you have to hold on to and then manifest them). Those vibrations are <em>unmistakable</em>, they are something else entirely. But other vibrations are helpful, beneficial, while still others are disruptive, contradictory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1993">And each one is beginning to reveal its own particular nature. There are those stemming from people's thoughts (I sense them in my body, not in the mind: the material consequence of people's psychological state, and even their state of health). Some things are general and last a bit longer; others are momentary, lasting only a few seconds. The first step is to study the different vibrational qualities ‚Äì you could practically draw diagrams: if we had a machine sensitive enough to record these things, it would produce all kinds of zigs and zags.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="160" href="#">2</a> Certain vibrations immediately stop or change or are dissolved or repelled. Others are adopted, as it were, and transformed. The majority are simply pushed back and worked on from a distance ‚Äì quite a distance! I keep them at a fair distance <em>(Mother laughs)</em>. Very few are let in. But some are let in for the sake of the experience, to see how much they upset the body. There's also the effect of people's permanent auras: I know a certain person is arriving by his aura's effect on the body; because <em>(laughing)</em> each vibration has its particular effect on the body ‚Äì perfectly prosaic things, maybe, but by studying them you realize that each thing has its own law.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1994">The interchange of vibrations among people is something tremendous, and we're swimming in it all, all, all the time ‚Äì even when we're alone! Because these things travel: for instance, it's enough for someone's thought to come and strike against yours, and for you to think of him (which means responding) ‚Äì there is</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 299</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-1995">The only possible solution is so perfect a union with the supreme Vibration that everything is automatically put under His influence; and in that case it is easier to feel wider, higher, vaster than the world (to take just the earth: the terrestrial world) than an individual.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="161" href="#">3</a> For it is easier to do this <em>(embracing gesture)</em>, to take everything in, to embrace and change it from outside, than to change it from inside.

All these vibrations come, pass through, whirl around, they come from everywhere, but here <em>(the head)</em> nothing moves, there's no response.

One of them, the strongest, is my translation of <em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>.

And I see that there's an immense field of intellectual thought, intellectual formulation, with varying degrees of intensity and precision, serving as a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SIEVE</span> for the Supreme's Will to pass through. And the sieve ‚Äì this sort of immense universal sieve ‚Äì is what gives the precision.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="166" href="#">8</a> It's very interesting.

<p class="Q"> (long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2017">I am making some interesting discoveries. They aren't really discoveries, but nowadays none of these things are theoretical, not the least bit mental (the mind is in a quiet ease) ‚Äì they're essentially practical. And they take unexpected forms.... The other day as I was walking, an old formation suddenly popped up, some. thing that had already tried to materialize when Sri Aurobindo was still here, but which he had stopped. It was one possibility among innumerable others, trying to manifest in this body's existence ‚Äì I won't say what it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2018">It was one of the very saddest things that could manifest physically in association with a spiritual life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2019">It came and tried to descend. I said absolutely 
nothing, but Sri Aurobindo knew (though he never mentioned anything to me, he 
had seen it), and he simply... <em>(sweeping gesture)</em> did what had to be done, <em>brushed it aside</em>. I hadn't thought about it for more than ten years: with that gesture of his, it had vanished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2020">Now it has come back.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2021">‚ÄúWell, well ‚Äì why has that returned?‚Äù I wondered. And then I saw that this body has been built in such a way that it instinctively <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ATTRACTS</span> <em>ordeals</em>, painful experiences. And in the face of such formations, it is always passive, consenting, accepting, and totally confident in the ultimate outcome, with such an ingrained certitude that even at the moment of greatest difficulty, it will be helped and saved, and that the purpose behind all those ordeals is to speed up, to gain time, and to exhaust all the... I can't say the evil possibilities, but all the hindrances ‚Äì things that hamper, block the way and seem to negate the goal ‚Äì so that they are pushed back into the past and no longer hinder progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2022">Once I saw that, the formation went away. It had come just to show me that. And once again the body gave its eternal assent: no matter what it's burdened with, it will always be ready to receive and to bear it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2023">I never thought this would have any consequences, but it did!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="167" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 303</p>
<p class="PE"> Something probably needed to be exhausted. So physically speaking, yesterday was a pretty bad day ‚Äì oh, only quite externally! In fact, the body was luminously conscious, profoundly happy and joyous, to the point where all suffering becomes negligible ‚Äì you don't notice it. And so it was a real opportunity for the whole entourage to make progress. That helps.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2024">Superficially, it <span class="note_0">[the body's characteristic of attracting ordeals]</span> could be called a sort of karma, but that's not what it is. It's actually like one of the pivots ‚Äì not a central one, but one of the pivots of the body's invisible action, of its consciousness. And it is expressed by attracting certain circumstances. A whole range of things having to do with the physical body has thus become very clear and precise to me ‚Äì and that's what the body was made for: to go full speed ahead.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2025">Intellectually, I don't at all believe in taking others' misfortunes upon oneself ‚Äì that's childish. But certain vibrations in the world must be accepted, exhausted and transformed. Inwardly, that's the work I have been doing all my life ‚Äì consciously, gloriously. But now it's on a purely physical level, independent of all the realities of other worlds: it's in the body, you see. And this has given me a key, one of the necessary keys to the Work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2026">Maybe there will be something else another time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2027">It has been very revealing, like a door that has opened.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2028">And there's always that same Solicitude dosing the experience out ‚Äì that's always here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2029">And I have noticed that now.... You see, the body used to be like a little child, complaining when things weren't right; it wouldn't revolt, but it moaned. But this time its only reaction was, ‚ÄúWhy am I not transformed? Why am I not transformed? I want to be transformed, I want to be transformed....‚Äù Not with words, because there was nothing mental about it, but simply with a kind of tension ‚Äì the tension you feel when the door to the psychic being is shut and you push, push, push to get to the other side. The same thing, the same kind of tension: pushing, pushing, pushing... towards what? I don't know. We call it ‚Äúthe transformation‚Äù because we don't know what it is ‚Äì if we did know, it would mean we had already begun to realize it.... There's a faint impression of what that state could be (but it's very, very faint). And there's this feeling of tension, of pushing ‚Äì pleading and imploring. That was the body's only reaction this time, nothing else, not even any sorrow. Because at one time ‚Äì something like fifty years ago ‚Äì it used to say, ‚ÄúWhy do I deserve this?‚Äù and similar stupidities;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 304</p>
<p class="PE"> that's been gone for more than fifty years. Then for a long while after, something disordered, unharmonious or nasty could bring me sorrow; that's gone too. But that's recent, it disappeared with the experience of April 13. And now: transformation, transformation, transformation; that's the only idea left, the only will.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2030">For several days before that incident, something else had been coming, a kind of imaginative and creative vision of the most material physical possibilities for the future.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2031">I've had this great formative power ever since my earliest childhood, but I had channeled it and stopped it because I considered it useless. But it came back recently, along with the sure sign that it was coming from the very highest origin: ‚ÄúThis is it, this is how things will be.‚Äù But that's for later, of course. To our external reason, those things seem totally unrealizable, but they will be realizable in... perhaps a few hundred years, I don't know ‚Äì it's the future being prepared. And indeed, that vision has a tremendous power of creation and realization, and it is always felt physically (the rest is very still), it's always physical. But it triggered a kind of very rapid movement of the physical consciousness (within the most material substance), and caused a dislocation. And so<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="168" href="#">2</a> the day before yesterday, that old formation suddenly returned and made me understand one aspect of the body's nature, the way the body is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTRUCTED</span> and the usefulness of that construction. So now things are all right. It has been one more step.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2032"><em>But when you receive those bad vibrations affecting your body,3are they exhausted by your accepting them?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2033">It's not that I ‚Äúreceive‚Äù bad vibrations, but that the physical substance is not entirely... (how can I explain?) in the proper</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 305</p>
<p class="PE"> movement or rhythm. For instance, between the vision of that old formation I spoke of and this... (I can't call it a toothache, but anyway, something went wrong) there was no visible connection to speak of. The toothache wasn't caused by a particular vibration, it's rather... as if one thing or another provided the opportunity for absorbing a certain quantity or type of vibration (it's more a quantity than a type ‚Äì probably both), a vibratory <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MODE</span>, in order to put it in contact with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> vibratory mode ‚Äì the divine one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2034">But I understand your question. You want to know if this has an effect on all identical vibratory modes in the world.... In principle, yes. But the effects may not be immediately visible; in the first place, our field of observation is nothing ‚Äì materially, what do we know?... Only our immediate surroundings ‚Äì that's nothing. In 1920, for example, I had an experience of that type, which resulted in a symbolic but terrestrial action. It was a vision (I don't remember enough details to make it interesting) where each nation was represented by a symbolic entity, and there was a certain type of horror ‚Äì of terror, rather. A certain ‚Äúwill of terror‚Äù was trying to manifest in that gathering of all nations. And I was witness to the whole thing. I remember it being a very conscious and rather long and detailed vision with a more intense reality than physical things have (it was in the subtle physical). And after it was over and I had done what needed to be done (I am not saying what because I don't remember all the details, and without accuracy it loses its value), when I came out of it I could say with <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TOTAL</span> conviction: ‚ÄúTerror has been overcome in the world.‚Äù Of course, it's not literally true, plenty of people still feel terror, but a certain type of terror was as if <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNDERMINED</span> at the foundations. What had already manifested kept on and is gradually being exhausted, but the terror that was trying to increase and dominate the life of nations was stopped cold.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2035">I have had other similar experiences ‚Äì on Durga's day, for instance, when Sri Aurobindo was still here (you know, that's the day when Durga masters an asura; she doesn't kill him, she masters him). Well, each year one particular type of thing was undermined (and my experiences were never mental: the experience would suddenly come, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AFTERWARDS</span> I would realize it was Durga's day), and each time I used to tell Sri Aurobindo, ‚ÄúLook ‚Äì today this (or that) thing has been cut off at the roots.‚Äù That's how it works with the adverse forces ‚Äì yes, like something being uprooted from the world. Whatever has already spread out keeps going and follows its karma, but the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SOURCE</span> is dried up. That's</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 306</p>
<p class="PE"> also what happened (it was in 1904, I believe) when the Asura of Consciousness and Darkness made his surrender and was converted; he told me, ‚ÄúI have millions and millions of emanations, and these will keep on living, but their source has now run dry.‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="170" href="#">4</a> How much time will it take to exhaust it all?... We can't say, but the source has dried up and that is something extremely important. In 1920, that terror was trying to spread all over the world and to become really catastrophic; and then in my inner vision I could see that a whole movement had dried up at its source. This means that little by little, little by little, little by little... the karma is being exhausted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2036">The same goes for these little physical movements. Things don't seem to be ‚Äúinitiated‚Äù any more, I mean they're no longer being generated. But everything that's already present in the world has to be exhausted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2037">I can see more rapid methods, but they are essentially part of the supramental world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2038">To change a karma, to stop a karma, to withdraw a certain number of vibrations from circulation, as it were, requires yet another movement, another movement altogether ‚Äì and that Power isn't yet at hand. That's what will yield visible, tangible results. The other movement has very tangible and concrete results, but they're invisible (to human observation, that is, which is much too limited and superficial). But it obviously does have results. That vision of terror clearly diverted the course of events that nations were being pushed into. But only someone with inner vision can see it.</p>

(same radiating gesture)</em> ‚Äì these same vibrations are everywhere, in all bodies and all things. What people call this body is merely the result of a willed concentration organized in a specific way; that's how it spontaneously feels, all the time (not that it's observing itself, but if something forces it to observe itself, that's what it spontaneously feels). And the delimitation that exists in all beings, and which <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WAS</span> in this body (was it this body?... Haven't the cells changed?...

<p class="Ps"><em>(It is extremely unfortunate that the beginning of this conversation, which would have thrown a clear light on what follows, was not kept. As far as Satprem remembers, the subject was his sleep. It seems Mother was saying that while his ‚Äústrolls by the sea‚Äù took place during sleep and by passing into another state, for her ‚Äì and this is where the notes begin ‚Äì there was no more ‚Äúsleep‚Äù and no more ‚Äúpassing‚Äù into another state, from the ordinary physical to the subtle physical, because everything seemed to have become or was becoming one and the same continuous Matter. The true Matter, probably.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2146">That's one thing that's happening. The two <span class="note_0">[the ordinary physical and the subtle physical]</span> seem to be fusing more and more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2147">I have already explained this to you on several occasions: instead of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SHIFTING</span> from one to the other, it's as if one were permeated by the other, like this <em>(Mother slips the fingers of her right hand in between the fingers of her left hand)</em>, and you can almost feel both simultaneously. It's one of the results of what's going on these days. A very slight concentration, for example, is all it takes to feel both at the same time, which leads me to a near conviction that true change in the physical results from a kind of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PENETRATION</span>. The most material physical substance no longer has that unreceptive sort of density, a density that resists penetration: it is becoming porous, and thus can be penetrated. Several times, in fact, I've had the experience of one vibration quite naturally changing the quality of the other ‚Äì the subtle physical vibration was bringing about a sort of... almost a transformation, or in any case a noticeable change in the purely physical vibration.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 321</p>
<p class="PE"> That seems to be the process, or at least one of the most important processes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2148">And it's growing more and more prominent. I spend almost every night in that realm; and even during the day, as soon as the body is motionless, there's this perception of the two vibrations, and of the physical vibration almost becoming porous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2149">It seems to be the process, or certainly one important process, for the physical transformation.</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2150">You see, the subtle physical seems to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DOSE OUT</span> its power and light and capacity of consciousness according to the amount of receptivity in the purely physical vibration. That's why the effects stretch over a long period of time. It's being done very, very gradually. But it's an almost continuous work. Only when there's some bodily activity and the consciousness must turn outwards (not in the same way as before, that's impossible, but still in a way that seems like a continuation of the old consciousness), then, if the work continues at all, it's invisible ‚Äì and maybe it doesn't continue.... I don't know. But as soon as all activity stops and the body is concentrated or immobile ‚Äì perhaps no more than simply passive ‚Äì that penetration is perceptible: it's visible. Visible. And it's not like something more subtle penetrating something less subtle without altering it; the essential point is that this penetration actually changes the composition. It's not merely a degree of subtlety, it's a change in the internal composition. Ultimately, this action probably has an effect on the atomic level. And that's how the practical possibility of transformation can be accounted for.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2151">It's an experience I have all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2152">At times it's a bit new or a bit extreme, and you have to be careful the body doesn't panic. But then you see how everything is dosed out and maintained in a way that... <em>(Mother laughs)</em> nothing falls to pieces!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2153">On the surface, it's a very humble work, nothing sensational. There are no illuminations filling you with joy and.... All that is fine for people seeking spiritual joys ‚Äì it belongs to the past.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2154">It's a very modest work, very modest, even from a purely intellectual vantage point. It's different from the sensation of knowing things because you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ARE</span> them, which gives you joy, a sense of progress. It's not even like that! It is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> humble, a very humble and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 322</p>
<p class="PE"> unglamorous work, but which keeps on very regularly, with extreme regularity and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">STUBBORNNESS</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2155">It will surely stretch over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2156">And at each step, it's as though you had to take great care that nothing gets thrown off balance. The new combinations of vibrations, especially, are difficult for the body ‚Äì it must be very, very quiet, well under control, very peaceful, or else it panics. Because it's used to vibrations whose effects follow a regular pattern, so if the pattern changes there's a kind of frightened jolt. That must be avoided, the body has to be very gently kept under control.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2157">What the mind thinks, what it expects to see, looks so childish in comparison, like... yes, like theatrics, really. It's the difference between some grand extravaganza and the very modest life of each minute. Exactly that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2158">All the powers, all the <em>siddhis</em>, all the realizations, all these things are... the grand extravaganza ‚Äì the great spiritual spectacle. But this isn't like that. It's very modest, very modest, very unobtrusive, very humble, nothing showy about it. It takes years and years and years of silent, quiet and extremely careful work before there can be any visible and tangible results, before anything can be noticed, even for the <span class="note_0">[Mother's]</span> individual consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2159">As for those who want to go quickly, if they try going quickly in this realm, they'll be thrown off balance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2160">You can't go quickly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2161">Once, when I saw how it was, I complained a bit to the Lord: ‚ÄúLord, why did you make the body this way for doing this kind of work? Just look at it!‚Äù He answered me <em>(laughing)</em>, ‚ÄúIt's the best that could be done.‚Äù So I said ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù and kept quiet.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2162">And that's probably true! It has some good points: what they call <em>stubborn</em> in English ‚Äì you know <em>(Mother plants down her two fists and holds them motionless)</em>. And <em>stubbornness</em> is an essentially British quality, so there's no other word for it. The body is <em>stubborn</em>; and that's what is needed.</p>

For how many... oh, you could practically say centuries will it be like this before the glorious body of a supramental being appears?... Something came yesterday evening (it seemed like mere excitation to me); it was a power of creative imagination attempting to visualize supramental forms, beings that live in other worlds, and all sorts of things like that. I saw many things. But it seemed so... like champagne bubbles! ‚ÄúThat's all very nice,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúfor widening my power of imagination so I can present these forms to the Lord.... But it's not necessary!‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> It really seemed so.... There was a time when I considered it a great creative power (and many things that I saw in those moments of super-creativity, super-imagination, were actually realized years later on earth), and this time it came again (perhaps to give me a little fun, a little spectacle along the way), it came and I looked at it; I could see all its power, I could see it was something trying to materialize in the future, and I said, ‚ÄúWhat histrionics! Why go through all these theatrics?...‚Äù Jugglers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2178">And it was supramental light, it originated in supramental light. How beings from other worlds would relate with the future beings, and all sorts of similar things ‚Äì bedtime stories.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2179">But the vibration was there, you see, high above and all around the earth, very powerful (it was all around the earth) and very strong, it seemed to be coming from other parts of the universe and trying to enter the earth's atmosphere to help it participate in those new combinations. And it all seemed like childishness to me ‚Äì the whole universe seemed to be living in childishness. There was something so tranquil here ‚Äì so tranquil, so calm and unhurried, not interested in showing anything off, but capable of living in an eternity of quiet effort and progress.

You, You are the worker; You are here and You alone exist. You are the realizer.‚Äù Then all grew silent, still, motionless ‚Äì and the excitement waned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2180">So you see, there's excitement in the universe too, if you're not careful!

And (to be perfectly explicit) I have a feeling that to have access to the highest and purest Power, the very notion of ‚Äúresult‚Äù must disappear completely ‚Äì the Supreme Power has no sense of result <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT ALL</span>. The sense of result is yet another rift between the essential, supreme Power, and the consciousness. In other words, it's because the consciousness begins to separate slightly <span class="note_0">[from its identity with the Supreme Power]</span>, that the sense of result is created, but otherwise it doesn't exist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2184">It's as if everything had to be... to be the Action, the eternal Action at each second of the Manifestation ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> thing.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2185">Uninterrupted, with one link ‚Äì the link of supreme Eternity. But the sense of consequences is false, it already implies a lowering of consciousness.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2186">It's a kind of liberation ‚Äì I don't mean from worry or preoccupation, there's no question of that ‚Äì but from the very <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IDEA</span> of a consequence: it's this way</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 326</p>
<p class="PE"> because that's the way it is; it has to be this way, so it is. That's all. And at each second it's this way because it has to be, and so it is. And That repeats itself eternally, and it is this eternal Pulsation which is expressed in time by those gusts ‚Äì I feel this very strongly, very strongly. It's a constant, spontaneous and very natural experience for me. The idea of something behind or ahead in time and so on is... a Truth changing from immutable Eternity into Eternity of manifestation. And it changes like this <em>(Mother makes a pulsating gesture)</em>, exactly like gusts ‚Äì puff, puff, puff....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2187">Irresponsible gusts, like a child's soap bubbles, you might say. No sense of consequences ‚Äì none, none whatsoever: puff, puff, puff... like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2188">It's an ever-present experience for me.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2212"><em>‚ÄúI was lying on my chaise longue in concentration when all at once I found myself in my friend Z's house. He and several others were playing music. I could see everything very clearly, even more clearly than in the physical, and I moved around very quickly, unimpeded. I stayed there watching for a while, and even tried to attract their attention, but they were unaware of me. Then suddenly something pulled me, a sort of instinct: 'I must go back.' I felt pain in my throat. I remember that to get out of their room, which was all closed except for one small opening high up, my form seemed to vaporize (because I still had a form, though unlike our material one ‚Äì more luminous, less opaque), and I went out like smoke through the open window. Then I found myself back in my room, next to my body, and I saw that my head was twisted and rigid against the cushion, and I was having trouble breathing. I wanted to get into my body: impossible. So I became afraid. I entered through the legs, and when I reached the knees I seemed to bounce back out; two, three times like that: the consciousness rose and then bounced back out like a spring. 'If I could only tip over this stool,' I thought (there was a small stool under my feet), 'the noise would wake me up!' But nothing doing. And I was breathing more and more heavily. I was terribly afraid. Suddenly I remembered Mother and cried out, 'Mother! Mother!' and found myself back in my body, awake, with a stiff neck.‚Äù</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2259">I never had an experience for the joy of it ‚Äì never. They came only when it was necessary. Nothing ever happened in my life that wasn't absolutely indispensable for my work. But to know this, you understand, you must know exactly what your work is and be conscious of the divine Will; and many years may go by before you reach that point.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2260">I remember that one of the first things I asked Sri Aurobindo when I came here, after innumerable experiences and innumerable realizations, was, ‚ÄúWhy am I so mediocre?... Everything I do is mediocre, all my realizations are mediocre, there's never anything remarkable or exceptional ‚Äì it's just average. It isn't low, but it's not high either ‚Äì everything is average.‚Äù And that's really how I felt. I painted: it wasn't bad painting, but many others could do as well. I played music: it wasn't bad music, but you couldn't say, ‚ÄúOh, what a musical genius!‚Äù I wrote: it was perfectly ordinary. My thoughts slightly excelled those of my friends, but nothing exceptional; I had no special gift for philosophy or whatever. Everything I did was like that: my body had its skills, but nothing fantastic; I wasn't ugly, I wasn't beautiful... you see, everything was mediocre, mediocre, mediocre, mediocre. Then he told me, ‚ÄúIt was indispensable.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2261">All right, so I kept quiet ‚Äì and very quickly, within a few weeks, I understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2262">But I had that feeling throughout my childhood. I was a good student, but no genius.... And so on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2263"><em>Ever since I was very young, I have always thirsted for the same thing: I have always wanted to be conscious. So what makes me furious is that I am not conscious ‚Äì it infuriates me.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2264">For a long, long time, that was also the one thing I felt was worth living for ‚Äì Consciousness. When I met Th√©on and came to understand the mechanism, I also understood why I wasn't conscious at a certain level. I think I've told you how I spent ten months one year working to connect two layers ‚Äì two layers of consciousness; the contact wasn't established and so I couldn't have the spontaneous</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 336</p>
<p class="PE"> experience of a whole spectrum of things. Madame Th√©on told me, ‚ÄúIt's because there's an undeveloped layer between this part and that part.‚Äù I was very conscious of all the gradations: Th√©on had explained it all in the simplest terms, so you didn't need to be, as I said, a genius to understand. He had made a quadruple division, and each of them was divided into four, and then again into four, making innumerable divisions of the being; but with that mental simplification you could make in-depth psychological studies of your own being. And so by observation and elimination I eventually discovered that between this and that <em>(gesture indicating two levels of Mother's consciousness)</em>, there was an undeveloped layer ‚Äì it wasn't conscious. So I worked for ten months on nothing but that: absolutely no results. I didn't care, I kept right on, telling myself, ‚ÄúWell, it may take me fifty years to get anywhere, who knows.‚Äù And then I left for the country (I was living in Paris at the time). I lay down on the grass, and all at once, with the contact of earth and grass, poof! There was a sort of inner explosion ‚Äì the link was established, and full consciousness came, along with all the ensuing experiences. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I said to myself, ‚Äúit was worth all the trouble!‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2265">And I am sure that's how the work is done, slowly, imperceptibly, like a chick being formed in the egg: you see the shell, you see only the shell, you don't know what's inside, whether it's just an egg or a chick (normally, I mean ‚Äì of course, you could see through with special instruments) and then the beak goes peck-peck! And then cheep! Out comes the chick, just like that. It's the same thing exactly for the contact with the psychic being. For months on end, sometimes years, you may be sitting before a closed door, push, push, pushing, and feeling, feeling the pressure (it hurts!), and there's nothing, no results. Then all at once, you don't know why or how, you sit down and poof! Everything bursts wide open, everything is ready, everything is done ‚Äì it's over, you emerge into a full psychic consciousness and become intimate with your psychic being. Then everything changes ‚Äì everything changes ‚Äì your life completely changes, it's a total reversal of your whole existence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2266">In the end, it's best not to worry, not to get agitated or depressed (that's the worst of all), not to get worked up or impatient or disgusted ‚Äì just be calm and say, ‚ÄúIt will come when it comes,‚Äù but with an unyielding stubbornness. Do what you feel has to be done, and keep on with it, keep on even if it seems utterly futile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2267"><em>But if I only had a method!</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 337</p>
<p class="PE"> There are methods ‚Äì books are full of them. I don't recommend any of them: it's always the method the author uses or has heard of. Everyone has to find his own method.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2268">One can get certain hints, one can find one's own method.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2269">But one has to.... Look, it's the same as for japa. Your japa is given to you, isn't it? You receive it (unless you find it on your own, but that's harder and already requires another level of realization); you receive your japa along with the power to do it ‚Äì but you have to learn how to do it, right? For a long while you don't fully succeed; all sorts of things happen ‚Äì you forget it right in the middle or fall asleep or grow tired, get a headache, all sorts of things; or even outer circumstances interfere and disturb you. Well, here it's the same: you tell yourself, ‚ÄúI'll do it,‚Äù and you will do it, even if.... You have to go at it just like a mule: everything blocks the way but you keep going. You said you'd do it and you will do it. There are no results ‚Äì I don't care. Everything is against me ‚Äì I don't care. I said I'd do it and I will... I said I'd do it and I will. And you keep on going like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2270">It's the same thing in your case. It depends on what you want to achieve. Simply what I told you about sleep or resting, for example, ought to be enough. On that, you base your own discipline ‚Äì or on words that were uttered, or gestures that were made, or ideas you've received. You establish your own discipline. And once you have chosen your discipline, you keep on with it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2271">That's my experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2272">Stubbornly. You have to be stubborn ‚Äì stubborn, stubborn, stubborn. You're up against all the resistance of unconsciousness and ignorance, up against all the power of unconsciousness and ignorance ‚Äì something obstinate and unyielding. But it's like the story of the drop of water on the rock: a matter of time. The water will eventually wear its way through the rock. It takes ages, but it will succeed, for it falls persistently, drop after drop. First it runs off, eventually it makes a hole, and you have a wide river flowing below. Nature gives us this wonderful example to follow. That's it: we must be like the water dripping on the rock.</p>

<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2289">It's a strange sensation, a bizarre perception of both the true functioning and the functioning distorted by the sense of being an individual body. They're not even... you can't even say they're superimposed, they're almost simultaneous, and that's why it is so hard to explain.... A number of things are malfunctioning in the body; I don't know if they can be called illnesses (maybe the doctors would call them illnesses...), but in any case, they're malfunctionings in the body's organs: the heart, the stomach, the intestines, the lungs and so on. And at the same time there's (it can't be called a ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù) the true state. And thus certain disorders appear only when the consciousness... as if the consciousness were pulled or pushed or poised in a certain way,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 340</p>
<p class="PE"> and then, those malfunctionings <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">INSTANTLY</span> appear ‚Äì not as a consequence: I mean the consciousness becomes aware of their existence. And if the consciousness stays in that position long enough, there are what we conventionally call consequences: the malfunctioning has its consequences (tiny things, such as physical discomforts, for instance). And if through (is it yogic discipline, is it the Lord's intervention?... Call it what you will)... but if the consciousness regains its true position, the consequences cease <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IMMEDIATELY</span>. Sometimes, though, it's like this <em>(Mother makes a gesture of an overlapping or interpenetration by interlacing the fingers of her two hands)</em>, in other words, this way, then that, this way, then that <em>(Mother slips the fingers of her right hand back and forth through the fingers of her left to show the consciousness alternating between two states)</em>, this position, then that position, this one, then that one. This movement takes only a few seconds, so I can almost perceive the two functionings simultaneously. That's what gave me the knowledge of the process, otherwise I wouldn't understand; I would simply think I am falling from one state into another. That's not it, it's just.... The substance, the vibrations, everything is probably following its normal course, you see, and all that is really changing is the way consciousness perceives things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2290">So pushing this knowledge to its limit ‚Äì that is, applying it generally ‚Äì life (what we usually call ‚Äúlife,‚Äù the physical life of the body) and death are <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE SAME THING</span>, simultaneous... it's just that the consciousness moves back and forth, back and forth <em>(same gesture)</em>. I don't know if I am making myself clear. But it's fantastic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2291">And this experience comes with examples just as concrete and as utterly banal as can be. There's no room for imagination or enthusiasm ‚Äì they are details of the utmost banality. For example (it's only <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> example), this sudden shift of consciousness takes place (something imperceptible, you can't perceive it, for if you had time to perceive it, I suppose it wouldn't happen; it isn't objectified), and... you feel you're going to faint, all the blood rushes from the head to the feet and: whoops! But if the consciousness is caught <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN TIME</span>, it doesn't happen; and if it's not caught in time, it does.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2292">This would tend to show.... I don't know if we can generalize or if this is just one special case being worked out (I can't say), but there's a very distinct impression that what ordinary human consciousness perceives as death might simply be that the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 341</p>
<p class="PE"> consciousness hasn't been brought back to its true position fast enough.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2293">I am quite aware that all this must seem confusing; I can feel how inadequate the words and expression are for describing the experience. When you want to be literary, you say it's a ‚Äúreversal of consciousness‚Äù ‚Äì but it isn't! That's just literature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2294">Although perhaps it means we are drawing closer to the knowledge of the thing ‚Äì by knowledge I mean the power to change it, of course. If you have power over something, it's because you know it; ‚Äúknowing‚Äù a thing means being able to create it, or change it, to make it last or cease to be ‚Äì in other words it is Power. That's what ‚Äúknowing‚Äù means. All the rest is explanations the mind gives to itself. And I can feel that something (‚Äúsomething‚Äù! Well, what Sri Aurobindo calls ‚Äúthe Lord of Yoga‚Äù: the part of the Supreme concerned with terrestrial evolution) is leading me towards the discovery of that Power ‚Äì that Knowledge ‚Äì naturally by the only possible means: experience.

One fact in particular is bewildering to ordinary vision: I am very, very regularly losing weight. It's already down to a ridiculous figure ‚Äì I weigh only 85 pounds! With my height and bone structure, my normal weight should be 130 pounds; when I was twenty-five I weighed 130 or 135. Now I am down to only 85, and it's going down quite regularly. I understand how disturbing this might be for people who see things in the ordinary way!... I don't eat much (not a little, not a lot, just average), and I don't seem to benefit from what I eat ‚Äì that's how it looks on the surface. And then there are these strange phenomena; I don't usually talk about them (you're the only one I have explained them to, nobody else), I don't talk about them, but from time to time I appear to... I must appear to be fainting. And not in the usual way, you know, that's the thing! Nothing happens in the usual way, so it's very upsetting! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> The Energy is tremendous, more tremendous than it has ever been; and there is practically no physical strength.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2335">I don't want English. I don't want English! And more and more, I don't want English. For instance, the English translation of <em>Prayers and Meditations</em> is out of print and they wanted to reprint it. I said no: ‚ÄúIf you want, you can reprint what Sri Aurobindo <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HIMSELF</span> translated (there's not much, just a thin volume).

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2336"><em>Prayers and Meditations</em> came to me, you know ‚Äì it was dictated each time. I would write at the end of my concentration, and it didn't pass through the mind, it just came ‚Äì and it obviously came from someone interested in beautiful form. I used to keep it under lock and key so nobody would see it. But when I came here Sri Aurobindo asked about it, so I showed him a few pages and then he wanted to see the rest. Otherwise I would have always kept it locked away. I destroyed whatever was left ‚Äì there were five thick volumes in which I had written every single day (there was some repetition, of course): the outcome of my concentrations. So I chose which parts would be published (Sri Aurobindo helped in the choice), copied them out, and then I cut the pages up and had the rest burned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2337"><em>That's a shame!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2338">There are a few original fragments left from what was published ‚Äì I distributed almost all of them; the ink has faded, it's practically white. I burned everything.</p>

Of course, this is a childlike way of putting it, but it's comprehensible. So all</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 353</p>
<p class="PE"> these gods work in harmony and order. That's what the ancient tradition says.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2386">As far as I've understood, the Indian tradition has embraced everything that came from the first Emanations, since all the gods of destruction, of unconsciousness and of suffering are included in its pantheon.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2387">In the end, I think it's up to each one to name what he wants the way he wants. That's how I have always felt. Even in Hindu tradition it is written: ‚ÄúMan is chattel for the gods; beware of the gods.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2388">All this is merely a question of language to me ‚Äì words to suit each one according to his nature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2389">I've had conscious contacts with all the beings of the tradition Th√©on made known to me, and with all the beings described in Indian tradition; in fact, as far as I know I've had contacts with all the deities of all the religions. There's a gradation <em>(gesture of levels)</em>. These beings are found all the way from... there are even some in the vital; in the mental realm, man has deified many things: he has readily made gods out of whatever didn't seem exactly like him. If you are eclectic, you can have contacts with them all. And they all have their own reality and existence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2390">This region just overlooks the earth and the mind (including the very highest mind). But evolution ‚Äì I mean <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TERRESTRIAL</span> evolution, with its particular rhythm which is more condensed, more concentrated and, you could say, more focused than universal evolution as a whole ‚Äì this terrestrial evolution has, with the human species, created a kind of higher intellectuality capable of passing through the overmental region, the region of the gods, and reaching a higher Principle directly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2391">But this overmental region, this region of the gods with the power to govern the universe and, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PARTIALLY</span>, the earth, does have its own reality. You can come into contact with it and use it; the Vedic ‚Äúforefathers‚Äù used it, occultists use it, even Tantrics use it. But there's another path which, distrusting the gods, bypasses them through a kind of intellectual asceticism, as it were, wary of forms, of images, and differing expressions, which rises straight as an arrow, proud and pure, towards the supramental Light. That is a living experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2392">Sri Aurobindo preached the integral yoga which includes everything, so one can have all the experiences. Indeed, the universe was clearly created as a field of experience. Some people prefer the short, straight and narrow paths ‚Äì that's their business. Others like to dawdle along the way ‚Äì and that's their business!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 354</p>
<p class="PE"> And some are drawn to have all the experiences, and thus they often wander for a long time through the overmental world. And of course, the vast majority of those who have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">RELIGIOUS</span> aspirations are thus put in touch with various deities, where they stop ‚Äì it's enough for them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2393">But everything I've just said is only one tiny part of the whole story.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2394">Actually, this domain of the gods belongs to our side, although on a godlike scale: with the gods' power, their possibilities, their consciousness, their freedom; and their immortality, too. In other words, a godlike life ‚Äì I think most human beings would be more than satisfied with it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2395">And as all the stories tell us, sometimes the gods come to earth to have some fun. I know that some come and take on a human body to have a psychic being ‚Äì but not all. Most of them simply enjoy having human contact. In any case, they have bodies in their own domain ‚Äì there's no sense of being bodiless. They have bodies ‚Äì immortal ones.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2396"><em>Yes, but in the Supermind as well?...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2397">But the gods don't go to the Supermind!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2398"><em>No, what I mainly want to know is the difference when you cross to the other side, into the Supermind ‚Äì the difference in vision between the Supermind and the overmind.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2399">I don't know what Sri Aurobindo would tell you....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2400">This is just what I am observing these days. To me, the overmental consciousness is a magnified consciousness: far lovelier, far loftier, far more powerful, far happier, far... with lots of ‚Äúfar more's‚Äù to it. But.... I can tell you one thing: the gods don't have the sense of Oneness. For instance, in their own way they quarrel among themselves, which shows they have no sense of Oneness, no sense of all being one, of all being various expressions of the Divine ‚Äì the unique Divine. So they are still on this side, but with magnified forms, and powers beyond our comprehension: the power to change form at will, for example, or to be in many places at the same time ‚Äì all sorts of things that poor human beings can only dream of having. The gods have it all. They live a divine life! But it's not supramental.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2401">The Supermind is knowledge ‚Äì Pure Knowledge. Yes, it is knowing ‚Äì knowing what is to be known.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 355</p>
<p class="PE"> There is no longer a play <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BETWEEN</span> oneself and things, it's.... Truly, the sign of the Supermind is Oneness. Not a sum of a lot of different things, but, on the contrary, a Oneness... at play with Itself. There's nothing of the way gods relate to each other and the world, for they are still part of the realm of diversity, though <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FREE</span> from Ignorance. They don't have Ignorance, they don't have what we human beings have here. They have no Ignorance, they have no Unconsciousness, but they have the sense of diversity and of separation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2402"><em>What about Sri Aurobindo's experience at Alipore, then? You know, that well-known experience when he saw Narayana in the prisoners, Narayana in the guards, Narayana everywhere?...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2403">That is the Supreme. Oneness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2404"><em>Is it a supramental experience or....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2405">It is supramental.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2406"><em>Supramental?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2407">Yes, the supramental experience. He called it Narayana because he was Indian.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2408"><em>It's supramental, not overmental?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2409">No, no.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2410">It's like the message of the Gita as Sri Aurobindo explained it: not overmental, but supramental. It is Oneness, the experience of Oneness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2411">The experience of the gods has never been more than a distraction for me ‚Äì an amusement, a pleasant diversion; none of it seems essential or indispensable. You can treat yourself to the luxury of all these experiences, and they increase your knowledge and your power, your this and your that, but it's not particularly important. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> thing is altogether different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2412">We can do without the gods. We can have access to the Supermind without any of these experiences, they're not indispensable. But if you want to know and experience the universe, if you want to be identified with the Supreme in His expression, well, all this is part of His expression, in varying degrees and with varying</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 356</p>
<p class="PE"> powers. It's all part of His experience. So why not treat yourself to that luxury? It's very interesting, very interesting ‚Äì but not indispensable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2413">I think that once you are identified with the Supreme and He has chosen you to do a work on earth, then He quite naturally grants you all these things, because it increases your power of action, that's all. That's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2414">As for me, there are no more problems, no more problems!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2415">This classification <span class="note_0">[of the planes of consciousness]</span> is very convenient and necessary at a given moment, especially when you are ascending and awakening; but afterwards....</p>
<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2416">Sri Aurobindo didn't put too much emphasis on the Overmind. The one significant point is that the Overmind has ruled the world through the different religions. And it is the dwelling place of all the gods, all the beings humans have made into gods in their religions. Those beings exist in their own world, and some humans, coming in touch with them, have been overwhelmed by their powers and their superiority, and have made gods and religions out of them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2417">But it's better not to emphasize this <span class="note_0">[in your book]</span>. As I have said, we can bypass that plane, or even pass through without knowing it. It interested me to read in the Vedas that if you don't ascend the way you're supposed to, if you try to bypass the gods, then unpleasant things happen to you and your way is blocked ‚Äì do you remember that?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="188" href="#">1</a> That gives you an idea of what it is. It's like an intermediary zone, far superior to the earth, but still intermediary. Some have tried to cross it without stopping; and there, they say, you run into trouble. Personally, I am not sure, I can only speak of my own experience: there was always a sense of fraternity ‚Äì as you can imagine! I knew them, I was on friendly terms with them, so there was no question of bypassing them or not!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2418">But I have a strong impression that that world is still a magnified version of our own, and part of the old path; it has nothing to do with the Supramental Creation, which will bring to earth the sense of the Supreme and the Unique.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 357</p>
<p class="PE"> Basically, it's part of the old path, a consequence of all that has happened, of the whole universal formation as we know it. People who believe in essential Evil would say it's a consequence of ‚Äúthe accident‚Äù of creation. But is it an accident? I have my doubts. It has yet to be revealed. And we won't know until... until it's over.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2419">I am speaking in riddles, but what else can I do!...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2442">78 ‚Äì When knowledge is fresh in us, then it is invincible; when it is old, it loses its virtue. This is because God moves always forward.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2443">So, what's your question?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2444"><em>The knowledge referred to here is intellectual or spiritual, but for the supramental yoga, knowledge is... what kind of knowledge is it? A knowledge in the body, a physical knowledge?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2445">Sri Aurobindo is speaking here of knowledge through inspiration or revelation. In other words, when something suddenly descends and illuminates your understanding: all of a sudden, you feel you know a certain thing for the very first time, because it comes to you directly from the domain of Light, the domain of true knowledge, and it comes with all its innate force of truth ‚Äì it illuminates you. And indeed, when you've just received it, it seems as though nothing could resist that Light. And if you make sure to let it work in you, it brings about as much transformation as it can in its own domain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2446">It is a fairly common experience. When it occurs, and for some time afterwards (not very long), everything seems to organize itself quite naturally around that Light. Then, little by little, it blends with all the rest. The intellectual awareness of it remains, formulated in one way or another ‚Äì that much is left ‚Äì but it's like an empty husk. It no longer has the driving force that transforms</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 364</p>
<p class="PE"> all movements of the being in the image of that Light. And this is what Sri Aurobindo means: the world moves fast, the Lord moves ever forward, and all that remains is but a trail He leaves in His wake: it no longer has the same instantaneous and almighty force it had at the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MOMENT</span> He projected it into the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2447">It's like a rain of truth falling, and anyone who can catch even a drop of it receives a revelation. But unless they themselves advance at a fantastic pace, the Lord and His rain of truth will already be far, far away, and they'll have to run very fast to catch up!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2448">This is an image I have always seen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2449">That's what he means.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2450"><em>Yes, but for this knowledge to really have a transformative power...?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2451">It is the higher Knowledge, Truth expressing itself, what he calls ‚Äúthe true knowledge‚Äù; and that knowledge transforms the whole creation. But He seems to let it rain down constantly, you see, and if you don't hurry up <em>(laughing)</em>, you get left behind!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2452">But have you never felt a sort of dazzling flash in your head? And then: ‚ÄúAha! That's it!‚Äù Sometimes it's something that was known intellectually, but it was drab and lifeless; and then all at once it comes as a tremendous power, organizing everything in the consciousness around that Light ‚Äì it doesn't last very long. Sometimes it lasts a few hours, sometimes a few days, but never longer, unless one is very slow in one's movement. And meanwhile, you know <em>(laughing)</em>, the Source of Truth is moving on and on and on....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2459">But any transformation in the being, on any plane, always has repercussions on the planes below. There is always an action. Even those things which seem purely intellectual certainly have an effect on the structure of the brain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2460">And these kinds of revelations happen only in a silent mind ‚Äì or at least a mind at rest. Unless the mind is absolutely tranquil and still, it doesn't come. Or if it does come, you don't even notice anything with all the racket you're making! And of course, these experiences help the tranquillity, the silence and receptivity to become better and better established. This sense of something utterly immobile, but not closed ‚Äì immobile, but open and receptive ‚Äì gets more established the more you have these experiences. There is a big difference between a dead, lackluster, unresponsive silence and the receptive silence of a quieted mind. It makes a big difference. And it results from these experiences. All the progress we make is always, quite naturally, the result of truths coming down from above.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2461">It has an effect: all these things have an effect on the way the body functions ‚Äì the workings of the organs, the brain, the nerves and so forth. And this will certainly take place long before there is any effect on the external form.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2462">Actually, when people speak of transformation, they're mainly thinking of a picturesque transformation, aren't they? A beautiful appearance ‚Äì luminous, supple, plastic, changing at will.... But they don't give much thought to this other thing, this rather... anesthetic transformation of the organs! And yet it's certainly what's going to happen first, long before the appearance is transformed.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2495"><em>What do you mean, you see through it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2496">Well, I mean I can see the luminous vibration behind it. But I realize that one way of seeing doesn't preclude the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2497">It's the same when I look at people: I don't see them as they see themselves, I see them with the vibration of all the forces that are in them and pass through them, and quite frequently with the supreme Vibration of the Presence. And that's why my physical sight is... not exactly failing, but changing in character, for the physical precision that normal physical sight gives is... it's false for me. Instinctively (not because I think of it that way), that's how it Is. So I no longer have the precision of a vision designed to see just the superficial crust of things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2498">But this doesn't keep me from seeing physically ‚Äì although, yes, it does at times make me unsure of who's in front of me, because I see a vibration that is sometimes very similar, almost identical, in three or four people (who aren't all necessarily present, but anyway...). So there's a slight external difference ‚Äì there's a very great external difference in the way the form looks, of course, but in the combination of vibrations there's only a slight external difference. And so sometimes I am not sure, I don't know whether it's this person or that one; that's why I often ask, ‚ÄúWho's there?‚Äù It's not that I don't see anything, but I don't see in the same way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2499">In a way, I think I see better. But in a particular way. If, for instance, I have to thread a needle (I have experimented with this kind of thing), well, if I try to thread the needle while looking at it, it's literally impossible. But sometimes (when I am in a certain attitude), if I have to thread a needle, it threads itself ‚Äì I have nothing to do with it: I hold the needle, I hold the thread, and that's that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2500">I think (in fact, it's quite simply a matter of experience), I think that if this state gets perfected one should be able to do everything in the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OTHER</span> way, the way that doesn't depend on external senses.

<p class="PE"> What shall we do? Do you have another aphorism?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2516">79 ‚Äì God is infinite Possibility. Therefore Truth is never at rest; therefore, also, Error is justified of her children.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2517">80 ‚Äì To listen to some devout people, one would imagine that God never laughs; Heine was nearer the mark when he found in Him the divine Aristophanes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2518">Yes, he means that what is true at one moment is no longer true at another. And that's what justifies the children of Error.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2519"><em>Perhaps he means there's no such thing as error!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2520">Yes, it's the same thing, another way of saying the same thing. In other words, what we call error was at one time truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2521">Error is a timebound notion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2522"><em>But there are things that really might seem like errors.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2523">Momentarily.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2524">That's exactly the impression: all our judgments are momentary. One moment one thing, the next moment something else. And errors exist for us because we see things in succession, one after the other; but that can't be how the Divine sees them, because everything is in Him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2525">Just try for a moment <em>(laughing)</em>, try and imagine you're the Divine! Everything is in you; you simply play at bringing it all out in a certain order. But for you, in your consciousness, it's all there simultaneously: there is no time, neither past, future, nor present ‚Äì it's all there together, every possible combination. He's just playing at bringing out one thing and then another; but the poor devils down below see only a small part of the whole (about as much as this) and say, ‚ÄúHere's an error!‚Äù How is it an error? Simply because what they see is only a small part.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2526">It's clear, isn't it? It's easy to understand. The notion of error belongs to time and space.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2527">The same goes for the feeling that a thing cannot both <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BE</span> and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT BE</span> at the same time. And yet that's the way things are:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 372</p>
<p class="PE"> something both is and is not at the same time. The notion of time, of time and space, is what brings in the notion of error.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2528"><em>What do you mean, something both is and is not at the same time?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2529">Something is, and simultaneously its opposite exists. Well, for us it can't be both yes and no at the same time; but for the Lord it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">CONSTANTLY</span> both yes and no at the same time!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2530">It's the same with our notion of space. ‚ÄúI am here,‚Äù we say, ‚Äútherefore you are not here.‚Äù But I am here and you are here and all is here! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> But you can't understand this unless you go beyond the notion of space and time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2531">It's something that can be very concretely sensed, if we stop seeing things the way we usually do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2532">Many of these aphorisms were surely written at a time when the higher mind suddenly surged into the Supermind. It hasn't yet forgotten how things look in the ordinary way, but it now sees how they are in the supramental way. And as a result, there's this kind of thing, that's what gives this paradoxical form.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2535">And we're the puppets, eh! That's why we take it so seriously. But as soon as we stop being puppets, we realize it's a comedy.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2537">Yes, because we make it tragic. <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WE</span> make it tragic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2538">I've been focusing on this lately. I've been looking at the difference between similar events in the lives of human beings and the lives of animals. If you identify with animals, you clearly see that they don't take things tragically at all ‚Äì except for those which have</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 373</p>
<p class="PE"> come into contact with man. (But then they're not in their natural state; it's a transitional state, they are beings in transition between animal and man.)

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2539">So many things, so many things.... Human beings have made an appalling tragedy out of death. And I saw, with all these recent experiences, I saw how many, many poor human beings have been destroyed by the very people they loved the most! Under the pretext that they were dead.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2540">People give them a very bad time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2541"><em>Destroyed?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2542">Yes, burned. Or shut up in a box without air and light ‚Äì while <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FULLY CONSCIOUS</span>. And just because they can no longer express themselves, people say they are ‚Äúdead.‚Äù They don't waste any time declaring them dead! But they are conscious. They are conscious. Imagine someone who can no longer speak or move ‚Äì according to human laws, he is ‚Äúdead.‚Äù He is dead but he is conscious. He is conscious, so he sees the people around him: some of them are weeping, some of them are... if he's a bit clairvoyant, he also sees that some of them are rejoicing. And then he sees himself put into a box, sees the lid nailed down, shutting him in: ‚ÄúAh, now it's all over, they're going to cover me with earth!‚Äù Or he's taken over there <span class="note_0">[to the cremation ground]</span>, and then it's fire in the mouth ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FULLY</span> conscious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2543">I have lived this in recent days. I have seen it. Last night or the night before, I spent at least two hours in a world ‚Äì the subtle physical world ‚Äì where the living mingle with the dead with no sense of difference, it makes absolutely no difference there. For instance, when Mridu<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="191" href="#">1</a> was in her body I used to see her at night maybe once a year (maybe not even that much). For years she was utterly nonexistent in my consciousness... but since she left her body, I see her almost every night! There she is, just as she was, you know <em>(rotund gesture)</em>, but no longer troubled, that's all. No longer troubled. And there were both living and... what we call the ‚Äúliving‚Äù and the ‚Äúdead‚Äù ‚Äì they were both there together, eating together, moving around together, having fun together; and</p>

<p class="PE"> all in a lovely, tranquil light ‚Äì pleasant, very pleasant. ‚ÄúThere!‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúand humans have drawn a sharp line, saying, 'Now he's dead!'‚Äù Dead! And what really takes the cake is the way they treat the body like an unconscious object, and it's still conscious!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2544">It's treated like an object: ‚ÄúNow then! Let's get rid of this just as quickly as we can: it's a nuisance and it gets in the way.‚Äù And even those who feel the most sorrow don't want to see it; it's too painful for them.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2545">Where, where is the Error? Where is the Error?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2546">In fact there's no such thing as error. There are only things that seem impossible because we don't know that the Lord is all possibility and can do whatever He wants, any way He wants. We just can't get it through our heads: ‚ÄúThis can be, but that can't,‚Äù we keep saying. But it's not true!

And then there are the actors, the poor actors, who don't even know their roles very well. They worry and fret because they're being made to play something and they don't know what it is. I've just had a very strong sense of this: we're all playing parts in the comedy, but we don't know what the comedy is, nor where it's going, where it's coming from, nor what it's all about. We just barely know (and poorly, at that) what we're supposed to do at a given moment. And knowing it so poorly, we worry about it. But when you know everything, you can't worry any more ‚Äì you smile. He must be having great fun, but for us.... And yet we are given the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FULL POWER</span> to have just as much fun as He does.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2553">This may be what the story of the earthly paradise is all about....

One is quite conscious of being powerless, utterly incompetent: more and more, I feel that this amalgam of matter, of cells and all the rest, is just pitiful! Pitiful. I don't know, under certain conditions people may feel powerful, wonderful, luminous, competent... but as far as I am concerned, that's because they have no idea what they're really like! When you really see what you're made of... it's nothing, really nothing. But it's capable of anything, provided... provided you let the Lord do it. The trouble is that something always wants to do things on its own. If it weren't like that....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2573">People come, letters arrive, various circumstances and problems arise (it's over now, but at the time ‚Äì even a year ago ‚Äì that kind of thing was sometimes a problem for me). Well, right</p>

<p class="PE"> away, I... <em>(Mother opens her hands in front of her forehead, palms upwards, as though presenting the problem to the Lord)</em>: ‚ÄúHere, Lord, look at this.‚Äù All I am good for is <em>(same gesture)</em>: ‚ÄúI am presenting it to You, Lord.‚Äù And then I keep still, I just keep still: ‚ÄúI won't move unless You move me, I won't speak unless You make me speak....‚Äù And then you stop thinking about it. You think about it just for a second, long enough to do this <em>(same gesture)</em>. It comes in like this, then up it goes <em>(gesture showing a problem coming to Mother from one side and being sent above)</em>. And later, you suddenly realize you're speaking or acting or making a decision or writing a letter or... and He has done it all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2574">But one can be full of excellent goodwill and still want to Do things. And that's what complicates everything. Or else there's a lack of faith, a lack of belief in the Lord's ability ‚Äì you think you have to do things yourself because He doesn't know how! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> This sort of stupidity is very widespread, you know: ‚ÄúHow can He see these things?

So the brain found itself in the presence of something <em>(laughing)</em> considerably more powerful than it was used to receiving! And, like the idiot it is, it got worried. As for me <em>(gesture above or beyond)</em>, I saw it all, I saw that the brain was getting worried, so I tried to tell it what a nitwit it was and to just keep still. It did keep still, but... you know, it was really seething away in there, as if it were about to explode. So I said, ‚ÄúAll right now, let's go see Sri Aurobindo and ask him what to do.‚Äù Immediately everything became utterly calm... and I woke up in Sri Aurobindo's house in the subtle physical ‚Äì a very material sensation, with everything</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 379</p>
<p class="PE"> quite concrete. So I arrived, or rather not I but the body-consciousness arrived<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="192" href="#">2</a> and started explaining to Sri Aurobindo what had happened ‚Äì it was very excited, talking and talking. The response was a sort of inscrutable smile and then... nothing. He simply looked. An inscrutable smile ‚Äì not a word. All the excitement died away. A face out of eternity. The excitement died away. Then it was time for Sri Aurobindo's lunch (people eat there ‚Äì in another way). So as not to disturb him, I went into the next room. He came in after some time and stood before me (I ‚Äì my physical being, that is, my physical consciousness ‚Äì had had time to calm down). I knelt down and took his hand (a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MUCH</span> clearer sensation than anything physical, mon petit!); I kissed his hand. He simply said, <em>‚ÄúOh!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2577">I am skipping all the details (it was a long thing, lasting an hour), but suddenly he went out of the room, leaving me alone (after expressing what he wanted to tell me with a gesture, which I understood). And then I simply seemed to take a step <em>(gesture of crossing a threshold)</em>, and I found myself lying in my bed again. And at that moment I said to myself, ‚ÄúReally! We make all kinds of complications, and it's so simple: you just have to go like this <em>(same gesture)</em> and there you are; then you go like that <em>(same gesture in the opposite direction)</em> and you're back here.‚Äù</p>

And it's merely this... or that <em>(Mother turns her hands inwards and outwards in turn)</em>. How? Where?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2607"><em>But what should be done then? Should people wait, or what?</em></p>

<p class="PE"> was going to happen. Well, that's what I think must happen to those who... who die in a state of grace ‚Äì it's true, some people die well and others don't. It all depends on one's state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2610">If at death you withdraw from physical circumstances, from ordinary physical consciousness, and unite with the great universal Force, or the divine Presence, then all these little things....

Within the great mass of humanity, many bodies are no longer good for anything, and in such cases it may very well be a relief to be separated from your body abruptly, instead of waiting for a slow decomposition. So... once again I am saying to myself, ‚ÄúA rash and hasty judgment ‚Äì the judgment of Ignorance.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2618">I can't say. Each individual has to <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FEEL</span> it and, if he's conscious enough, say what he would like.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2619">But each time I ask my body what <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IT</span> would like, all the cells say, ‚ÄúNo, no! We are immortal, we want to be immortal.

This research is tending towards the conclusion that aging is merely a bad habit ‚Äì which seems to be true. Which means that when you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVE</span> in the Truth-Consciousness, Matter is not in contradiction to that Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2622">And this is just what I am realizing (I don't think it's anything unique or exceptional): the closer one draws to the cell itself, the more the cell says, ‚ÄúBut I am immortal!‚Äù Only it must become conscious. But this takes place almost automatically: the brain cells are very conscious; the cells of the hands and arms of musicians are very conscious; with athletes and gymnasts, the cells of the entire body are wonderfully conscious. So, being conscious, those cells become conscious of their principle of immortality and say, ‚ÄúWhy would I want to grow old? Why!‚Äù They don't want to grow old. It is very interesting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2653">I have studied this realm extensively.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 388</p>
<p class="PE"> It is a world of creation with several levels or degrees.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2654"><em>Yes, I'd like to understand how it works. I have to talk about it in the book.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2655">The first zone you encounter is the zone of painting, sculpture, architecture: everything that has a material form. It is the zone of forms, colored forms that are expressed as paintings, sculptures, and architecture. They are not forms as we know them, but rather typal forms; you can see garden types, for instance, wonderfully colored and beautiful, or construction types.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2656">Then comes the musical zone, and there you find the origin of the sounds that have inspired the various composers. Great waves of music, without sound. It seems a bit strange, but that's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2657"><em>But do you hear something when you play, or what?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2658">When I play I generally hear what I am playing. It's hard to say.... It's not just an ordinary sound, it's a combination of sounds, and it's not... no, it's true, it's not the same sound but something like the essence of that sound. But for instance, I have a sort of feeling that what I am hearing should be expressed by a large orchestra.... I <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEE</span> it, you know, I see something like large orchestras around me, on my right, on my left ‚Äì and I am supposed to transcribe it on a harmonium! It's like an orchestra made up of groups of musicians, with each group expressing one part of that combination, which is a much more complete sound than the ear can perceive. That's what it is. It's not something you can express just by humming a little tune, but a whole body of musical vibrations. And as I hear it, I see how it should be expressed. I see large orchestras around me. But it's another kind of vision; it's not the precise vision of the physical eye, but something very... it's how consciousness sees. How can I describe it! All you can say is that it's not our normal kind of vision, or hearing, either.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2659">It's quite a total knowledge, which includes a vision, an awareness of the combination of sounds and how they should be expressed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2660">Beyond the musical zone lies thought: thoughts, organized thoughts for plays and books, abstractions for philosophies. But what used to interest me particularly were the combinations that give birth to novels or plays.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2661">That is the third zone.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 389</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2662"><em>Does one hear sounds in the intellectual zone?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2663">No, what you find there are thought formations that are expressed in each person's brain in his own language. There are thought combinations for novels, plays, even philosophical systems. They are combinations of pure thought, not formulated in any language, but they are automatically expressed in each one's brain according to his particular language. It is the domain of pure thought. That's where you work when you want to work for the whole earth; you don't send out thoughts formulated in words, you send out a pure thought, which then formulates itself in any language in any brain: in all those who are receptive. These formations are at anyone's disposal ‚Äì nobody can say, ‚ÄúIt's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MY</span> idea, it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MY</span> book.‚Äù Anyone capable of ascending to that zone can get hold of the formations and transcribe them materially. I once made an experiment of that kind; I wanted to see what would happen, so I made a formation myself and let it go off on its way. And in the same year, two quite different people, who didn't even know each other, one in England and the other in America, got hold of my formation; the one in England wrote a book, while the one in America created a play. And circumstances so arranged themselves that both the book and the play found their way to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2664">Higher up, there is a fourth zone, a zone of colored lights, plays of colored lights. That's the order: first form, then sound, then ideas, then colored lights. But that zone is already more distant from humanity; it is a zone of forces, a zone which appears as colored lights. No forms ‚Äì colored lights representing forces. And one can combine these forces so</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 390</p>
<p class="PE"> that they work in the terrestrial atmosphere and bring about certain events. It's a zone of action, independent of form, sound and thought; it is above all that. A zone of active power and might you can use for a particular purpose ‚Äì if you have the capacity to do so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2665">That's the highest zone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2666">Thus we have form, expressed in painting, sculpture or architecture; sound, expressed in musical themes; and thought, expressed in books, plays, novels, or even in philosophical and other kinds of intellectual theories (that's where you can send out ideas that will affect the whole world, because they influence receptive brains in any land, and are expressed by corresponding thoughts in the appropriate language). And above this zone, free of form, sound and though, is the play of forces appearing as colored lights. And when you go there and have the power, you can combine those forces so that they eventually materialize as creations on earth (it takes some time, it's rarely immediate).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2667"><em>But those great waves of music you hear, which you said were beyond sounds ‚Äì are they part of that domain of luminous vibrations?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2668">Yes.... But it's the higher level of the musical zone. Each of these zones contains several levels, and the top of the musical zone is already starting to be waves, waves of vibration. But it's still directly related to music, while those colored forces I am speaking of have to do with terrestrial transformations and actions ‚Äì great actions. They are powers of action. This zone where you hear no sound eventually becomes sounds and music. It is the summit. Each zone contains several levels.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2669"><em>In short, when one rises to that Origin, one finds a single vibration, which can be expressed as music or thought or architectural or pictorial forms ‚Äì is that right?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2670">Yes, but it goes through specific transformations en route. It passes through one zone or another, where it undergoes transformations to adapt itself to the particular mode of expression. The waves of music are one particular mode of expression of those colored waves ‚Äì they should really be called ‚Äúluminous‚Äù waves, for they are self-luminous. Waves of colored light. Great waves of colored light.</p>

Man, on the other hand, who doesn't get what he wants the way he wants it, must make an effort to create forms, and that's why he progresses ‚Äì art is a great means of spiritual progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2672"><em>But about those great waves of music that interest me ‚Äì I had the impression they must be located well above the world of thought....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2673">It's not exactly like geography, you know!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2674">But anyway, it's right on the border of the higher hemisphere.... It's the first expression of Consciousness as joy. I remember finding that same vibration of joy in Beethoven and Bach (in Mozart also, but to a lesser degree). The first time I heard Beethoven's concerto in D ‚Äì in D major, for violin and orchestra... suddenly the violin starts up (it's not right at the beginning ‚Äì first there's an orchestral passage and then the violin takes it up), and with the first notes of the violin (Ysaye was playing, what a musician!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="198" href="#">2</a>), with the very first notes my head suddenly seemed to burst open, and I was cast into such splendor....

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2675">And mind you, I knew nothing of all those worlds, I hadn't the slightest knowledge; but all my experiences came that way ‚Äì unexpectedly, without my seeking anything.

Unless you have the experience of what you translate, you can't translate it. Then I suddenly realized that the Chinese can't translate the way we do! In Chinese, each character represents an idea rather than a separate word; the basis is ideas, not words and their meanings, so translation must be a completely different kind of work for them. So I started identifying with H.S.,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 393</p>
<p class="PE"> to understand how he is translating Sri Aurobindo's <em>Synthesis of Yoga</em> into Chinese characters ‚Äì he's had to find new characters! It was very interesting. He must have invented characters. Chinese characters are made up of root-signs, and the meaning changes according to the positions of the root-signs. Each root-sign can be simplified, depending on where it's placed in combination with other root-signs ‚Äì at the top of the character, at the bottom, or to one side or the other. And so, finding the right combination for new ideas must be a fascinating task! (I don't know how many root-signs can be put in one character, but some characters are quite large and must contain a lot of them; as a matter of fact, I have been shown characters expressing new scientific discoveries, and they were very big.) But how interesting it must be to work with new ideas that way! And H.S. calls it a ‚Äúmechanical task.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2696">It's like that famous Nirvana ‚Äì you can find it behind everything. There's a psychic nirvana, a mental nirvana, even a vital nirvana. I think I already told you about the experience I had with Tagore in Japan. Tagore always used to say that as soon as he started meditating he entered Nirvana, and he asked me to meditate with him. We sat together in meditation. I was expecting to make a very steep ascent, but he simply went into his <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MIND</span>, and there... (what I do, you see, is tune in to the person I am meditating with, identify with him ‚Äì that's how I know what happens). Well, he started meditating, and everything quite rapidly came to a halt, became absolutely immobile (this he did very well), and from there he sort of fell backwards, and it was Nothingness. And he could remain in that state indefinitely! We did in fact stay like that for a rather long time; I don't remember how long, three quarters of an hour or an hour, but anyway it was long enough. I was keeping alert the whole time to see if, by chance, he would go on into something else, but there he stayed ‚Äì he stayed there nice and calm, without stirring. Then he came back, his mind started up again, and that was that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2697">I said nothing to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2698">But it was a true nirvana: Nothingness. Not a single sensation, not a movement ‚Äì no thoughts, of course ‚Äì nothing, not a vibration: just like that, Nirvana. So I quite naturally concluded that there is a nirvana behind the mind, since he went there directly. And through my own experiments in the different zones of the being I became aware that, indeed, there is a nirvana behind everything (there must be a nirvana behind the physical cell too ‚Äì maybe that's what death is! Who knows, it's possible). A nothingness, nothing stirs any more. And nothing's there any more ‚Äì nothing's there, there's nothing to stir <em>(Mother laughs)</em>. It's the Nothing.</p>

And it's simply the inner Divine: there's no need to fly off to the heights, it's right here <em>(Mother touches her heart)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2748">It's the experience I had in 1912. The first contact, when you go within and then <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT'S IT</span>... that concrete reality, that intensity beyond any possible physical intensity.

You <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ARE</span> the Divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2749">That's the experience. It's the base, the basic experience. Once you have it, you may progress more or less rapidly; although if you truly give yourself, you progress very rapidly. Externally you are in a position where, having that experience, you could cover the whole path in a matter of years and straight-away begin the work of transformation <em>(Mother touches her body)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2750">To have it (just to give you an idea) took me a year of exclusive concentration on finding that within myself ‚Äì that is, to enter into contact with the immanent God. I did nothing but that, thought of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 400</p>
<p class="PE"> nothing but that, wanted nothing but that. There was even a rather funny instance, because I had resolved to do it (I had already been working for a very long time, of course; Madame Th√©on had told me about my mission on earth and all that, so you can imagine ‚Äì I am talking about the psychic being belonging to this present creation, this formation ‚Äì <em>Mother touches her body</em>)... anyway, it was New Year's Eve and I decided: ‚ÄúWithin the coming year.‚Äù I had a large, almost square studio, a bit bigger than this room, with a door leading onto a patio. I opened the little door and looked at the sky and there, just as I looked, was a shooting star. You know the tradition: if you formulate an aspiration just as you see a shooting star, before the star disappears, it will be realized within the year. And there, just as I opened the door, was a shooting star ‚Äì I was totally in my aspiration: ‚ÄúUnion with the inner Divine.‚Äù And before the end of December of the following year, I had the experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2751">But I was entirely concentrated on that. I was in Paris, and I did nothing else but that; when I walked down the street, I was thinking only of that. One day, as I was crossing the Boulevard Saint Michel, I was almost run over (I've told you this), because I was thinking of nothing but that ‚Äì concentrating, concentrating... like sitting in front of a closed door, and it was painful! <em>(intense gesture to the chest)</em> Physically painful, from the pressure. And then suddenly, for no apparent reason ‚Äì I was neither more concentrated nor anything else ‚Äì poof! It opened. And with that.... It didn't just last for hours, it lasted for months, mon petit! It didn't leave me, that light, that dazzling light, that light and immensity. And the sense of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> willing, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> knowing, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> ruling the whole life, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> guiding everything ‚Äì since then, this sense has never left me for a minute. And always, whenever I had a decision to make, I would simply stop for a second and receive the indication from there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2752">But that was ages ago. I have done a lot of things since then. It was long ago, in 1912. And now... oh, this old carcass!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2793">.,. It's somewhat similar to collecting one's thoughts. It's part concentration, part interiorization, and both together ‚Äì like drawing back, but without movement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2794">After a while, it becomes almost automatic; I do it hundreds of times a day. It's difficult to describe, because the description makes it too concrete. But it's a drawing back, an interiorization ‚Äì a <em>self-gathering</em>. But all those words seem dense, heavy; too material, too heavy. Yet it's a very concrete sensation, very concrete, which immediately brings about a kind of stabilization ‚Äì everything stops. Everything stops, to the point where even a vibration of pain is stopped, it doesn't exist any more. But when you leave this state, back it comes again.

First of all, Sri Aurobindo was there ‚Äì it was like a large hall: a very large room with scarcely any walls, just enough so it didn't seem wide open to everything. And then there was a kind of musical instrument, like a grand piano, but much bigger and higher, playing its own music: nobody was playing it. And its ‚Äúown music‚Äù was the music of what you have written. It was taking the form of... something like luminous, colored sheets of paper, tinged with gold, with pink, which were scattering in the air and then very slowly falling onto a floor that was scarcely a floor, with an almost birdlike movement. They were falling, falling ‚Äì almost square sheets of paper falling one upon another like feathers ‚Äì nothing heavy about it. And then from the left a being like a god from the overmind entered the room; he was both like a Hindu deity with a tiara, and a kind of angel in a long robe (a combination of the two), and he moved so lightly, without touching the ground ‚Äì he was all lightness. And with a very lovely and harmonious movement (everything was so harmonious!), he gathered up all the sheets: he took them in his arms and they stayed there ‚Äì they were weightless, you see. He gathered them up, smiling all the while, with a young and very, very luminous and happy face ‚Äì something very lovely. Then, when he had gathered them all up, he turned towards me (I was here; you were over there, the music was there and Sri Aurobindo was there), and said as he was leaving, ‚ÄúI am taking all this to give to them,‚Äù as if he were returning to the overmental world where they were greatly interested in it! <em>(Mother laughs)</em></p>

At the beginning my attention was divided between what you were reading and what was going on; afterwards it was entirely focused on what was happening: your sheets of paper falling and landing weightlessly, like birds, and spreading over a floor that wasn't solid (it was there just to give the impression of a room, but you could see through it). And while you were reading, he was gathering them all up, with a long robe trailing behind him. This being was made of practically the same substance as the sheets coming out of the piano (it was a kind of piano, it was playing music, but it was the principle of what you have written). So he gathered up everything, and when he had a stack this big, he said, ‚ÄúI am going to take it and show it to them.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2821">Because my impression was that the higher I rise, the more I notice things below. I wasn't making a doctrine or theory of it, of course ‚Äì I got rid of that habit a long time ago. But I was looking at it, merely taking note of the fact, without telling myself it was for this or that reason (as you explain here in your book). I observed the phenomenon and was able to say: the more I feel this constant, luminous Presence, the more I see those things. So it has become very clear to me that it is impossible to manifest <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> integrally without everything below being offered up to the Light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2822">My method is essentially very simple: for each thing that comes, I say, ‚ÄúHere, Lord, it's for You; change it, transform it.‚Äù A work of offering and dedication <em>(gesture of presenting something to the Light)</em>. And this morning there was a sort of reply ‚Äì not exactly to a question, but as though I were wondering ‚ÄúHow do I do it?‚Äù (because the Lord tells me I am here for His work), ‚ÄúHow do I do His work? What's the new way of doing the Work? We know all the old ways, but what's the new way?‚Äù And the reply came, very concrete, without words: ‚ÄúBy bringing the two extremes together.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 413</p>
<p class="PE"> Everything you see, everything that comes to you or that you discover is automatically put in the presence of the Most High, of the Supreme. You join the two extremes. Your whole work is to make the junction.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2823">And now you read me all this! It's as if you were explaining it ‚Äì don't you find that interesting! <em>(Mother laughs)</em> I find it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2824">And what's more, this morning Sri Aurobindo said to me, ‚ÄúToday he will tell you something that will explain your experiences to you.‚Äù So that's what has happened.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2825">He was here again just now and told me (how shall I put it?)... something like: <em>he receives well</em>, as though he were dictating a lot of things to you.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Concerning the Sino-Indian conflict along the Himalayan border:)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2831">X wrote N. to announce ‚Äì in precise and almost violent terms ‚Äì that it was the beginning of a general upheaval, a catastrophic world war.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 414</p>
<p class="PE"> I know it's the will of that Asura I've mentioned to you several times, the Lord of Falsehood who was born the Lord of Truth, and who knows that his hour is at hand (‚Äúat hand‚Äù relative to that world there) and has declared he will cause as much havoc as he can before disappearing. Quite recently, just before the present conflict broke out, I went to a realm in the vital world which is right above the earth, like a platform (not a mountain top, but a spot where you get an overall view, like the bridge of a ship, for instance, where the captain stands; it was a place like that in the vital world, overlooking all terrestrial life). I went there ‚Äì it was rather dark, very dark in fact ‚Äì and that tall being was there (he's quite tall, higher than this room ‚Äì <em>Mother looks up at the ceiling</em> ‚Äì he likes to look tall). He's very tall and all black. (That's more or less his natural state; he appears to humans blazing with light, but that doesn't fool someone with inner vision: it's an icy light. But some people are fooled and take him for the supreme God. Anyway, that's an aside.) So he was there and I went to him ‚Äì not to him: I went to that place and found him there. He was gloating and told me to take a look around.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2832">From there you had a panoramic view of everything. And no sooner did I arrive than a storm broke out ‚Äì a terrible storm. I kept watching, and then I saw in this direction (I don't know whether it was north, south or west, but it was this direction: <em>Mother points to the north</em>), I saw two nearly simultaneous flashes of lightning. The first one (I was looking north, I was quite conscious of facing north)... the first one, a terrific bolt, came and fell from the east; and just a moment after, very soon after, another came from the west. The two didn't come together, but they fell on the same spot ‚Äì they didn't meet but they fell on the same spot. It was pitch dark, the earth and everything was dark, you couldn't see a thing, and suddenly those two flashes of lightning lit up the area where they fell, making a dreadful din, and (my field of vision was confined to that area; all the rest was in darkness, you see)... it burst into flames! Everything was set ablaze. In the lightning flashes you could distinguish the tops of monuments, houses, all sorts of things, and then everything burst into flames: a dreadful conflagration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2833">I even remarked to myself (it was a rather curious feeling), ‚ÄúWell, it's interesting to have such a close view of it.‚Äù That is, I had the feeling that my ‚Äústation,‚Äù as Sri Aurobindo calls it, for viewing the world was very high up, and I'd had to come down to that place. And that's what made me say, ‚ÄúWell, it's interesting to have such a close view of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 415</p>
<p class="PE"> things.‚Äù (I didn't say it to that being, I thought it.) And he was there next to me, gloating, standing some distance off to my right (looking up, I could see his head ‚Äì <em>Mother looks up at the ceiling</em>). He was jubilant, gloating: ‚ÄúYou see, you see, you see!‚Äù Overjoyed. I kept absolutely still; everything was still, calm, motionless (the thought that came was like something passing through me: ‚ÄúIt's interesting to have such a close view of it‚Äù). And then I stopped everything, like this <em>(Mother remains as still as a statue, fists clenched)</em>. And very soon afterwards (I can't say exactly because time there isn't the same as here), very soon afterwards, everything stopped.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="207" href="#">1</a> The storm's only purpose was to cause the two thunderbolts, and it stopped after they fell on the earth. And then the flames... the whole area was set ablaze (it was like a huge city, but not a city: most likely it was symbolic of a country): vroom! It burst into flames; some flames were leaping up very, very high. But I simply did this, stopped everything <em>(Mother remains motionless, eyes closed, fists clenched)</em>, and then looked out once again ‚Äì everything had returned to order. Then I said (I don't know why, but I was speaking to him in English... yes, it's because he was speaking English, saying, <em>‚ÄúYou see, you see!‚Äù</em>), I said, ‚ÄúAh, that didn't last long. They quickly brought it under control.‚Äù With that he turned his back on me <em>(laughing);</em> he went off one way and I the other. Then I regained my outer consciousness, which is why I remember everything exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2834">I believe they began fighting up there two or three days after it happened.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2835">What can the west side be?...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2836">I don't know. I thought it would be Russia, but Russia seems to be trying its hardest not to interfere. I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2837"><em>Was it India that was struck?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2838">Yes, of course, it was India.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2839">When I thought, ‚ÄúIt's interesting to have such a close view of it all,‚Äù there was also a sense of being physically close, a part of me felt physically very close. But you know, I have been close to all the wars (the two previous ones ‚Äì this is the third), as close as can be: shells were falling on Paris when I was there, during the first war.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 416</p>
<p class="PE"> So that's what was shown to me in images.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2840">Apart from that, when the news got here that they'd begun amiably killing one another for nothing, as soon as I knew it, I put over the whole border the same thing as that night: Peace and Immobility. Two days later I asked for news. ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I was told, ‚Äúthey seem tired out. They're no longer doing anything.‚Äù</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2841">They are scarcely moving any more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2842">And then there have been certain political problems<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="208" href="#">2</a> ‚Äì all this making for a bit of work, which turned out rather well. But it's always mixed, never the full thing; there's always a result, but not <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> result.... I don't think ‚Äúthe‚Äù result is possible with the present conditions on earth: it would be a miracle, upsetting too many things. The consequences would be worse than....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2843">Well, then.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2844">I've had my eye on this gentleman since the Second World War (and even earlier), and I know that's just what he wants. He has foretold all sorts of catastrophic things. So I suppose that's what X is seeing too, without knowing where it comes from ‚Äì I don't know. I wonder.... At any rate, he wrote it so categorically that you might nearly think he wanted it!... I can't believe he wants it. I simply replied, ‚ÄúWell, yes, it's <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> possibility.‚Äù Which of the two will prevail? That, I don't know. It's a secret the Lord doesn't reveal... because He thinks (and this is altogether certain) that it wouldn't be good to know what's going to happen ‚Äì we wouldn't do what had to be done. It's always that way: we don't know what's going to happen because then we wouldn't do what had to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2845">I do what He tells me to do, but He doesn't say what the consequences will be. And I don't ask Him; I know it's none of my business.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2846">For if I knew, even if I didn't tell, it would spread <em>(Mother shows waves spreading out from her head)</em>. And it's not good that people know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2847">But I've had lots and lots of visions of all types, from the most frightful to the most wonderful ‚Äì all very apocalyptic, in the realm of the incredible. Many, many things, detailed as well as general. They would fill a volume.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 417</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2848"><em>I don't know, I have the feeling that humanity isn't ready for peace and needs to be shaken up.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2849">Yes, unfortunately it's not ready.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2850">They're falling into a stupor.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2852">It's a pity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2853">Because it can set things back thousands of years.... For there are moments when things converge, and it is rare to have a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MOMENT</span> in this Story: it stretches over long, long, almost indefinite periods of time. So to get a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MOMENT</span> that becomes something actual in terrestrial life <em>(Mother drives her fist into the Earth)</em> is very difficult. And if that moment is passed by, is missed....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2854">But I always wonder... because Sri Aurobindo left without revealing his secret. He said he was leaving <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DELIBERATELY</span> ‚Äì that much he told me. He told me what I needed to know. But he never said the moment hadn't come (you see, he thought... he came saying the time had come), he never said if he'd seen that things were not sufficiently ready. He told me ‚Äúthe world is not ready,‚Äù that much he did say. He told me he was going away deliberately because it was ‚Äúnecessary,‚Äù and that I had to stay and continue the work, that I would continue. He said those three things. But he never told me whether or not I would succeed! He never told me whether or not I could bring the moment back.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2855">And I must say I am past the point where it's interesting to know these things, because... I live a bit too much in the eternity of time for that to be very important.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2856">But outwardly, from what I have seen, from all I've observed (I mean the more I am <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">IN</span> the thing): the world is not ready. People... they don't even understand what it is! So how could they.... When you tell them something or show them something from up here <em>(gesture above)</em>, they don't understand. They don't understand. To make it understandable, they immediately distort it, disfigure it. So... I don't know whether....</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2857">But strangely enough, ever since these people began fighting up there <span class="note_0">[along the Himalayan border]</span>, the earth has been more receptive.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 418</p>
<p class="PE"> Yet people have fought before ‚Äì people have fought everywhere, haven't they? Since the last war they have never stopped fighting in one place or another: in Africa, in Asia, everywhere. They've been constantly fighting. There was always something, constantly. This whole Algerian story... terrible things went on there; and all the trouble in the Congo and so forth ‚Äì battles everywhere. But... I don't know why (it's not that I wasn't concerned with these events, they were in my consciousness), but this time two things have happened: a greater Power has descended (something very concrete, almost tangible), a great Power has descended, has been especially sent; and also a certain receptivity ‚Äì everywhere, even in the Chinese (I don't mean locally: it's all over the world). Is it because, materially, there's some anxiety at the idea of...? If a new world war starts, it's obviously going to be something unspeakable, frightful, frightful ‚Äì whole civilizations will be swallowed up. It will put a stop to life on earth in a terrible way. Is that what made people...? Has this awakened some aspiration? Possibly. There's clearly a greater receptivity. I see this from the fact that whenever the Will spreads out <em>(Mother makes a gesture of emanation)</em>, well, it has a more concrete and more immediate effect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2858">The other conflicts were really very superficial, like minor ailments ‚Äì skin diseases! Superficial things. There were some appalling horrors, utterly repugnant things, too, everywhere (I remember what happened in Algeria, I was kept informed and I knew what took place: horrible things)... and yet they seemed... yes, they seemed like skin diseases of the earth! They were very superficial. But then suddenly up there <span class="note_0">[in Nefa and Ladakh]</span>, oh, it became something different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2859">That was the impression: a very localized disease (anyone can catch it, but it's still very localized). While here, this conflict seems to have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FUNDAMENTALLY</span> disrupted something ‚Äì profoundly. Is it because people <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THINK</span> it may have a global consequence?... I don't know. Or is it truly the first sign of something very... very momentous?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2860">One day (for me now, everything is part of an extremely precise play of forces)... and one day I had a sort of sensation of one of those profound upheavals... something very widespread and full of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">GREAT</span> pain.

<p class="p-num">Page 419</p>
<p class="PE"> stabilized, stopped, and there was a splendor of Light. But I received no response. Except for that splendor of Light ‚Äì something triumphant, you know. But it may just as well mean that no matter what happens, this will always be there ‚Äì which is obvious.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2861">I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2862">Somewhere, in a place which is not here <span class="note_0">[physically]</span>, some place <em>(Mother gestures into the distance behind her being)</em>, there is something that keeps very still, somewhere, very still and beyond all the movements of forces; something seated, as it were, established somewhere, very still and beyond public observation (by ‚Äúpublic‚Äù I don't necessarily mean ‚Äúterrestrial,‚Äù I mean the whole world), something that keeps like this <em>(gesture backwards, eyes closed, motionless as a statue)</em>, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DOES NOT WANT IT</span>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2863">I perceive that very distinctly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2864">In other words, a part of the being is there ‚Äì a part of the Creative Force ‚Äì and it does <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOT</span> want it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2865">As if it has truly been decided that this time the experience will go right to the end, right to its goal, without interruption. And this something which... <span class="note_0">[doesn't want]</span>. The Something that has made the decision and sticks to it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2867">I refrained from saying anything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2868">And with the consciousness here, I looked (of course I was asked how he could write or think such things), and I said that each realm has its own determinism, and if you see only that determinism, things seem absolutely decreed. X's vision, I said, belongs to the vital-physical determinism of the earth (Life and Matter), in which the catastrophe seems inevitable; but there are higher realms whose intervention can change everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2869">But one must see and live in those higher regions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2870">In X's case, his personal contact rises to the heights, but it's purely personal. While his overall vision (I am not saying universal: overall) stops at the vital-physical plane, with a touch of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 420</p>
<p class="PE"> the mental, and <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT'S ALL</span>. There's a contradiction between his personal possibility, which reaches very high (although on quite a tenuous peak), and his overall vision. When his attention turns outward, it is very limited; it may be terrestrial, but it's... it's crusted over, so to speak.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2871">So that's the explanation I gave. But the truth....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2875">But everything Sri Aurobindo said has always come true. You know he also said (but it was in jest, he didn't write it)... concerning reuniting with Pakistan he told me: ‚ÄúTen years. It will take ten years.‚Äù The ten years passed and nothing happened ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">OFFICIALLY</span> nothing happened. But the truth is (I learned it through certain government officials), Pakistan did make some overtures in that direction, asking for a union to be reestablished (they would have kept some sort of autonomy, but the two countries would have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNITED</span>, it would have been a <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">UNION</span>), and Nehru refused.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2876"><em>How foolish!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2877">So Sri Aurobindo had seen it.</p>

It was a repetition of the same stupidity as when Cripps came to make his proposal, when Sri Aurobindo sent a message saying, ‚ÄúAccept, whatever the conditions, otherwise it will be worse later on.‚Äù That's what Sri Aurobindo told them.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2883">It's true that they deserve it! They have acted perfectly stupidly all along. Out of ambition, vanity, all sorts of things, but especially out of stupidity and total lack of understanding ‚Äì a blind vision, reaching no farther than their noses.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2886">August 15th, 1947 is the birthday of free India. It marks for her the end of an old era, the beginning of a new age. But we can also make it by our life and acts as a free nation an important date in a new age opening for the whole world, for the political, social, cultural and spiritual future of humanity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2887">August 15th is my own birthday and it is naturally gratifying to me that it should have assumed this vast significance. I take this coincidence, not as a fortuitous accident, but as the sanction and seal of the Divine Force that guides my steps on the work with which I began life, the beginning of its full fruition. Indeed, on this day I can watch almost all the world-movements which I hoped to see fulfilled in my lifetime, though then they looked like impracticable dreams, arriving at fruition or on their way to achievement. In all these movements free India may well play a large part and take a leading position.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2888">The first of these dreams was a revolutionary movement which would create a free and united India. India today is free but she has not achieved unity. (...) The old communal division into Hindus and Muslims seems now to have hardened into a permanent political division of the country. It is to be hoped that this settled fact will not be accepted as settled for ever or as anything more than a temporary expedient. For if it lasts, India may be seriously weakened, even crippled: civil strife may remain always possible, possible even a new invasion and foreign conquest. India's internal development and prosperity may be impeded, her position among the nations weakened, her destiny impaired or even frustrated.

Truman seems to have understood the situation if we can judge from his moves in Korea, but it is to be seen whether he is strong enough and determined enough to carry the matter through. The measures he has taken are likely to be incomplete and unsuccessful, since they do not include any actual military intervention except on sea and in the air. That seems to be the situation; we have to see how it develops. One thing is certain that if there is too much shillyshallying and if America gives up now her defence of Korea, she may be driven to yield position after position until it is too late: at one point or another she will have to stand and face the necessity of drastic action even if it leads to war. Stalin also seems not to be ready to face at once the risk of a world war and, if so, Truman can turn the tables on him by constantly facing him with the onus of either taking that risk or yielding position after position to America. I think that is all that I can see at present; for the moment the situation is as grave as it can be.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="216" href="#">10</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-207"><sup>1</sup> In fact, three days later, on November 20, in an unhoped-for turn of events, China declared a unilateral cease-fire and withdrawal of troops, even as they were making a spectacular and almost unopposed advance. No one ever understood why.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-208"><sup>2</sup> Mother is probably alluding to difficulties in obtaining the dismissal of the Defense Minister, Krishna Menon. It might be recalled that, under Nehru, India's foreign policy was quite pro-Chinese (the slogan of the day was <em>Hindi-Chini-bha√Ø-bha√Ø</em>: Indians and Chinese are brothers), and when China began to sweep down into India, the Defense Minister calmly left for London on some mission or other, declaring: oh, it's nothing!</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-209"><sup>3</sup> See Addendum.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-210"><sup>4</sup> This may refer to the death of Liaquat Ali, and the grave economic and political difficulties resulting in the dissolution of the Pakistani Parliament in October 1958, and General Ayub Khan's seizure of power.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-211"><sup>5</sup> In April 1942, when England was struggling against the Nazis and Japan, which was threatening to invade Burma and India, Churchill sent an emissary, Sir Stafford Cripps, to New Delhi with a very generous proposal which he hoped would rally India's goodwill and cooperation in the fight against the worldwide threat. In this proposal, Great Britain offered India Dominion status, as a first step towards an independent government. Sri Aurobindo at once came out of retirement to wire his adhesion to Cripps; he wired all of India's leaders, and even sent a personal messenger to Gandhi and the Indian Congress to convince them to accept this unhoped for proposal without delay. One of Sri Aurobindo's telegrams to Rajagopalachari (the future President of India) spoke of the grave danger, which no one seemed to see, of rejecting Cripps' proposal: ‚Äú...Some immediate solution urgent face grave peril. Appeal to you to save India formidable danger new foreign domination when old on way to self-elimination.‚Äù No one understood: ‚ÄúWhy is he meddling?‚Äù Had it accepted Dominion status, India would have avoided the partition of the country in two, the artificial creation of Pakistan, as well as the three wars that were to follow (and which we haven't heard the last of), and the blood bath that ravaged Bengal and the Punjab in 1947 at the time of the partition. (See in Addendum an extract from Sri Aurobindo's message on the occasion of India's Independence.)</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-212"><sup>6</sup> There is another side to the story. When Nehru died, Mother said in a message of May 27, 1964: <em>‚ÄúNehru leaves his body but his soul is ONE with the Soul of India, that lives for Eternity.‚Äù</em></p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-213"><sup>7</sup> All the same, Satprem did keep this conversation, being unable to censor Mother's words or to delete them from History ‚Äì for where is the borderline between censorship and falsehood?</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-214"><sup>8</sup> Seven weeks after India's Independence and the creation of Pakistan, Pakistan invaded Kashmir.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn-215"><sup>9</sup> Tibet was invaded four months later, on October 21. India did not protest.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2894">So that's their intention ‚Äì to settle there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2895"><em>It's not very clear why.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2898">Why did they take Tibet?</p>

<p class="Q">(silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2900">And this side of Bengal and Assam is full of Chinese who settled there years and years ago; there are thousands and thousands of them, doing business. And all the communists support them, and it seems they keep a very accurate and meticulous list of those for and those against communism. (What do they base it on? I don't know ‚Äì on what people say or do.) And the idea is that it's all going to be taken like this <em>(gesture of encircling India)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2901">It's nasty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2902">Things seem to be taking a nasty turn.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2903"><em>But what I find perhaps even more incredible than the leaders' incompetence ‚Äì Nehru, Menon, and so forth ‚Äì is that for twenty years there hasn't been a single Indian to see things clearly and speak out ‚Äì there's been no one in India, no one.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2905">But Nehru had a very good foreign press. They considered him almost a god in Europe and America. And Gandhi!... Oh, they were.... The whole world is like that, mon petit ‚Äì they don't understand. They don't understand. Nobody understands.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2908">Maybe we'll see from another world. <em>(Laughing)</em> It's possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2909">They have bombs in America and Russia (China hasn't boasted about it, but they may have some too) that can destroy a whole city ‚Äì one is more than enough, you don't need two. The Russians in particular: a single bomb and a whole city, even the size of London: vroom! Nothing left. (That's the theory, but still, there's always something true in it.) We saw what happened to Hiroshima, it was pretty bad. Well, if that was ten, then what they have now is a thousand ‚Äì that's the proportion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2910">In other words, they've turned all their intelligence towards destruction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2911">Some say, ‚ÄúIt will deter them from fighting.‚Äù But that's childish!</p>
<p class="Q">(long silence)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2912">China has already recalled its ambassador from Delhi. The Indians haven't recalled theirs from Peking, but they'll be forced to. This kind of thing can't be <em>one-sided</em>, one side recalling its ambassador and the other side leaving theirs; and the minute they recall their ambassador, the bombing starts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2913">Not many airplanes have pilots nowadays ‚Äì that's old-fashioned. The planes do their business all by themselves. They are completely automatic. So what's needed is truly a Power that can act on the most mechanical matter. I mean for protection, for instance: these things don't depend on human wills, nor even on beings of the terrestrial atmosphere ‚Äì the Supreme alone can decide. Just as He decides ‚ÄúThis is to be done,‚Äù so He also decides... <span class="note_0">[ ‚ÄúThis won't be‚Äù ]</span>. That's all. He is the only recourse.</p>

<p class="PE"> protecting you, fine, nothing will happen to you. But as far as knowing what He's going to decide.... For if He decides upon such a destruction, it means the earth truly needs it ‚Äì otherwise He wouldn't decide it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2915">Anyway, it's best not to think about it ‚Äì we'll see soon enough. We'll see from this world here or from a more subtle one <em>(laughing)</em>, that's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2916">All I know is that it was a very bad night, and I woke up this morning completely drained and with plenty of difficulties ‚Äì and it's not over yet.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="218" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="Ps">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2917"><em>Later:</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2918">If things take a bad turn, soon no one will be able to move; once again we'll be <em>(gesture)</em> shut up in an egg.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2919">When Sri Aurobindo was here, you went to sit in the room he was in, and felt perfectly sheltered from everything ‚Äì and it was true.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2920">The only danger at the time was Japan, and Japan had officially declared it wouldn't bomb Pondicherry because of Sri Aurobindo. But at least there were still men in their planes, and they could choose not to bomb. But you don't tell a <em>jet plane</em> ‚ÄúDon't crash here‚Äù! It crashes wherever it can.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2921"><em>Yes, but it's still hard to see why they would come here.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2922">If they want to bomb Madras, that's just too close. Between the oil wells in Assam (that's what they want ‚Äì very useful to have...) and the Chinese, there's the same distance as between Pondicherry and Madras, so you understand.... They certainly have a motorized army, so it's nothing at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2923">Anyhow....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2924">And all night long (or a good part of it in any case), Indira Gandhi's thought was here, clinging to me (Indira Gandhi is Nehru's daughter), and the jewelry was sent to her.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="219" href="#">3</a> It was handed over to Nehru, who passed it on to Indira.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="220" href="#">4</a> And she wrote me a letter I received yesterday ‚Äì a very <em>(Mother searches for the proper word)</em>... a very</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 427</p>
<p class="PE"> amicable letter; a letter from someone who has understood that this gift was an important element ‚Äì not on a worldwide level (!), but because it was important that people know I have made a gesture of collaboration. But it didn't end there. The letter came yesterday; generally, of course, when I see a letter coming, I see it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BEFORE</span> receiving it; but here it was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SHE</span>, she herself, thinking <span class="note_0">[of Mother]</span>, thinking, thinking, thinking over and over again. (With Nehru, it's always very blurred: he doesn't have sufficient mental power for his position, he lacks the required strength of mind, so it's always hazy; when you tune in to him, that's the impression you get ‚Äì <em>blurred gesture</em> ‚Äì not solid.) But with her, it kept coming and coming and coming. They must be feeling... or beginning to feel that something other than what they have is required.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2925">We shall see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2926">I don't forget what Sri Aurobindo said ‚Äì declared (in writing): that in 1967 the supramental Power will be behind all the earth's governments. Whether it's these people or those or whoever, they will be directly, maybe not consciously, but directly under the influence of the supramental forces, which will make them do what has to be done. And so, of course, the first result will be a kind of worldwide collaboration ‚Äì he explicitly told me that, and he wrote it down. That's what he had seen. But he didn't say we would get there without... without catastrophe. He never said that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2927">Well, mon petit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2928">So next time you'll have your book with you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2929"><em>Yes, I hope so.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2930">No, you must!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2931"><em>I've been floundering.... But you know, for years I've had the intuition, the premonition, that 1963 would be a terrible year ‚Äì personally.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2932">Sixty-three.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2933"><em>Personally, because every ten years ('43, '53...) something catastrophic has happened to me.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2934">The qualifier<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="221" href="#">5</a> we use depends on our limited individual vision,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 428</p>
<p class="PE"> but the fact in itself is probably quite correct: there will be a serious upheaval. But this doesn't mean it will be catastrophic. You see, it may be precisely the opening to something higher, and a new birth to Truth. Personally, I am certain of a very rapid progress <span class="note_0">[for you]</span>, because I see it. But I don't see any personal catastrophes. I haven't seen that at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2935">Unless.... Once, you know, when Sri Aurobindo was still here, I saw.... But it was just a vision, and lots of visions come (this was especially true at that time) as possibilities formed in a given world and descending towards the terrestrial manifestation. They come for me to give them the support of my consent, if I find them interesting. So there are all kinds of things! And most of them get sorted out at that point. But anyway, I had a vision in which Pondicherry was completely engulfed by a bomb (in those days there weren't such powerful bombs ‚Äì so the vision was partly premonitory). So if that happens!... <em>(Mother laughs)</em> As a result of the bombing, I was trapped in a radioactive area (it had been buried underground but not flattened ‚Äì a kind of cave had been formed), where I stayed for two thousand years.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2936">I woke up after two thousand years with a rejuvenated body. It was a very amusing little story.... And I say ‚Äúvision,‚Äù but you don't watch these things like a movie: you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">LIVE</span> them. I somehow extricated myself from that sort of sealed grotto, and where Pondicherry had once stood (it had been completely razed), I came upon some people working.... They were <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY DIFFERENT</span>, and quite bizarre. I myself must have looked funny, with a kind of costume totally alien to their epoch. (My clothing had also survived the destruction ‚Äì the whole thing was right out of a storybook!) So of course I attracted some curiosity and they tried to make me understand. ‚ÄúAh, yes ‚Äì I know...‚Äù one of them said (I understood them because I could understand their thoughts ‚Äì those two thousand years had enabled me to read people's minds), and they led me to a very old sage, a wise old fellow. I spoke to him and he began leafing through all kinds of books (he had many, many books), and suddenly he exclaimed, ‚ÄúAh, French!‚Äù An ancient language, you see <em>(Mother laughs)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2937">It was very funny. I told the story to Sri Aurobindo, and he had a good laugh.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2967">Everything was like that, and without thought ‚Äì I am now trying to put it into words. And at the center of that immensity was a concentration of white light as we know it (far more intense), but denser, forming a sort of cube that was relatively tiny in the immensity, but nonetheless quite perceptible.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2968">In order to be discernible, the cube was enveloped in something that looked like a kind of tulle, a tulle made of a pale gray substance, which expressed the individual nonexistence, the perfect humility that completely abolishes the ego: because of that there wasn't the least possibility of ego ‚Äì if you ask me why, I can't say, but that's how it was. And I was seeing that tulle all the time ‚Äì something extremely delicate, scarcely perceptible, yet maintaining the cube's form. It was perfect humility (in the divine sense) and total absence of ego ‚Äì there wasn't even the memory or idea of it, nothing whatever: the abolition of the ego.

I don't know; the cube represented my physical being: I had been <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TOLD</span> it was my physical being), and I was watching it without being situated ‚Äì I myself had no precise place but could see and understand the whole thing.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2969">And it was so imperative!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2970">It took me a long while to formulate it. What I am telling you now came gradually, slowly, through a sort of silent revelation. At the moment, it was nothing but <em>Sat</em>, an immobile Existence.</p>

<p class="PE"> I had been forewarned that this time it would be different (besides, I've never had the same experience twice), but this was utterly unexpected ‚Äì it didn't come as a response to a will to know or anything at all. I seemed to be simply faced with a fact: it was shown to me. I was witness to my own experience, that's all. And I was absolutely certain of its meaning ‚Äì as when you <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOW</span> and there's no need to discuss or elaborate or explain: that's how it is. And when it was gone, it was gone suddenly, and nothing remained but a blissful tranquillity, a sort of absolute certainty that things <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ARE</span> like that.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-2972">And the charm, the charm of the substance enveloping the cube was inexpressible! Something... I can't describe.

For example, whenever the body feels ill at ease or something isn't working right, there's always a kind of deep feeling behind that it's just bad habits ‚Äì which are lingering, fading away, losing their force and becoming more and more unreal.

For instance, to know at the exact moment what needs to be done or said, what's going to happen ‚Äì if there's the slightest bit of concern or concentration to know, it doesn't come. But if I am just like that, simply in a kind of inner immobility, then for all the little details of life, I know at the exact moment. What needs to be said comes: you say this. And not like an order from outside: it just comes, there it is. What needs to be said is there, the reply that needs to be sent is there; the person who enters, enters ‚Äì you're not forewarned.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3000">A whole world....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3001">One day, I don't remember on what occasion, I saw what had motivated the ‚Äúforefathers‚Äù who wrote the Vedas: it was the need for immortality; they were in quest of immortality.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="229" href="#">6</a> From there, I went on to Buddha and saw what had set the Buddha on his way: this kind of need for permanence, purely and simply; the vision of the impermanence of things had profoundly troubled him, and he felt the need for Permanence. His whole quest was to find the Permanent (why was he so anxious to have the Permanent?...). There are a few things like that in human nature, in the deep human need. And then I saw another such need: a need for the Certitude which is security. I don't know how to explain it.... Because I had the experience of it, I saw it was one of the human needs; and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 437</p>
<p class="PE"> I understood it very intensely, for when I met Sri Aurobindo, this Certitude is what made me feel I had found the Truth I needed. And I didn't realize how <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DEEP</span> this need was until he left his body ‚Äì just then, at the moment of the transition. Then the entire physical consciousness felt its certitude and security collapse. At that moment I saw (we spoke about it with Nolini a year later and he had had exactly the same impression), I saw this was similar to Buddha's experience when he realized that everything was impermanent and so all of life collapsed... in other words, Something Else <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">HAD</span> to be found. Well, at that moment.... I'd already had all my experiences, but with Sri Aurobindo, for the thirty years I lived with him (a little more than thirty years), I lived in an absolute, an absolute of security ‚Äì a sense of total security, even physical, even the most material security. A sense of absolute security, because Sri Aurobindo was there. And it held me up, you know, like this <em>(gesture of being carried)</em>: not for <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE MINUTE</span> in those thirty years did it leave me. That was why I could do my work with a Base, really, a Base of absoluteness ‚Äì of eternity and absoluteness. I realized it when he left: <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT</span> suddenly collapsed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3002">And then I understood that it is one of life's needs (there are several); and it's what spurs the human being to get out of his present state and find another one. These needs are (what's the word?)... the seeds, the germs of evolution. They compel us to progress. The whole time Sri Aurobindo was here, as I said, individual progress was automatic: all the progress Sri Aurobindo made, I made. But I was in a state of eternity, of absoluteness, with a feeling of such security, in every circumstance. Nothing, nothing unfortunate could happen, for he was there. So when he left, all at once ‚Äì a fall into a pit. And that's what projected me wholly... <em>(Mother gestures forward)</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3003">That is, I understood why he left. The whole terrestrial evolution had come to a halt. One progressed ‚Äì one can always progress, that's nothing ‚Äì but the entire <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">TERRESTRIAL</span> evolution was at a standstill. If there were permanence in life, nothing would budge. And these needs are the seeds of evolution. So that's what I saw: in the past, in the future, universally. It was very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3004">And with no effort, no tension, no... as if they were the most natural things in the world. Things like this happen all the time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3005">As soon as I saw that I understood. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù I told myself, ‚Äúif I were a philosopher I could write a thick book about this!‚Äù It made me laugh.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3050">This body is very conscious, it was <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BORN</span> conscious, and throughout those years its consciousness went on growing, perfecting itself, proliferating, as it were; this was its concern, its joy. And with Sri Aurobindo, there was such peaceful certitude, there were no more problems, no more difficulties: the future was opening up, luminous and peaceful and certain. Nothing, nothing, no words can describe what a collapse it was for the body when Sri Aurobindo left.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3051">It's only because Sri Aurobindo's conscious will entered into it ‚Äì left one body and entered the other.... I was standing facing</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3055">What he is now striving to give this body is the consciousness of Permanence, of Immortality, of the Certitude of absolute security ‚Äì in Matter, in Life, in every moment's action. And that is becoming nearer and nearer, more and more constant. Gradually, the mixture of old impressions is disappearing ‚Äì that's the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BEDROCK</span>, the basis of the transformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3056">In the true movement, you feel the Absolute and Eternity physically. How?... It's impossible to describe, but that's how it is. And the minute you get out of That, when you fall back even slightly into the ordinary movement, the old movement, there's a feeling of <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ABSOLUTE</span> uncertainty! Uncertainty at every second. It would be impossible for an ordinary human being to live in that consciousness, with that sense of total and absolute uncertainty, of total and absolute impermanence ‚Äì it's no longer a destruction,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="232" href="#">1</a> but it's not yet an ascending transformation. Absolute instability. It doesn't last more than a fraction of a second ‚Äì just enough time to become aware of oneself, that's all.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3058">The quality of those two vibrations (which are still superimposed, so one can be aware of them both) is indescribable. One is a kind of fragmentation, an infinite fragmentation and absolute instability: like a powdery cloud of atoms in ceaseless movement; and the other is eternal immobility, just as I described it the other day: an infinite Immensity of absolute Light.</p>

And the body, which has reopened the doors it had closed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="233" href="#">2</a> to be able to go on, feels an increasingly total and unmixed identity, to the point where, if I give my hand free rein, my handwriting begins to resemble Sri Aurobindo's ‚Äì tiny, like his.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3062">And it's not what one might imagine, it's not one form entering another ‚Äì it doesn't keep him from being wherever he wants to be and doing whatever he wants to do, appearing as he wants to appear and being involved with everything happening on earth: it doesn't change any of that. And it's not just a part of him... <span class="note_0">[that is in Mother, but his totality]</span>. And that's how I know he was manifesting the Absolute, he was a manifestation of the Absolute. Of course, afterwards he revealed himself as what I had called ‚Äúthe Master of Yoga‚Äù; that was the reason he came on earth (what people here in India call an Avatar). But that's still a way of seeing things <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">SEPARATELY</span>: it's not the thing ‚Äì <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THE</span> thing.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3158">But to me this seems to come from his Jewish background.

He never spoke of it and he had changed his name. They said he was of Jewish origin, but they could never say whether he was Polish or Russian. At least the person who told me never knew. But for the Jews it's the ‚ÄúUnthinkable,‚Äù whose name must not be uttered (it is uttered only once a year, on the ‚ÄúDay of Atonement‚Äù; I think that's what it's called). It's the word <em>Yahveh</em>, and it must not be uttered. But the prayers speak of the ‚ÄúElohim,‚Äù and the Hebrew word ‚ÄúElohim‚Äù is plural, meaning ‚Äúthe invisible lords.‚Äù So there was no one and only God for Th√©on, only the unthinkable Formless; and all the invisible beings who claimed to be one and only gods were Asuras.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3160"><em>I'm going to read it.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3163"><em>(Laughter)</em> It's very meager.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3164">It was obviously a tool for demolishing old notions. It's the idea that man is divine, that he can become divine again through evolution: he was originally immortal and is to be immortal again.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3170">Oh, I understand! Because it's true, you know, that an Asura is behind it all ‚Äì not Christ! Sri Aurobindo considered Christ an Avatar (a minor form of Avatar). One emanation of the Divine's aspect of Love, he always said. But what people have made of him!... Besides, the religion was founded two hundred years after his death. And it's nothing but a political construction, a tool for domination, built with the Lord of Falsehood in the background, who, in his usual fashion, took something true and twisted it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3171">It's a real hodgepodge, that religion ‚Äì the number of sects! The only common ground is the divinity of Christ, and it became asuric when he was made out to be unique: there has been but <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ONE</span> incarnation, Christ. That's just where it all went wrong.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3172">We'll see.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3175">Oh, if you mean the puritans, the Protestants... dreadful! They're the worst. Catholicism still retains something of the occult sense, and after all, they have a certain adoration for the Virgin, which keeps them in contact with something that's not asuric.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3176">The last Pope, who's dead now <span class="note_0">[Pius XII]</span>, had broadened both his own mind and Church doctrine a lot: he was a devotee of the Virgin.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3177">But the Protestants turned back to the Father, and so their worship became exactly the worship of a one and only, personal God, an asuric God. And they have fabricated and distorted everything: like asceticism, for instance, and all that sort of thing ‚Äì everything they touched was twisted and spoiled.</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(A few days earlier, Mother inaugurated the new music room built on the terrace near her room. Without informing her, the disciples had also built a balcony, in the hope that Mother would start giving ‚Äúmorning darshans‚Äù again, as she used to in the past.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3179">How are you feeling? Better or not?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3180"><em>Inwardly, yes, I'm all right.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3181">Because the series continues; I mean everything everywhere seems to want to disintegrate: everything everywhere. But the Power is beginning to have an effect (that's putting it poorly, it's not exactly that...). It's as though I were presented with every possible opportunity to use the Power and they're not coming one</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 458</p>
<p class="PE"> after the other but all at once, almost like a lesson ‚Äì in fact, to teach me how to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3182">I have to admit that it always ends well, in that the Power always gets the upper hand, but it's so (what's the word?)... so repetitious, many-sided and coexistent that, you know, it feels a bit like charging along at a gallop for hours on end.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3183">But I had an interesting experience the other day, when this new room was inaugurated. Those rascals set up a balcony! And there was such a crowd ‚Äì in all the streets, on the rooftops ‚Äì that I had no choice but to go out on the balcony.... And I realized that there has been a complete break between my life before and now, with that famous experience<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="236" href="#">1</a> as the dividing line: I have to make the same movement I make to summon up the memory of a past life! It was so concrete, I was flabbergasted. The same movement of consciousness as when you summon up a past life: it was as though I had to recall what I used to do on the balcony in my former life! I was teaching the body as if it had no idea what to do. I was calling back what had to be done from the depths of a subconscious memory. But it was not the same thing, since the doors were not the same, the setup was different, so it was a little bit complicated. But when I found myself at the edge of the balcony, I suddenly drew on something, and this came: ‚ÄúHere's how it was, here's what I used to do‚Äù; and once again the Presence was there. And the whole time I was standing on the balcony it was... it was better than before, much clearer ‚Äì much clearer ‚Äì the experiences are much simpler and much more absolute (when I know something, I know it better than before).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3184">But in the past, you see, I used to go up and down the stairs four or five times a day; I would go out, go down the other stairs, it gave me some exercise. Nowadays I don't get any exercise, except walking for half an hour twice a day, but that's no substitute: my legs are a bit stiff from lack of exercise. So I didn't feel like walking on the balcony like a puppet before of all those people waiting and wondering.... You see, more than three-quarters of them think I was very sick <em>(Mother laughs)</em>, practically dying (that's the form it takes in their consciousness). I couldn't show them someone who seemed to be ‚Äúemerging from a serious illness‚Äù! So I clearly saw I had to tell my body, ‚ÄúNow don't walk like that! You've got to walk like this ‚Äì this is how you used to walk.‚Äù And the body was listening like a little child. ‚ÄúYou're going to walk,‚Äù I</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 459</p>
<p class="PE"> had to tell it, ‚Äúyou're going to walk like this.‚Äù And it started walking!... It was funny.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3185"><em>(Mother hands a box to Satprem)</em> F. and R. have come and she brought me some candied chestnuts from Paris....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3186"><em>Oh, these are delicious.... Did you find any difference in people's atmosphere?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3187">They were slightly more aware of what it meant, that's all. But that's something they learned when I left ‚Äì it's always necessary to make people understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3188"><em>Will you do it again?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3189">Later.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3190">It was... difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3191">It was difficult and it attracts a lot of.... It's like another type of exercise, as if my body were now being taught other kinds of things, another way of being, you understand, another way. And it's trying to find a harmony, the equilibrium of a constant harmony. But it's very, very, very difficult. It's not at all the usual condition: in ordinary life, the cells are accustomed to a very restless and unexpected life, with ups and downs, peaks of intense sensation, now sorrow, now pleasure, now acute pain, now something very pleasant ‚Äì all of this jumbled up in a sort of chaos. And I have realized that for the people here, even those near me, it's even worse than that! This doesn't make sense to me any more. On its own the body is naturally in a sort of gently undulating movement, a very harmonious, very peaceful, very quiet movement. And when it's not forced into outer activity there's such a wonderful sense of the divine Presence everywhere, everywhere ‚Äì in it, around it, over it, in everything, everywhere... and so concrete! <em>(Mother touches her hands, her arms, her face, as if she were bathing in the Lord.)</em> It's really inexpressible. And well, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">THAT'S</span> what it wants to have <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">ALL THE TIME</span>, in all circumstances, even when it's forced to have contacts with the outside. So I can't go too quickly; things like the balcony cause a bit too much pressure, and the body starts feeling a little unsure of itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3192">Yesterday, for instance, I had to see F. and R., since they had just arrived the day before. I spent three-quarters of an hour with them, and by the time it was over they had literally <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EMPTIED</span> the atmosphere of all spiritual sense ‚Äì it had become empty and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 460</p>
<p class="PE"> hollow. It took me two or three minutes of concentration (which isn't so long) to bring it all back to normal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3193">I haven't seen much of that room,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="237" href="#">2</a> I haven't been there often. I went to see what it was like for the first time the evening before the inauguration, and it gave me the feeling of something totally empty ‚Äì you know, hollow and dry. It was so strong that the body felt like this <em>(wavering gesture, as if Mother were losing her footing)</em>. That's how the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">BODY</span> felt, it's not the consciousness; I am talking about the body-consciousness. The room seemed so hollow and empty that the body felt drained, as if all its force and consciousness had to spread out everywhere in order to fill up that emptiness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3194">The next day it wasn't like that any more; the work had been done the day before, in one minute (it gets done very quickly, but in a very intense and violent way). I had purposely gone to the room the previous evening, to set things in order, and so the next day it was better, the work was already done. Then I sat down at the organ... it was much better than I expected. It was as if a formation were waiting, and as soon as I sat down it descended. Oh, a marvelous musical joy! I didn't have to look ‚Äì and when I wasn't looking, I saw everything from within: all the notes, my hands, everything, with eyes closed. And so it descended... I was very happy. I must have played for a good twenty minutes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3195">After twenty minutes, something said, ‚ÄúThat's enough.‚Äù And I saw that it was enough for the body, that it shouldn't exert itself further ‚Äì the formation withdrew. I couldn't have played a single note more!... It was very interesting. And I realized that, truly, the will that moves my body isn't at all the same as before. Previously, it was the will of the being that had been placed into and formed in this body (it wasn't personal but still very individual). While now it's not that: it's a Will somewhere (somewhere which is everywhere and in everything), a Will somewhere that decides, and when it says ‚ÄúDo,‚Äù the body does; when it says ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù nothing in the world could make the body move. And so, that conscious ‚Äúsomething‚Äù somewhere, which is like an intermediary between the higher Will and the body and its outer life, has to tell the body, ‚ÄúThis is necessary.‚Äù The body never protests, because that which speaks knows <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY WELL</span>. It says, ‚ÄúThis is necessary,‚Äù all right, the body does it. But when it says, ‚ÄúThat's enough, now,‚Äù the body stops. Because (how can I express</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 461</p>
<p class="PE"> it?)... <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">FOR THE BODY</span>, the Most High knows better than the intermediary. In regard to circumstances and the vision of the work to be done, it's all one; but for taking care of and educating the body, That <em>(gesture on high)</em> knows best. The intermediary doesn't really care (!), but when That says ‚Äúdo,‚Äù it's done; ‚Äúfinished,‚Äù and it's finished. It's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3196">Naturally, the whole crowd and the people around me kept asking, ‚ÄúNow that it's all set up, when will there be balcony darshans again?‚Äù (Because when I came back inside I said, ‚ÄúSo! You've built a balcony, have you?‚Äù). ‚ÄúWhen are we going to have them again?‚Äù So the intermediary said, ‚ÄúI don't know, it's not up to me.‚Äù Consternation! Then I kept very quiet for a little while, listening on high, and from high, high up there came, very slowly (it comes practically drop by drop because you have to do it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> quietly ‚Äì it comes drop by drop), what That said I had to reply: ‚ÄúNothing definite.‚Äù I was told, ‚ÄúIt depends.‚Äù It all depends ‚Äì I clearly see that it all depends on the special work being done on my body and on the results of that work. And it isn't formulated: I am not told, I am not told what's going to happen; I am only told, ‚ÄúHere's how it might be.‚Äù <em>(Mother laughs)</em> All right. ‚ÄúThat's fine,‚Äù I said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3197">But it was funny; it was really an experience, because had you asked me my impression beforehand (‚Äúmy,‚Äù I mean what usually talks), my impression was that I just had to decide to go to the balcony and it would happen (the only impossibility I saw was finding time for it). But that's not how it is, that's not it <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">AT ALL</span>. It's something else, utterly new, something I don't know; I have absolutely no reference points, and... decisions are made on the highest level ‚Äì only with regard to the body. I mean for the work in general, for the terrestrial vision and all that, there's no difference: it's seen, it's known. But for this special thing in the body, I am not consulted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3198">I was really amused.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3199">Well now, have you brought your book?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3200">Read.</p>
<p class="Ps">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 462</p>
<p class="PE"><em>After Satprem has read from his manuscript:</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3201">It's very good, very good, excellent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3202">It's just the impression I have now: what's happening is something that has never happened before, and consequently, <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">NOBODY</span> can understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3203">For instance, those who witness the phenomenon on a day-to-day basis (such as the doctor, for example) say, ‚ÄúI don't understand. Oh, is that how it is? I don't understand. Yes, of course, there are certain reasons....‚Äù When something happens, I ask him, ‚ÄúHow do you account for this?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don't know.‚Äù But if I tell him, ‚ÄúWell, I think I know what it depends on,‚Äù he stares at me as if to say, ‚ÄúBats in her belfry!‚Äù So I don't say anything. I tried two or three times, just to see ‚Äì there's no reaction, nobody understands, nobody!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3204">Even if I speak to someone more intelligent or better informed.... Once or twice I said something to Pavitra, to see what would happen: he immediately dogmatizes, makes a mental principle out of it (consistent with Sri Aurobindo's teaching, of course!). And it becomes something rigid, like a box. And he tries! He tries, he <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">KNOWS</span> he shouldn't do that, but.... Which means one cannot understand unless one has the experience ‚Äì you must have the experience of all this somewhere, mon petit, otherwise you couldn't write about it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3205"><em>But it's Sri Aurobindo!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3206">And interestingly enough, as I told you last time, it follows my body's experience quite closely and regularly. There are so many sides to the problem, you see, so many ways of approaching the problem and attempting the transformation, and it <span class="note_0">[the book]</span> seems to follow very, very well.... It's interesting. Your book, and also my translation ‚Äì and yet they are so different! But of course, the experience itself is very, very diverse, multifaceted, with all sorts of side roads or forks, tiny little signs on the way, simply as clues ‚Äì a whole world!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3207">And I see clearly that trying to formulate it would spoil everything. You really can't formulate a curve until you come to the end of it ‚Äì otherwise, you spoil its course.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3208">But it's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3209">Well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3210">Au revoir, mon petit; it's good ‚Äì it's going well. That's what Sri Aurobindo told me a few days ago (I spent two hours with him</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 463</p>
<p class="PE"> at night, with all sorts of very interesting things happening). He told me (in his joking way), ‚ÄúYou see! I've got him doing the book that makes him progress.‚Äù So I said, ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù Because he has been there all along since you embarked on this book, and he seems to be guiding you according to a plan he has worked out. That's what he told me. I have seen him with you very frequently (as I've told you), but the other day he told me this positively.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3220">In the end, Sri Aurobindo told me it was an overmental creation, not the Truth. These were his very words: ‚ÄúYes, it's an overmental</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 464</p>
<p class="PE"> creation, but that's not the truth we're seeking; it's not the truth, <em>the highest truth</em>,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3221">I made no reply, not a word: in half an hour I had undone everything ‚Äì I undid it all, really everything, cut the connection between the gods and the people here, demolished absolutely everything. Because you see, I knew it was so attractive for people (they were constantly seeing the most astonishing things) that the obvious temptation was to hang on to it and say, ‚ÄúWe'll improve on it‚Äù ‚Äì which was impossible. So I sat down quietly for half an hour, and I undid it all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3222">We had to start over again with something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3223">But I said nothing, I told no one about it except Sri Aurobindo. At the time I let no one know, because they would have been completely discouraged.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3226">If I spent the whole night writing, as Sri Aurobindo used to do, I might be able to keep up to date. But I have no intention of doing that, because my nights are very interesting!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3227">I have had... some rather strange things have been happening. I don't know whether you understand the difference between the memory of an inner experience (from the subtle physical, the subconscient, all the inner regions) and the memory of a physical fact. There is a very great difference in quality, the same difference that exists between inner vision and physical vision. Physical vision is precise, well defined, and at the same time flat ‚Äì I don't know how to explain it: it's very flat, totally superficial, but very accurate, with the kind of accuracy and precision that defines things which are really not defined at all. Well, there's the same difference in quality between the two types of memory as between the two types of vision. And in the last few days I've realized that I had the memory of having gone downstairs, of having seen certain people and things, spoken and organized certain things ‚Äì several different scenes... of the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">PHYSICAL</span> memory. Not at all things I saw with the inner vision while exteriorized, but the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">MATERIAL</span> memory of having done certain things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3228">Afterwards, I had to look into it: it really was a memory. It suddenly struck me, and I wondered, ‚ÄúDid I really go downstairs</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 465</p>
<p class="PE"> physically?‚Äù... There are plenty of people here to prove that I didn't, that I didn't stir from here. And yet I have the physical memory of having done so, and of having done certain other things as well; I even remember going outside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3229">Well, it confronts me with a real problem. Not only is that memory absolutely physical, but the <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">EFFECTS</span> of what I said and did are there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3230"><em>The effects are there?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3231">Yes, they are. Tiny things, certain arrangements in a room, slight changes in regard to the meals, things of absolutely no importance in themselves ‚Äì the little things life is full of, the things one does all the time, not big events (I know there's also an action on terrestrial events and all that, but it belongs to the other type of memory).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3232"><em>You've been able to verify these changes?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3233">There's no question of verification ‚Äì they happened!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3234"><em>Oh, they happened!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3235">‚ÄúHere's how this should be,‚Äù I would say, and it became like that. For example, if I told someone to put something in a certain place, he did it. The person doesn't know I told him, because he's not in the same consciousness as I am, but he did it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3236">And I found out about the immediate effects of it even before recalling it, for it all unfolded in reverse: when a certain thing was done, I thought, ‚ÄúWhat on earth! This person is wonderful.‚Äù And then I suddenly realized, ‚ÄúBut I told him to do that!‚Äù I told him. Then the image came ‚Äì ‚Äúthe image‚Äù... I don't mean the sort of memory one has of a vision, but the memory of something one has <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">DONE</span>. With that kind of image, it's not that you ‚Äúlook‚Äù: it just enters into you quite naturally. It has a particular quality. That's how I became aware of these changes. I noticed them on my own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3237">And they are facts. There's nothing to discuss: they are facts. And yet materially, according to physical appearances, that is, I didn't stir from here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3238">So <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">WHO</span> was it, who did all that? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3239"><em>Could it be some exteriorization in the subtle physical?</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 466</p>
<p class="PE"> Not at all! The memory of an exteriorization in the subtle physical is <span class="D_BIG_LETTERS">VERY</span> different. I have a lot of experience of it, you know! I have been familiar with the phenomenon for something like sixty years ‚Äì it's completely different. But this is entirely the type of experience one has in the physical Falsehood, if you will, in the ordinary physical consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3240">I haven't said anything because people here tend to think I am going off my rocker, and I don't want to add to their... impression! But even for me, it left me... it took me a little while (it didn't happen just once, but two or three times, for different things), I kept very still for a while to look into the phenomenon and try to analyze it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3241">But I haven't yet found the key.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3242"><em>A kind of material doubling?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3243">Possibly. It may be that.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3246">When experiences happen to other people (they have no knowledge ‚Äì ignorance is the most widespread thing), they take them all for dreams.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3248">According to what we know, yes, it might be what's called a phenomenon of ubiquity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3249">But for instance, if this had happened with people who know nothing of my outer life, they would have said, ‚ÄúBut Mother went outside, I saw her.‚Äù I had experiences like that in Paris (it happened to someone else, not me personally). Someone swore that another person (who, by the way, was with me at the time) had come to him, spoken to him and even clapped him on the shoulder ‚Äì all the typical phenomena of ubiquity which in this case were explained by mental concentration. But this person had no idea that it was impossible (according to material logic) for the other one to have come to him, you see. So he quite simply and naturally said, ‚ÄúBut look, I saw him, I spoke to him, he clapped me on the shoulder!‚Äù</p>

<p class="Ps"><em>(Satprem reads Mother one last passage from his manuscript:)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3287">Evolution does not move higher and higher, into an ever more heavenly heaven, but deeper and deeper; and each cycle or evolutionary round comes to completion a little further down, a little nearer the Center where the Supreme High and Low, heaven and earth, will finally join. Thus for the two poles</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 470</p>
<p class="PE"> to actually meet, the pioneer must cleanse the mental, vital, and material middle ground. When the junction is made, not merely mentally and vitally but materially, Spirit will emerge in Matter, in a total supramental being and supramental body, and...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV3-3289">This cleansing of the middle ground is the whole story of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother... ‚ÄúI had been dredging, dredging, dredging the mire of the subconscious.... The supramental light was coming down before November,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="241" href="#">2</a> but afterwards all the mud arose and it stopped.‚Äù<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="242" href="#">3</a> Once again Sri Aurobindo verified, not individually this time but collectively, that if one pulls down too strong a light, the violated darkness below is made to moan. It is noteworthy that each time Sri Aurobindo and the Mother had some new experience marking a progress in the transformation, this progress automatically materialized in the consciousness of the disciples, without their even knowing anything about it, as a period of increased difficulties, sometimes even revolts or illnesses, as though everything were grating and grinding. But then, one begins to understand the mechanism. If a pygmy were abruptly subjected to the simple mental light of a cultivated man, we would probably see the poor fellow traumatized and driven mad by the subterranean revolutions within him. There is still too much jungle beneath the surface. The world is still full of jungle, that's the crux of the matter in a word; our mental colonization is a minuscule crust plastered over a barely dry quaternary.... And the battle seems endless; one ‚Äúdigs and digs,‚Äù said the Rishis, and the deeper one digs, the more the bottom seems to recede: ‚ÄúI have been digging, digging.... Many autumns have I been toiling night and day, the dawns aging me. Age is diminishing the glory of our bodies.‚Äù Thus, thousands of years ago, lamented Lopamudra, wife of Rishi Agastya, who was also seeking transformation.... But Agastya doesn't lose heart, and his reply is magnificently characteristic of the conquerors the Rishis were: ‚ÄúNot in vain</p>
