<p class="p-num">Page 8</p>
<p class="PE">High were her bannered edifices reared,<br/>

		High circling all<br/>
		The city with disastrous engines stored<br/>
		In hundreds, the great ramparts like a zone<br/>

		Defiant<br/>
		Ayodhya stood, armèd, impregnable,<br/>
		Inviolable in her virgin walls.<br/>
		And in her streets was ever large turmoil,<br/>
		Passing of elephants, the steed and ox,<br/>

		And through them drove<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="T-5">“Hadst thou been never born, Rama, my son,<br/>
		Born for my grief, I had not felt such pain,<br/>
		A childless woman.
		For the barren one<br/>
		Grief of the heart companions, only one,<br/>
		Complaining, ‘I am barren’; this she mourns,<br/>
		She has no cause for any deeper tears.<br/>
		But I am inexperienced in delight<br/>
		And never of my husband’s masculine love<br/>
		Had pleasure,– still I lingered, still endured<br/>
		Hoping to be acquainted yet with joy.<br/>
		Therefore full many unlovely words that strove<br/>
		To break the suffering heart had I to hear<br/>
		From wives of my husband, I the Queen and highest,<br/>
		From lesser women.
		Ah what greater pain<br/>
		Than this can women have who mourn on earth,<br/>
		Than this my grief and infinite lament?<br/>
		O Rama, even at thy side so much<br/>
		I have endured, and if thou goest hence,<br/>
		Death is my certain prospect, death alone.<br/>
		Cruelly neglected, grievously oppressed<br/>
		I have lived slighted in my husband’s house<br/>
		As though Kaicayie’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7" href="#">1</a> serving-woman,– nay,<br/>
		A lesser thing than these.
		If any honours,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="PE">If any follows me, even that man<br/>
		Hushes when he beholds Kaicayie’s son.<br/>
		How shall I in my misery endure<br/>
		That bitter mouth intolerable, bear<br/>
		Her ceaseless petulance.
		O<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="8" href="#">2</a> I have lived<br/>
		Seventeen years since thou wast born, my son,<br/>
		O Rama, seventeen long years have lived<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="9" href="#">3</a>,<br/>
		Wearily wishing for an end to grief;<br/>
		And now this mighty anguish without end!<br/>
		I have no strength to bear for ever pain;<br/>
		Nor this worn heart with suffering fatigued<br/>
		To satisfy the scorn of rivals yields<br/>
		More tears.
		Ah how shall I without thy face<br/>
		Miserably exist, without thy face,<br/>
		My moon of beauty, miserable days?<br/>
		Me wretched, who
		with fasts and weary toils<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="10" href="#">4</a><br/>
		And dedicated musings reared thee up,<br/>
		Vainly.
		Alas, the river’s giant banks,<br/>
		How great they are! and yet when violent rain<br/>
		Has levelled their tops with water, they descend<br/>
		In ruin, not like this heart which will not break.<br/>
		But I perceive death was not made for me,<br/>
		For me no room in those stupendous realms<br/>
		Has been discovered; since not even today<br/>
		As on a mourning hind the lion falls<br/>
		Death seizes me or to his thicket bears<br/>
		With his huge leap,– death, ender of all pain.<br/>
		How livest thou, O hard, O iron heart,<br/>
		Unbroken?
		O body, tortured by such grief,<br/>
		How sinkst thou not all shattered to the earth?<br/>
		Therefore I know death comes not called – he waits<br/>
		Inexorably his time.
		But this I mourn,<br/>
		My useless vows, gifts, offerings, self-control,<br/>
		And dire ascetic strenuousness perfected<br/>
		In passion for a son,– yet all like seed<br/>
		Fruitless and given to ungrateful soil.<br/>
		But if death came before his season, if one</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 11</p>
<p class="PE">By anguish of unbearable heavy grief<br/>
		Naturally might win him, then today<br/>
		Would I have hurried to his distant worlds<br/>
		Of thee deprived, O Rama, O my son.<br/>
		Why should I vainly live without thine eyes,<br/>
		Thou moonlight of my soul?
		No, let me toil<br/>
		After thee to the savage woods where thou<br/>
		Must harbour; I will trail these feeble limbs<br/>
		Behind thy steps as<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11" href="#">5</a> the sick yearning dam<br/>
		That follows still her ravished young.”
		Thus she<br/>
		Yearning upon her own beloved son; –<br/>
		As over her offspring chained a Centauress<br/>
		Impatient of her anguish deep, so wailed<br/>
		Cowshalya; for her heart with grief was loud.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="T-6">But Sita all the while, unhappy child,<br/>
		Worshipped propitious gods.
		Her mind in dreams<br/>
		August and splendid coronations dwelt<br/>
		And knew not of that woe.

		A princess in her mind and mood, and sat<br/>
		With expectation thrilled.
		To whom there came<br/>

		Dark with thought and shaken<br/>

		She started from her seat, transfixed, and trembled,<br/>
		For all the beauty of his face was marred,<br/>
		Who when he saw his young beloved wife<br/>
		Endured no longer; all his inner passion<br/>
		Of tortured pride was opened in his face.<br/>

<p class="PE">When Jupiter, the imperial planet, joins<br/>

		Thy crowning where?
		No foam-white softness silk<br/>
		With hundred-shafted canopy o’erhues<br/>
		Thy kingly head, no fans o’erwave thy face<br/>
		Like birds that beat their bright wings near a flower;<br/>
		Minstrel nor orator attends thy steps<br/>
		To hymn thy greatness, nor are heralds heard<br/>
		Voicing high stanzas.
		Who has then forbade<br/>
		The honeyed curds that Brahmins Veda-wise<br/>
		Should pour on thy anointed brow,– the throngs<br/>
		That should behind thee in a glory surge,–<br/>
		The ministers and leading citizens<br/>
		And peers and commons of the provinces<br/>
		And commons metropolitan?
		Where stays<br/>
		Thy chariot by four gold-clad horses drawn,<br/>
		Trampling, magnificent, wide-maned? thy huge<br/>
		High-omened elephant, a thunder-cloud<br/>
		Or moving mountain in thy front? thy seat<br/>
		Enriched with curious gold?
		Such are the high<br/>
		Symbols men lead before anointed kings<br/>
		Through streets flower-crowned.

		Then answered her the hope of Raghou’s line,<br/>
		“Sita, my sire exiles me to the woods.<br/>

		And all the moonbright<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24" href="#">13</a> glories of her face<br/>

		To the drear wilderness I go.<br/>

		This all bliss brings,<br/>
		Compels all gifts, compels harvests and wealth,<br/>
		Knowledge compels and children.
		All these joys,<br/>
		These<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="26" href="#">15</a> human boons great filial souls on earth<br/>
		Recovering here enjoy and in that world<br/>
		Heaven naturally is theirs.
		But me whatever,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="PE">In the strict path of virtue while he stands,<br/>
		My father bids, my heart bids that.
		I go,<br/>
		But not alone, o’ercome by thy sweet soul’s<br/>
		High courage.
		O intoxicating eyes,<br/>
		O faultless limbs, go with me, justify<br/>
		The wife’s proud name, partner in virtue.
		Love,<br/>
		Warm from thy great, highblooded lineage old<br/>
		Thy purpose springing mates with the pure strain<br/>
		Of Raghou’s ancient house.
		O let thy large<br/>
		And lovely motion forestward make speed<br/>
		High ceremonies to absolve.
		Heaven’s joys<br/>
		Without thee now were beggarly and rude.<br/>
		Haste then, the Brahmin and the pauper feed<br/>
		And to their blessings answer jewels.
		All<br/>
		Our priceless diamonds and our splendid robes,<br/>

		The glory and the eye’s delight, do them<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="27" href="#">16</a><br/>
		Renounce, nor let our faithful servants lose<br/>
		Their worthy portion.”
		Sita of that consent<br/>
		So hardly won sprang joyous, as on fire,<br/>
		Disburdened of her wealth, lightly to wing<br/>
		Into dim wood and wilderness unknown.</p>

		There he and Lakshmana following him saw a desolation in the midmost of that wood, for blasted were tree and

		And walking with Sita there Cacootstha in that haunt of fierce wild beasts beheld the appearance like a mountain

		Three lions, four tigers, two wolves, ten spotted deer and the huge fat-smeared head of an elephant with its

		As soon as he saw Rama and Lakshmana and Sita Mithilan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46" href="#">19</a> he ran upon
		them in sore wrath like Death the ender leaping on the nations, and with a terrible roar that seemed to shake
		the earth he took Vydehie up in his arms and moved away and said, “You who wear<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="47" href="#">20</a> the ascetic’s cloth and matted locks, O ye whose lives are short, yet with a wife have you
		entered Dandak woods and you bear the arrow, sword and bow, how is this that you being anchorites hold your

		Workers of unrighteousness, who are ye, evil men, disgrace to the garb of the seer?
		I Viradha the Rakshasa range armed these tangled woods eating the flesh of the sages.

		The son of Raghu seeing the beautiful Sita in Viradha’s arms said to Lakshmana, his face drying up with grief,
		“Behold, O my brother, the daughter of Janak lord of men, my wife of noble life taken into Viradha’s arms, the
		King’s daughter highsplendoured and nurtured in utter ease!
		The thing Kaikayie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="51" href="#">24</a> desired, the thing dear to her that she chose

		Now today she has her desire, that middle mother of mine.
		For no worse grief can befall me than that another should touch Vydehie and that my father should perish and my
		own kingdom be wrested from my hands.”
		So Cacootstha spake<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="53" href="#">26</a>, and Lakshmana answered him and his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="54" href="#">27</a> eyes filled with the mist<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">28</a> of grief and he panted<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="56" href="#">29</a> like a furious snake

		and declared his birth in Ikshwaku’s line.
		“Kshatriyas accomplished in virtue know us to be, farers in this forest, but of thee we would know who thou art

		High the din of mellay rose<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="64" href="#">4</a>,<br/>
		Giant and Ape<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="65" href="#">5</a> with tree and spear and mace<br/>

		Their dire<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="67" href="#">7</a> opponents down on every side<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="68" href="#">8</a>,<br/>
		And they too with the trunks of trees bore down<br/>
		Their monstrous foes and levelled with the dust.<br/>
		But<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69" href="#">9</a> in their wrath increasing Lanca’s hosts<br/>
		Pierced the invaders; straight their arrows flew<br/>
		Unswerving, fatal, heron-winged; sharp-knobbed<br/>
		Their maces smote and dreadful clubs prevailed;<br/>
		The curious tridents did their work.
		But torn,<br/>
		But mangled by the shafts, but pierced with spears<br/>
		The Apes in act heroic, unalarmed,<br/>
		Drew boldness from impatience of defeat;<br/>
		Trees from the earth they plucked, lifted great rocks<br/>
		And with a dreadful speed, roaring aloud,<br/>
		Hurling their shouted names behind the blow,<br/>
		They slew with these the heroes of the isle.<br/>
		Down fell the Giants crushed and from their mouths<br/>
		Vomited lifeblood, pounded were by rocks<br/>
		And with crushed sides collapsed or by ape-teeth<br/>
		Were mangled, or lay in heaps by trees o’erborne.<br/>
		Some with sad faces tore their locks in grief,<br/>
		Bewildered with the smell of blood and death<br/>
		Some lifeless sank upon the earth.
		Enraged<br/>
		Dhoomraksha saw the rout and forward stormed<br/>
		And made a mighty havoc of the foe,<br/>
		Crushing to earth their bleeding forms with axe</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 28</p>
<p class="PE">And javelin and mace oppressed or torn.<br/>
		Some helpless died, some gave their blood to earth,<br/>
		Some scattering fled the fierce pursuer’s wrath,<br/>
		Some with torn hearts slept on one side relaxed<br/>
		On earth’s soft bosom, some with entrails plucked<br/>
		Out of their bodies by the tridents died<br/>
		Wretchedly.
		Sweet twanged the bowstrings, lyres of war,<br/>
		The sobbing of the warriors’ breath was time<br/>
		And with a thunder dull, battle delivered<br/>
		Its dread orchestral music.
		In the front<br/>
		Of all that war Dhoomraksha thundered armed,<br/>
		Laughing aloud, and with fast-sleeting shafts<br/>
		Scattered to every wind his foes.
		At last<br/>
		The Son of Tempest saw his army’s rout<br/>
		Astonished by Dhoomraksha; wroth he saw<br/>
		And came, carrying a giant crag he came,<br/>
		Red-gazing, and with all his father’s force<br/>
		At dire Dhoomraksha’s chariot hurled.
		Alarmed<br/>
		Dhoomraksha saw the flying boulder come<br/>
		And rearing up his club from the high car<br/>
		He leaped.
		Down crashed the rock and ground the car<br/>
		To pieces, wheel and flag and pole and yoke<br/>
		And the forsaken bow.
		Hanuman too<br/>
		Abandoning his chariot through the ranks<br/>
		Opposing strode with havoc; trees unlopped<br/>
		With all their boughs for mace and club he used.<br/>
		With shattered heads and bodies oozing blood<br/>
		The Giants fell before him.
		Scattering so<br/>
		The Giant army Hanuman, the Wind’s<br/>
		Tremendous son, took easily in his hands<br/>
		A mountain’s mighty top and ran and strode<br/>
		Where stood Dhoomraksha.
		Roaring answer loud<br/>
		The mighty Giant with his club upreared<br/>
		Came furiously to meet the advancing foe.<br/>
		Wrathful the heroes met, and on the head<br/>
		Of Hanuman the weapon many-spiked<br/>
		Of dire Dhoomraksha fell; but he the Ape,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="PE">Strong in inheritance of might divine,<br/>
		Not even heeded such a blow, but brought<br/>
		Right on Dhoomraksha’s crown the summit huge<br/>
		And all his limbs were shattered with the stroke<br/>
		And like a broken mountain they collapsed<br/>
		Earthward, o’erwhelmed, in-smitten, prone.
		The Giants left,<br/>
		Survivors of that slaughter, fled alarmed<br/>
		And entered Lanca by the Apes pursued<br/>
		And butchered as they fled.
		But from that fight<br/>
		Victorious, weary, rested Hanuman<br/>
		Amid his slaughtered foemen and engirt<br/>
		With the red rivers he had made to flow,<br/>
		Praised by the host, rejoicing in his wounds.</p>

		before Krishna’s face to great Urjuun<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-1" href="#">1</a><br/>
		Maia<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-2" href="#">2</a> with clasped hands bending; mild and boon<br/>
		His voice as gratitude’s: “Me the strong ire<br/>
		Had slain of Krishna or the hungry fire<br/>
		Consumed: by thee I live, O Kuuntie’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-3" href="#">3</a> son:<br/>
		What shall I do for thy sake?”
		And Urjuun,<br/>
		“Paid is thy debt.
		Go thou and prosper: love<br/>
		Repays the lover: this our friendship prove.”<br/>
		“Noble thy word and like thyself;” returned<br/>
		The Titan, “yet in me a fire has burned<br/>
		Some deed to do for love’s sake.
		He am I,<br/>
		The Titan architect and poet high,<br/>
		The maker: something give me to create.”<br/>
		Urjuun replied, “If from the grasp of Fate<br/>
		Rescued by me thou pray’st, then is the deed<br/>
		Sufficient, Titan: I will take no meed.<br/>
		Yet will I not deny thee: for my friend<br/>
		Do somewhat and thy debt to me shall end.”<br/>
		Then by the Titan
		questioned Vaasudave<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-4" href="#">4</a><br/>
		Pondered a while<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-5" href="#">5</a> what boon were best to have.<br/>
		At length he answered: “Let a hall be raised<br/>
		Peerless, thou great artificer highpraised,–<br/>
		If thou wilt needs do somewhat high designed,–<br/>
		For Yudishthere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-6" href="#">6</a> such hall as may thy mind<br/>
		Imagine.
		Wonderful the pile shall be,<br/>
		No mortal man shall copy although he</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 34</p>
<p class="PE">Labour to grasp it, nor on transient earth<br/>
		Another equal wonder shall have birth.<br/>
		Vast let it be.
		Let human and divine<br/>
		And the Titanic meet in one design.”<br/>
		Joyful the builder took the word and high<br/>
		The Pandove’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69-7" href="#">7</a> hall he made imperially.<br/>
		But first the heroes to the King repair,<br/>
		Just Yudishthere, and all their story there<br/>
		Tell out: the Titan also they present,<br/>
		Their living proof of great accomplishment.<br/>
		Nobly he welcomed was by that just King.<br/>
		There in high ease, befriended, sojourning<br/>
		The life of elder gods dethroned of old<br/>
		The Titan to the Pandove princes told.<br/>
		Short space for rest took the creative mind<br/>
		And inly planned and mightily designed<br/>
		A hall imperial for those mighty ones.<br/>
		With Krishna then consulting and the sons<br/>
		Of Pritha on a day of sacred light<br/>
		All fate-appeasing ceremonies right<br/>
		He ordered and with rice in sugared milk<br/>
		Sated the priests, silver and herds and silk.<br/>
		In energy of genius next he chose<br/>
		Ten thousand cubits, mapped a mighty close,<br/>
		Region delightful where divinely sweet<br/>
		The joy of all the seasons seemed to meet.<br/>
		Four were the sides, ten thousand cubits all.<br/>
		This was the measure of the Pandove’s hall.<br/>
		But in the Khandav plain abode in ease<br/>
		Junnardun mid the reverent ministries<br/>
		Of the great five: their loves his home renew.<br/>
		But for his father’s sight a yearning grew<br/>
		And drew him thence.
		He of the monarch just<br/>
		And Pritha craved departure.
		In the dust<br/>
		His head he lowered at her worshipped feet,<br/>
		He for the whole world’s homage only meet.<br/>
		Him she embraced and kissed his head.
		Next he</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="PE">His sister dear encountered lovingly.<br/>
		Wet were his eyes as with low words and few<br/>
		Pregnant and happy, admirably true<br/>
		He greeted that divine fair girl and heard<br/>
		Of her sweet eloquence many a tender word<br/>
		That to her kin should travel; reverent<br/>
		She bowed her lovely head.
		And Krishna went<br/>
		To Draupadie and Dhaum and took of these<br/>
		Various farewell,– soft words her heart to ease,<br/>
		But to the priest yielded the man divine<br/>
		Obeisance just and customary sign.<br/>
		Thereafter with Urjuun the hero wise<br/>
		His brothers met and in celestial guise,<br/>
		Like Indra with the great immortals round,<br/>
		All rites that to safe journeying redound<br/>
		Performing, bath and pure ablution made<br/>
		And worship due with salutation paid,<br/>
		Garlanded, praying, in rich gems arrayed,<br/>
		All incenses that breathe beneath the sun<br/>
		To gods and Brahmans offered.
		These things done<br/>
		Departure now was next.
		Stately he came<br/>
		Outward and all of venerable name<br/>
		Who bore the sacred office, had delight<br/>
		Of fruit and grain yet in the husk and white<br/>
		Approvèd curds, much wealth; and last the ground<br/>
		He trod and traced the gyre of blessing round.<br/>
		So with a fortunate day and fortunate star<br/>
		And moment in his chariot built for war,<br/>
		Golden, swiftrushing, with the Bird for sign<br/>
		And banner, sword and discus, bow divine<br/>
		And mace round hung, and horses twin of stride,<br/>
		Sugreve and Shaibya, went the lotus-eyed.<br/>
		And in his love the monarch Yudishthere<br/>
		Mounted, Daaruik, the great charioteer,<br/>
		Put quite aside.
		Himself he grasped the rein,<br/>
		Himself he drove the chariot o’er the plain.<br/>
		And great Urjuuna mounted, seized the white</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 36</p>
<p class="PE">Windbringer with the golden staff and bright<br/>
		And called with his strong arm the circling wind:<br/>
		And Bhema and the princes twin behind<br/>
		Followed, and citizen and holy priest:<br/>
		With the horizon the procession ceased.<br/>
		All these with the far-conquering Krishna wend.<br/>
		As a high Sage whom his disciples tend,<br/>
		So for a league they journeyed; then no more<br/>
		He suffered but Yudishthere’s will o’erbore<br/>
		And forced return; then grappled to his breast<br/>
		Urjuun belovèd.
		Greeting well the rest<br/>
		Religiously the monarch’s feet embraced<br/>
		Govinda, but the Pandove raised and kissed<br/>
		The head of Krishna beautiful-eyed.
		“Go then”<br/>
		He murmured; yet even so the word was vain<br/>
		Until reunion promised.
		Hardly at length<br/>
		He stayed them with entreaty’s utmost strength<br/>
		From following him on foot; so glad has gone<br/>
		Like Indra thundering to the immortals’ town.<br/>
		But they stood following with the eyes their light<br/>
		Until he vanished from the paths of sight.<br/>
		Ev’n then their hearts, though distance now conceals,<br/>
		Run yet behind his far invisible wheels.<br/>
		But the swift chariot takes their joy and pride,<br/>
		Too swift, alas! from eyes unsatisfied<br/>
		With that dear vision, and reluctant, slow,<br/>
		In thoughts that still with Krishna’s horsehooves go,<br/>
		Ceasing at last to their own town again<br/>
		Silent they wend, the lion lords of men.<br/>
		So entered the immortal Yudishthere<br/>
		Girt round with friends his glorious city; here<br/>
		He left them and in bowers for pleasure made<br/>
		With Draupadie the godlike hero played.<br/>
		But Krishna, glad of soul, in whirling car<br/>
		Came speeding to his noble town afar<br/>
		With Daaruik and the hero Saatyakie.<br/>
		Swift as the great God’s wingèd favourite he</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 37</p>
<p class="PE">Entered, and all the Yadove lords renowned<br/>
		Came honouring him, with one the chief and crowned.<br/>
		And Krishna stayed his father old to greet<br/>
		And Ahuik and his glorious mother’s feet<br/>
		And Bullaraam, his brother.
		His own sons<br/>
		He next embraced and all their little ones.<br/>
		Last of his elders leave he took and went<br/>
		To Rookminnie’s fair house in glad content.<br/>
		In Dwarca he; but the great Titan Mai<br/>
		Still pondered and imagined cunningly<br/>
		A jewelled brightness in his thought begun,<br/>
		An audience-hall supreme for Hades’ son.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-13">
		So with the conqueror unparalleled,<br/>
		Urjuun, the Titan now this discourse held.<br/>
		“To the great hill I go and soon return,<br/>
		Whose northern peaks from Coilas upward burn.<br/>
		There when the Titans sacrifice of yore<br/>
		Intended by the water Windusor,<br/>
		Rich waste of fine material was left,<br/>
		Wondrous, of stone a variegated weft<br/>
		That for the mighty audiencehall was stored<br/>
		Of Vrishapurvun, the truthspeaking lord.<br/>
		Thither I wend and make, if yet endure<br/>
		All that divine material bright and pure,<br/>
		The Pandove’s hall, a glory to behold,<br/>
		Admirable, set with jewelry and gold<br/>
		Taking the heart to pleasure.
		These besides<br/>
		A cruel mace in Windusor abides,<br/>
		Massive endurance, studded aureate,<br/>
		Ponderous, a death of foes, commensurate<br/>
		With many thousand more in murderous will.<br/>
		There after slaughter huge of foes it still<br/>
		Lies by a king relinquished.
		This believe<br/>
		For Bheme created as for thee Gandeve.<br/>
		There too the mighty conch Varunian lies:<br/>
		Thunders God-given swell its Ocean voice.<br/>
		Expect these from my hand infallibly.”<br/>
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 38</p>
<p class="PE">Thus saying went the Titan hastily<br/>
		To the northeastern edge of heaven where high<br/>
		Soars Mainaac hill into the northward sky<br/>
		From Coilas.
		Golden soar its ridges large<br/>
		And noble gems it stores and bright the marge<br/>
		Of Windusor.
		The high conceiving Lord,<br/>
		King of all creatures and by worlds adored,<br/>
		Here grandiose offerings gave and sacrifice<br/>
		By hundreds, and with excellent device,<br/>
		For beauty not to old tradition, made<br/>
		Pillars of sacrifice with gems inlaid<br/>
		And monumental temples massed with gold.<br/>
		Long here enduring Bhogiruth the bold<br/>
		Through tedious seasons dwelt, yearning to see<br/>
		Ganges, his selfnamed river Bhaagirothie.<br/>
		Nor these alone but he, the Argus-eyed<br/>
		Lord of imperial Sachi, to his side<br/>
		Victory by sacrifice compelled.
		Creating<br/>
		World systems, energy irradiating<br/>
		He sits here whom the awful ghosts attend,<br/>
		Shiva, who no beginning has nor end.<br/>
		Nur and Naraian there and Brahma there<br/>
		And Hades and the Immoveable repair,–<br/>
		Revolving when a thousand ages wend,<br/>
		To absolve with sacrifice the cycle’s end.<br/>
		Here now ambitious of religion gave<br/>
		Long years his mighty offerings Vaasudave,<br/>
		Devoutly, and bright temples raised their head,<br/>
		Memorial columns golden-garlanded,<br/>
		Unnumbered, multitudinous, immense.<br/>
		Thither went Maia and recovered thence<br/>
		Conchshell and mace and for the audiencehall<br/>
		The old Titanic stone marmoreal.<br/>
		All mighty wealth the servile giants guard,<br/>
		The Titan genius gathered and prepared<br/>
		His famous hall unparalleled, divine,<br/>
		Where all the jewels of the world combine.<br/>
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 39</p>
<p class="PE">To Bheme he gave that mighty mace, the shell<br/>
		Godgiven called, whose cry unutterable<br/>
		When from the great conch’s ocean mouth ’tis hurled<br/>
		Far borne, trembling of creatures fills the world,<br/>
		To great Urjuuna.
		But immense the hall<br/>
		Ten thousand cubits spread its bulk and all<br/>
		Its sides ten thousand, upon mighty boles<br/>
		Columnar elevate: nor either rolls<br/>
		The sun through heaven, moon nor vast fire so bright.<br/>
		Slaying the sunshine with superior light<br/>
		It blazed as if aflame, most luminous, white,<br/>
		Celestial, large, raised like a cloud to soar<br/>
		Against the heavens whose lustre it o’erbore.<br/>
		Nor weariness nor sorrow enter might<br/>
		That wide and noble palace of delight.<br/>
		Of fair material was it made, the walls<br/>
		And arches jewelled were of those rich halls.<br/>
		Such wonder of creative genius won<br/>
		The World’s Designer to comparison.<br/>
		For neither Brahma’s roof nor Vishnu’s high<br/>
		Might equal this for glorious symmetry.<br/>
		No, not Sudhurma, Indra’s council hall,<br/>
		With Maia’s cunning strove.
		At Maia’s call<br/>
		Eight thousand Helots of the Giant blood<br/>
		Upbore the pile and dreadful sentries stood<br/>
		Travellers on wind, hugebodied, horrible,<br/>
		Shell-eared, far-strikers, with bloodshot eyes and fell.<br/>
		And in the middle a lotus-lake he made<br/>
		Unparalleled, white lotuses displayed,<br/>
		And birds innumerable and all the stems<br/>
		Of that fair blossom were of beauteous gems<br/>
		And all the leaves were sapphires: through them rolled<br/>
		Gold tortoises and wondrous fish of gold.<br/>
		Marble mosaic was the stair: the wave<br/>
		Translucent ran its edges fine to lave,<br/>
		Wrinkled with soft cool winds that over it sped.<br/>
		A rain of pearl drops on the floor was shed.<br/>
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 40</p>
<p class="PE">And seats from slabs of precious stone combined<br/>
		The marble banks of that fair water lined.<br/>
		And all around it ever-flowering trees<br/>
		Of various race hung dark and huge with ease<br/>
		Of cool delightful shade, sweet-smelling woods<br/>
		And quiet waters where the white swan broods<br/>
		And ducks and waders of the ripples.
		Sweet<br/>
		The wind came from them, fragrance in its feet<br/>
		The lotus gave and lily of the land,<br/>
		And with its booty the great brothers fanned.<br/>
		Full fourteen months he laboured: the fifteenth<br/>
		Saw ready jewelled arch and luminous plinth.<br/>
		Then only came the Titan and declared<br/>
		To the just King his mighty hall prepared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-14">
		Ceremony of entrance Yudishthere<br/>
		Then held.
		Thousands of Brahmins luscious cheer<br/>
		Of rice with sugared milk enjoyed wherein<br/>
		Honey was mingled; flesh besides they win<br/>
		Of boar and stag and all roots eatable<br/>
		And fruits and sesamum-rice that tastes full well<br/>
		And grain of offering and pedary,<br/>
		Yea, meats of many natures variously<br/>
		Eaten and chewed, of drinks a vast array;<br/>
		And robes brought newly from the loom that day<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="T-15">But when Yudishthere had heard<br/>
		The sage’s speech, his heart was moved with sighs.<br/>
		He coveted Imperial Sacrifice.<br/>
		All bliss went from him.
		Only to his thought<br/>
		The majesty of royal saints was brought<br/>
		By sacrifice exalted, Paradise<br/>
		Acquired augustly, and before his eyes<br/>
		He most was luminous who in heaven shone,<br/>
		Heaven by sacrificial merit won.<br/>
		He too that offering would absolve; so now<br/>
		Receiving reverence with a courteous brow,<br/>
		The assembly broke, to meditate retiring<br/>
		On that great sacrifice of his desiring.<br/>
		Frequent the thought and ever all its length<br/>
		His mind leaned that way.
		Yet though huge his strength,<br/>
		His heroism though admired, the King<br/>
		Forgot not Right, but pondered how this thing<br/>
		Might touch the peoples, whether well or ill.<br/>
		For just was Yudishthere and courted still<br/>
		His people and with vast, impartial mind<br/>
		Served all, nor ever from this word declined,<br/>
		“To each his own; nor shall the King disturb<br/>
		With wrath or violence Right, but these shall curb.”<br/>
		So was all speech of men one grand acclaim;<br/>
		The nation as a father trusted him:<br/>
		No hater had he in his whole realm’s bound,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 42</p>
<p class="PE">By the sweet name of Enemiless renowned.<br/>
		And through his gracious government upheld<br/>
		By Bhema’s force and foreign battle quelled<br/>
		By the two-handed might of great Urjuun;<br/>
		Sahadave’s cultured equity and boon<br/>
		Necoola’s courteous mood to all men shown,<br/>
		The thriving provinces were void of fear;<br/>
		Strife was forgotten and each liberal year<br/>
		The rains were measured to desire; no man<br/>
		The natural limit of his course outran:<br/>
		Usury, tillage, rearing, merchandise<br/>
		Throve with good government and sacrifice<br/>
		Prospered; rack-renting was not nor unjust<br/>
		Extortion; from the land was pestilence thrust,<br/>
		And mad calamity of fire unknown<br/>
		Became while this just monarch had his own.<br/>
		Robbers and cheats and royal favourites<br/>
		Were now not heard of to infringe men’s rights<br/>
		Nor the king’s harm nor mutual injury<br/>
		Intrigue.
		To yield into his treasury<br/>
		Their taxes traders came and princes high<br/>
		On the sixfold pretexts of policy,<br/>
		Or at Yudishthere’s court good grace to win.<br/>
		Even greedy, passionate, luxurious men<br/>
		His just rule to the common welfare turned.<br/>
		He in the glory of all virtues burned,<br/>
		An all-pervading man, by all adored,–<br/>
		An emperor and universal lord<br/>
		Bearing upon his shoulders the whole State.<br/>
		And from the neatherd to the twice-born great<br/>
		All in his wide domains that lived and moved,<br/>
		Him more than father, more than mother loved.<br/>
		He now his brothers and his ministers<br/>
		Summoning severally their mind infers<br/>
		And often with repeated subtle speech<br/>
		Solicitous questions and requestions each.<br/>
		All with one cry unanimous advise</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE">To institute Imperial Sacrifice.<br/>
		“O king,” they said, “the man by God designed<br/>
		Who has acquired the Oceanic mind<br/>
		Of kingship, not with this bounds his pretence,<br/>
		But hungers for imperial excellence.<br/>
		In thee it dwells, high Cowrove; we thy friends<br/>
		See clear that Fate this sacrifice intends.<br/>
		To complete heroes it is subject.
		Men<br/>
		Who centre chivalry within them, gain<br/>
		Its sanction when with ancient chants the fires<br/>
		Are heaped by sages, lords of their desires<br/>
		Through selfcontrol intense.
		The serpentine<br/>
		And all rites other in this one rite twine.<br/>
		And he who at its end is safely crowned<br/>
		Is as World Conqueror, is as King renowned.<br/>
		Puissance is thine, great-armed, and we are thine.<br/>
		O King, soon then shall Empire crown thy line:<br/>
		O King, debate no longer; aim thy will<br/>
		At Sacrifice Imperial.”
		So they still<br/>
		Advised their King together and apart,<br/>
		And deep their accents sunk into his heart.<br/>
		Bold was their speech, rang pleasant to his ear,<br/>
		Seemed excellent and just, yet Yudishthere<br/>
		Still pondered though he knew his puissance well.<br/>
		Again he bade his hardy brothers tell<br/>
		Their mind and priests high-souled and ministers:<br/>
		With Dhaumya and Dwypaian too confers,<br/>
		Wise and deliberate he.
		“Speak justly, friends,<br/>
		What happy way my hard desire attends.<br/>
		Hard is the sacrifice imperial meant<br/>
		For an imperial mind’s accomplishment.”<br/>
		All answered with a seasonable voice:<br/>
		“Just King, thine is that mind and thou the choice<br/>
		Of Fate for this high ceremony renowned.”<br/>
		Sweet did the voice of friends and flamens sound:<br/>
		Yet still he curbed himself and still he thought.<br/>
		His yearning for the people’s welfare wrought</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 44</p>
<p class="PE">A noble hesitation.
		Wise the man<br/>
		Who often will his power and vantage scan,<br/>
		Who measures means with the expenditure,<br/>
		Season with place, then acts; his deeds endure.<br/>
		“Not with my mere resolve the enterprise<br/>
		Begins and ends of this great sacrifice.”<br/>
		While thus in a strong grasp his thought he held<br/>
		His mind to Krishna who all beings excelled<br/>
		Of mortal breed, for surest surety ran,<br/>
		Krishna, the strong unmeasurable man<br/>
		Whom Self-born upon earth conjectured he<br/>
		Because his deeds measured with deity.<br/>
		“To Krishna’s mind all things are penetrable:<br/>
		His genius knows not the impossible”<br/>
		Pondered the son of Hades “nor is there<br/>
		A weight his mighty mind cannot upbear.”<br/>
		On Krishna as on sage and guide his mind<br/>
		(Who is indeed the guide of all mankind)<br/>
		He fixed and sent his messenger afar<br/>
		To Yadove land in a swift-rolling car.<br/>
		Then sped the rushing wheels with small delay<br/>
		And reached the gated city Dwaraca,<br/>
		The gated city where Junnardun dwelt.<br/>
		Krishna to Yudishthere’s desire felt<br/>
		Answering desire and went with Indrosane<br/>
		Passing through many lands to Indra-Plain,<br/>
		Fierily passing with impetuous hooves<br/>
		To Indraprustha and the men he loves.<br/>
		With filial soul his brothers Yudishthere<br/>
		And Bheme received the man without compeer:<br/>
		But Krishna to his father’s sister went<br/>
		And greeted her with joyous love; then bent<br/>
		His heart to pleasure with his heart’s own friend,<br/>
		All reverently the courteous twins attend.<br/>
		But after rest in those bright halls renowned<br/>
		Yudishthere sought the immortal man and found<br/>
		At leisure sitting and revealed his need.<br/>
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 45</p>
<p class="PE">“King’s Sacrifice I covet, but indeed<br/>
		Thou knowest not practicable by will alone<br/>
		Like other rites is this imperial one,<br/>
		But he in whom all kingly things combine,<br/>
		He whom all men, all lands to honour join,<br/>
		A king above all kings, he finds alone<br/>
		Empire.
		And now though all my friends are one<br/>
		To bid me forward, yet do I attend<br/>
		From thy voice only certainty, O friend.<br/>
		Some from affection lovingly suppress<br/>
		Their friend’s worst fault and some from selfishness,<br/>
		Speaking what most will please.
		Others conceal<br/>
		Their own good with the name of commonweal.<br/>
		Such counsel in his need a monarch hath.<br/>
		But thou art pure of selfish purpose; wrath<br/>
		And passion know thee not; and thou wilt tell<br/>
		What shall be solely and supremely well.”<br/>
		Krishna made answer: “All thy virtues, all<br/>
		Thy gifts make thee the man imperial.<br/>
		Thou dost deserve this Sacrifice.
		Yet well<br/>
		Though thou mayst know it, one thing will I tell.<br/>
		When Raama, Jemadugny’s son, had slain<br/>
		The chivalry of earth, those who were fain<br/>
		To flee, left later issue to inherit<br/>
		The name of Kshettriya and the regal spirit.<br/>
		Of these the rule by compact of the clan<br/>
		Approved thou knowest, and each highborn man<br/>
		Whate’er and all the kingly multitude<br/>
		Name themselves subjects of great Ila’s brood<br/>
		And the Ixvaacuu house.
		Now by increase<br/>
		The Ixvaacuu Kings and Ilian count no less<br/>
		Than are a hundred clans.
		Of all most huge<br/>
		Yayaaty of the Bhojas, a deluge<br/>
		Upon the earth in multitude and gift.<br/>
		To these all chivalry their eyes uplift,<br/>
		These and their mighty fortunes serve.
		But now<br/>
		King Jerasundha lifts his diademed brow</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 46</p>
<p class="PE">And Ila and Ixvaacuu pale their fires,<br/>
		O’erwhelmed.
		He over kings and nations towers;<br/>
		This way and that way with impetuous hands<br/>
		Assailing overbears; the middle lands<br/>
		Inhabits and by division rules the world<br/>
		Since he in whose sole hand the earth is furled,<br/>
		Who is first monarch and supreme, may claim,<br/>
		He and he only, the imperial name.<br/>
		And him the mighty hero Shishupaal<br/>
		Owns singly nor disdains his lord to call<br/>
		But leads his warfare, and, of captains best,<br/>
		The puissant man and subtle strategist,<br/>
		Vuccar, the Koruush king, and those two famed<br/>
		Grew to his side, Hunsa and Dimbhuc named,<br/>
		Brave men and high of heart; and Corrusus,<br/>
		Duntvuccar, Meghovaahon, Corobhus,<br/>
		Great kings; and the wide-ruler of the west,<br/>
		The Yovun lord upon whose gleaming crest<br/>
		Burns the strange jewel wonderful, whose might<br/>
		Is like the boundless Ocean’s infinite,<br/>
		Whose rule Norac obeys and Muruland.<br/>
		King Bhogadutt owns Jerasundh’s command,<br/>
		Thy father’s ancient friend, and more with hand<br/>
		Serves him than word.
		He only of the west<br/>
		And southern end of earth who is possessed,<br/>
		The hero Kuuntiewurdhun Puurujit<br/>
		Feels for thee as a tender father might.<br/>
		Chained by affection to thee is his heart<br/>
		And by affection in thy weal has part.<br/>
		To Jerasundh he whom I did not slay<br/>
		Is gathered, he who must forsooth display<br/>
		My signs, gives himself out god humanized<br/>
		And man ideal, and for such is prized<br/>
		Now in the world, a madman soiled of soul,<br/>
		The tyrant of the Chédies, whose control<br/>
		Poundra and Keerat own, a mighty lord,<br/>
		King of Bengal and by the name adored</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 47</p>
<p class="PE">Of Poundrian Vaasudave.
		The Bhoja strong<br/>
		To whom wide lands, one fourth of all, belong,<br/>
		Called friend of Indra – he made tameable<br/>
		Pandya and Cruth and Koyshic by his skill<br/>
		And science, and his brother Aacritie<br/>
		Is very Purshuraam in prowess – he,<br/>
		Even Bheeshmuc, even this high, far-conquering king<br/>
		To Jerasundh is vowed.
		We worshipping,<br/>
		We who implore his favour, we his kin<br/>
		Are utterly rejected, all our pain<br/>
		Of benefaction met with sharp contempt,<br/>
		Benefit with harm returned or evil attempt.<br/>
		He has forgot his birth, his pride, his name;<br/>
		Blinded by Jerasundha’s burning fame<br/>
		To him is gone.
		To him high fortune yields;<br/>
		Great nations leave their old ancestral fields.<br/>
		The Bhojas of the North to western plain<br/>
		Their eighteen clans transplanted, Surasegn,<br/>
		Shalwa, Petucchur, Kuuntie, Bhudrocar,<br/>
		Suisthull, Kulind, Sucuitta.
		All that are<br/>
		Of the Shalwaian Kings brother or friend,<br/>
		Are with their leaders gone, nor yet an end:<br/>
		The Southern Punchaals and in Kuuntie-land<br/>
		The Eastern Coshalas.
		Their native north<br/>
		Abandoning the Mutsyas have gone forth<br/>
		And from their fear take southern sanctuary:<br/>
		With them the clan Sunnyustopaad.
		Lastly<br/>
		The warrior great Punchaalas terrified<br/>
		Have left their kingdoms and to every side<br/>
		Are scattering before Jerasundha’s name.<br/>
		On us the universal tempest came,<br/>
		When Kunsa furiously crushed of old<br/>
		The Yadoves: for to Kunsa bad and bold<br/>
		The son of Brihodruth his daughters gave<br/>
		Born younger feminine to male Sahadave,<br/>
		Ustie and Praapthie.
		In this tie made strong<br/>
		His royal kin he overpowered; nor long,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 48</p>
<p class="PE">Being supreme, ruled prudently, but grew<br/>
		A tyrant and a fool.
		Whereupon drew<br/>
		The Bhoja lords together, those whom tired<br/>
		His cruelties, and these with me conspired<br/>
		Seeking a national deliverer.<br/>
		Therefore I rose and Ahuik’s daughter, her<br/>
		The sweet and slender, gave to Ocroor,– then<br/>
		Made free from tyranny my countrymen.<br/>
		With me was Raam, the plougher of the foe;<br/>
		Our swords laid Kunsa and Sunaaman low.<br/>
		Scarce was this inbred peril crossed and we<br/>
		Safe, Jerasundh arose.
		Then laid their plans<br/>
		By vast majority the eighteen clans,<br/>
		That though we fought for ever, though we slew<br/>
		With mighty blows infallible, o’erthrew<br/>
		Foe upon foe, three centuries might take wing<br/>
		Nor yet be slain the armies of the King.<br/>
		For him and his two men like gods made strong,<br/>
		Unslayable where the weapons thickest throng;<br/>
		Hunsa and Dimbhuc styled.
		These two uniting,<br/>
		Heroes, and Jerasundh heroic fighting<br/>
		Might battle with assembled worlds and win;<br/>
		Such was my thought, nor mine alone has been,<br/>
		But all the kings this counsel entertain,<br/>
		O wisest Yudishthere.
		Now there was slain<br/>
		By Raam in eight days’ battle duelling<br/>
		One Hunsa truly named, a mighty King.<br/>
		‘Hunsa is slain!’ said one to Dimbhuc.
		Him<br/>
		Hearing the Jumna’s waters overwhelm<br/>
		Devoted.
		Without Hunsa here alone<br/>
		He had not heart to linger, so is gone<br/>
		His way to death.
		Of Dimbhuc’s death when knew<br/>
		Hunsa, sacker of cities, he too drew<br/>
		To the same waves that closed above his friend.<br/>
		There were they joined in one o’erwhelming end.<br/>
		This hearing Jerasundha discontent<br/>
		With empty heart to his own city went.<br/>
</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 49</p>
<p class="PE">The King being gone we in all joy again<br/>
		In Mothura dwelt and our ancestral plain.<br/>
		But she, the royal princess lotus-eyed,<br/>
		Went to her father mourning; she, the pride<br/>
		Of Jerasundh and Kunsa’s wife, and cried,<br/>
		Spurring the mighty Maagudh, weeping: ‘Kill<br/>
		My husband’s murderer, O my father,’ and still:<br/>
		‘Kill him!’
		But we minding the old thought planned<br/>
		With heavy hearts out from our native land,<br/>
		Son, friend and kinsman, all in fear must flee.<br/>
		Our endless riches’ loose prolixity<br/>
		Unportable by division we compressed<br/>
		And with it fared sadly into the west.<br/>
		The lovely city, fair Cuishusthaly,<br/>
		With mountains beautiful, our colony<br/>
		We made, the Ryevut mountains; and up-piled<br/>
		Ramparts which even the gods in battle wild<br/>
		Could hardly scale, ramparts which women weak<br/>
		Might hold – of Vrishny’s swords what call to speak?<br/>
		Five are the leagues our dwelling place extends,<br/>
		Three are the mountain-shoulders and each ends<br/>
		An equal space: hundred-gated the town.<br/>
		Each gate with heroism and renown<br/>
		Is bolted and has eighteen keys close-bound,<br/>
		Eighteen strong bows in whom the trumpet’s sound<br/>
		Wakes headlong lust of war.
		Thousands as many<br/>
		Our race.
		Ahuik has hundred sons nor any<br/>
		Less than a god.
		And Charudéshna, he<br/>
		With his dear brother, hero Saatyakie,<br/>
		Chucrodave, I, the son of Rohinnie,<br/>
		And Samba and Prodyoumna, seven are we,<br/>
		Seven strong men; nor other seven more weak,<br/>
		Cunca and Shuncou, Kuuntie and Someque,<br/>
		Anadhrishty, Somitinjoy, Critovurm;<br/>
		Undhuc’s two sons besides and the old King: firm<br/>
		As adamant they, heroes energical.<br/>
		These are the Vrishny men who lead there, all</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 50</p>
<p class="PE">Remembering the sweet middle lands we lost.<br/>
		There we behold that flood of danger crossed<br/>
		The Maagudh, Jerasundh, the mountain jaws<br/>
		Impassable behold.
		There free from cause<br/>
		Of fear, eastern or northern, Modhou’s sons<br/>
		Dwell glad of safety.
		Lo, we the mighty ones,<br/>
		Because King Kunsa married, to the west,<br/>
		By Jerasundha utterly distressed,<br/>
		Are fled, and there on Ryevut, hill of kine,<br/>
		Find sanctuary from danger Magadhine.<br/>
		Therefore though all imperial gifts and high<br/>
		Vindicate thee, though o’er earth’s chivalry<br/>
		Thou shouldst be Emperor indeed, nowise<br/>
		Shalt thou accomplish, King, the Sacrifice<br/>
		Great Jerasundha living; for he brings<br/>
		The princes of the earth and all her kings<br/>
		And Girivraj with mighty prisoners fills<br/>
		As in a cavern of the lordly hills,<br/>
		A lion’s homestead, slaughtered elephants lie –<br/>
		So they a hecatomb of royalty<br/>
		Wait their dire ending; for Magadha’s King<br/>
		A sacrifice of princes purposing,<br/>
		With fierce asceticism of will adored<br/>
		Mahadave mighty-minded, Uma’s lord.<br/>
		Conquering he moves towards his purpose, brings<br/>
		Army on army, kings on battling kings,<br/>
		Victorious brings and binds and makes of men<br/>
		His mountain-city a huge cattle-pen.<br/>
		Us too his puissance drove in strange dismay<br/>
		To the fair-gated city, Dwaraca.<br/>
		Therefore if of imperial sacrifice<br/>
		Thou art ambitious, first, O prince, devise<br/>
		To rescue all those murdered Kings and slay<br/>
		King Jerasundha, since thus only may<br/>
		The instituted sacrifice attain<br/>
		Its great proportion and immenser plan.<br/>
		King, I have said; yet as thy deeper mind</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 51</p>
<p class="PE">Adviseth thee.
		Only when all’s designed,<br/>
		All reasons weighed, then give me word.”
		“O thou<br/>
		Art only wise,” Yudishthere cried.
		“Lo now<br/>
		A word no other heart might soar so high<br/>
		As utter; yet thy brave sagacity<br/>
		Plainly hath phrased it; nor like thee on earth<br/>
		Another sword of counsel shall take birth.<br/>
		Behold, the earth is full of kings; they still<br/>
		Each in his house do absolutely their will;<br/>
		Yet who attains to empire?
		Nay, the word<br/>
		Itself is danger.
		He who has preferred<br/>
		His enemy’s greatness by sad study known,<br/>
		How shall he late forget and praise his own?<br/>
		Only who in his foemen’s shock not thrown<br/>
		Wins by ordeal praise, deserves the crown.<br/>
		This vast and plenteous earth, this mine of gems,<br/>
		Is from a distance judged, how vast its realms,<br/>
		Not from the dells.
		Nor otherwise, O pride<br/>
		Of Vrishny’s seed, man’s greatness is espied.<br/>
		In calm and sweet content is highest bliss,<br/>
		Mine be the good that springs from chastened peace.<br/>
		I even with attempt hope not the crown<br/>
		Of high supremacy to wear.
		Renown<br/>
		Girds these and highborn mind; and so they deem<br/>
		“Lo I or I am warrior and supreme”,<br/>
		Yet if by chance one better prove mid men,<br/>
		It is but chance who wins the crown and when.<br/>
		But we by Jerasundha’s force alarmed<br/>
		And all his mighty tyrannies ironarmed<br/>
		Shun the emprise.
		O hero, O highstarred<br/>
		In whose great prowess we have done and dared,<br/>
		On whose heroic arm our safeties dwell<br/>
		Yet lo thou fear’st him, deem’st invincible<br/>
		And where thou fearest, my conceit of strength<br/>
		Becomes a weakling’s dream until at length<br/>
		I hardly dare to hope by strongest men<br/>
		This mighty Jerasundha can be slain,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 52</p>
<p class="PE">Urjuun or Bheme or Raama or combined.<br/>
		Thou, Késhove, in all things to me art Mind.”<br/>
		Out Bhema spoke, the strong man eloquent.<br/>
		“The unstrenuous king, unhardy, unvigilant<br/>
		Sinks like an anthill; nor the weak-kneed less<br/>
		Who on a stronger leans his helplessness.<br/>
		But the unsleeping and resourceful man<br/>
		With wide and adequate attempt oft can<br/>
		His mightier enemy vanquish: him though feeble<br/>
		His wished-for good attends invariable.<br/>
		Krishna has policy and I have strength<br/>
		And with our mother’s son, Dhonunjoy, length<br/>
		Assured of victory dwells; we shall assail<br/>
		Victoriously the Magadhan and quell<br/>
		As triple fire a victim.”
		Krishna then:<br/>
		“Often we see that rash unthinking men<br/>
		Imprudent undertake, nor consequence<br/>
		Envisage: yet will not his foe dispense<br/>
		Therefore the one-ideaed and headstrong man.<br/>
		Now since the virtuous ages first began<br/>
		Five emperors have been to history known,<br/>
		Maroutta, Bharut, Yuvanuswa’s son,<br/>
		Great Bhogiruth and Cartoverya old.<br/>
		By wealth Maroutta conquered, Bharut bold<br/>
		By armèd strength; Mandhata’s victories<br/>
		Enthroned him and his subtle soul and wise.<br/>
		By strenuous greatness Cartoverya bent<br/>
		The world; but Bhogiruth beneficent<br/>
		Gathered the willing nations to his sway.<br/>
		Thou purposing like greatness, to one way<br/>
		Not limited, restor’st the imperial five.<br/>
		Their various masteries reunited live –<br/>
		Virtue, high policy, wealth without dearth<br/>
		And conquest and the rapid grasp at Earth –<br/>
		And yet avail not to make solely great.<br/>
		Strong Jerasundha bars thee from thy fate,<br/>
		Whom not the hundred nations can deter</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="PE">But with great might he grows an emperor;<br/>
		The jewel-sceptred Kings to serve him start.<br/>
		Yet he in his unripe and violent heart<br/>
		Unsatisfied, assumes the tyrant’s part.<br/>
		He, the first man of men, lays his rude hand<br/>
		On the anointed monarchs of the land<br/>
		And pillages.
		Not one we see exempt.<br/>
		How then shall feebler king his fall attempt?<br/>
		Well-nigh a hundred in his sway are whelmed.<br/>
		With these like cattle cleansed, like cattle hemmed<br/>
		In Sheva’s house, the dreadful Lord of beasts,<br/>
		Purified as for sacrificial feasts,<br/>
		Surely life’s joy is turned to bitterness,<br/>
		Not dying like heroes in the battle’s press.<br/>
		Honour is his who in swift battle falls<br/>
		And best mid swords high death to princes calls.<br/>
		In battle let us ’gainst the Maagudh thrust,<br/>
		By battle ignominy repel.
		To just<br/>
		Eighty and six the royal victims mount,<br/>
		Fourteen remain to fill the dire account;<br/>
		Who being won his horrid violence<br/>
		No farther pause will brook.
		Glory immense<br/>
		He wins, glory most glorious who frustrates<br/>
		Interposing the tyrant and amates.<br/>
		Kings shall acclaim him lord inevitably.”<br/>
		But Yudishthere made answer passionately:<br/>
		“Shall I, ambitious of imperial place,<br/>
		Krishna, expose in my mad selfishness,<br/>
		Upbuoyed by naked daring, men to death<br/>
		Whom most I love?
		O Krishna, what is breath<br/>
		To one that’s mad and of his eyes bereft?<br/>
		What joy has he that life to him is left?<br/>
		These are my eyes, thou Krishna art my mind:<br/>
		Lo I have come as one who stumbles blind<br/>
		Upon the trackless Ocean’s spuming shore,<br/>
		Then wakes, so I all confident before<br/>
		Upon this dreadful man whom even death</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 54</p>
<p class="PE">Dare not in battle cross.
		What use is breath<br/>
		Of hopeless effort?
		Mischief only can<br/>
		Result to the too blindly daring man.<br/>
		Better not undertaken, is my mind<br/>
		On riper thought, than fruitlessly designed.<br/>
		Nay, let us leave this purpose; wiser so<br/>
		Than with eyes open to our death to go.<br/>
		For all my heart within is broken and slain<br/>
		Viewing the vast impracticable pain<br/>
		Of Sacrifice Imperial.”
		Then replied<br/>
		To Yudishthere great Partha in the pride<br/>
		Of wonders selfattained, banner and car,<br/>
		And palace Titan-built and in the war<br/>
		Quiver made inexhaustible and great<br/>
		Unequalled bow.
		“O King” he said “since Fate<br/>
		Has given me bow and shafts, a sword like flame,<br/>
		Great lands and strength, courage, allies and fame,<br/>
		Yea, such has given as men might covet long<br/>
		And never win; O King, what more?
		For strong<br/>

		Courage is strongest strength.
		How helps it then<br/>

		His fathers were?
		From uncourageous sires<br/>
		Who springs a hero, he to glory towers.<br/>
		That man the name of Kshettriya merits best<br/>
		Whose soul is ever to the battle drest.<br/>
		Courage, all gifts denied, ploughs through amain<br/>
		A sea of foes: courage without in vain<br/>
		All other gifts conspire; rather all gifts<br/>
		Courage into a double stature lifts.<br/>
		But conquest is in three great strengths complete –<br/>
		Action, capacity, fate: where these three meet,<br/>
		There conquest comes; nor strengths alone suffice;<br/>
		Men by neglect forfeit their Paradise.<br/>
		And this the cause the strong much-hated man<br/>
		Before his enemies sinks.

		For when in battle combined<br/>
		Conduct meets long felicity, then high<br/>
		Success must come nor two met equally<br/>
		Equal can issue thence: from clash and strife<br/>
		Of equals inequality takes life.<br/>
		But rash impolicy with helplessness<br/>
		Having joined issue in their mutual stress<br/>
		Breed ruin huge; equality inglorious<br/>
		Then doubt engenders, nor are both victorious.<br/>

		If we devise<br/>

		He said, and those three huge in hardihood,<br/>
		The Vrishny hero and the Pandoves twain,<br/>
		Went forth to Magadha of happy men.<br/>
		To Girivraj, the city of the hills,<br/>
		A nation of the fourfold orders fills,<br/>

		Flushed with high festival and void of care,<br/>
		A virgin city inviolable in war.<br/>
		So came they to the city gates where soared<br/>
		The height by Brihodrutha’s sons adored<br/>
		And all the people, one of peaks that stand,<br/>
		Delightful hills, Chytyuc, in Magadh land; –<br/>
		Thither they storming came.
		There Rishabha,<br/>

		These in his city placed the Maagudh King.<br/>
		Covered with dust of glorious blossoms there<br/>
		The drums hurled oft their thunders through the air.<br/>
		But now came storming to the Chytyuc wall<br/>
		The heroes and the wardrums broke and all<br/>
		Upon the rampart fell as if to smite<br/>
		The very head of Jerasundha’s might:<br/>
		Chytyuc, the ancient peak enorm, deep-based,</p>

		To war with Jerasundh they came, and yet<br/>
		Weapons of war had none, with their arms merely<br/>
		Sworded and shielded with the vow austerely<br/>
		Assumed wherein men enter worldly life,<br/>
		Snaatucs.
		A town they saw with riches rife,<br/>
		Food-mart and flower-mart and populous street,<br/>
		In all desirable wealth grandly complete.<br/>
		So went they mid the shops and highroad wide<br/>
		And from the garland-makers in the pride<br/>
		Of hostile strength fresh garlands violently<br/>
		They mastered.
		Then in bright variety<br/>
		Of garments manyhued the mighty three<br/>
		With wreaths and burnished earrings bright aflame<br/>
		To Jerasundha’s lordly dwelling came.<br/>
		As lions of the Himalaya eye<br/>

		But on the Maagudh men amazement fell<br/>

		And great of shoulder and like boles their arms<br/>
		Of shaal-trees mighty, fit for warlike harms;<br/>
		Now sandal-smeared and rubbed with aloe-scent.<br/>

		And the great king arose, for them he judged<br/>
		Worthy of high guest-offerings, nowise grudged<br/>
		The water for the feet, the honied curds<br/>
		And gifts of kine, but with deservèd words<br/>
		Greeted them crying “Welcome, holy men.”<br/>
		And no word answered him the Pandoves twain.<br/>
		Then Krishna in their midst, the man of mind,<br/>
		Said only “King of kings, these two must bind</p>

<p class="PE">Silence till midnight hour, envisaging<br/>

		So in the chamber sacrificial placed<br/>
		They sojourned and the King with awe possessed<br/>
		Returned to his high mansion.
		But when night<br/>
		Was deep, went the strong arbiter of fight<br/>
		To those three twice-born; for his vow preferred<br/>
		Compelled him, through earth famous, when he heard<br/>
		Of Snaatuc Brahmins in his city bright<br/>
		To meet them even in the deep midnight.<br/>
		And they indeed with strange astonishment<br/>
		Dismayed him and their garments hue-besprent<br/>
		Unwonted.
		As he came the three arose,<br/>
		The lion men, the victors of their foes.<br/>
		“Welfare, O King” they cried, and each on each<br/>
		They looked and scanned the King awaiting speech.<br/>
		Then to those lords concealed in priestly dress<br/>
		The King said with his haughty graciousness,<br/>
		“Sit, holy men.”
		They sat, heroic forms<br/>
		Blazing with mightier beauty than informs<br/>
		The fires of sacrifice, when a great king<br/>
		Sacrifices.
		And sternly censuring<br/>
		Disguise and travesty of shape sincere<br/>
		The conqueror steadfast, “Why come you here,<br/>

		Then Krishna in a deep and quiet voice<br/>

		“Brahmins thou deemest us whom duties call<br/>

		Rightly thou sayest, King, the Kshettriya’s might<br/>

		Wild words and many uses not; for God<br/>
		Set in the arm, its natural abode,<br/>

		Today thou shalt behold it.
		Nor debate<br/>
		Of path allowable and door and gate.<br/>
		No gate is in the house of enemies.<br/>
		By the plain door a friend’s house entered is,<br/>
		But by no door with ruin impetuous<br/>

		These are virtue’s gates and thus<br/>
		Enters the self-possessed, right-seeing man.<br/>
		Nor offering hospitable take we can<br/>
		In foemen’s house with deeds upon our hands.<br/>
		This is our vow and this eternal stands.”<br/>
		And Jerasundh replied, “Enmity, strife<br/>
		I can recall not gazing through my life,<br/>
		Brahmins, with you begun, nor aught that men<br/>
		Pervert to hatred.
		Wherefore call you then<br/>
		A sinless man your enemy?

<p class="PE">And he, the Kshettriya who with causeless blame<br/>

		That virtue and that life are mine.

		Krishna made sterner answer: “Great<br/>
		Is he who sent us, of a mighty strain<br/>
		Upbearer, and upon his shoulders lain<br/>
		The burden of a deed for kindred blood.<br/>
		From him we come upon thee like a flood.<br/>

		When before<br/>

		Great witlessness<br/>

		Who would not by the way of battle then<br/>

		and unrighteous, for greed of their kingdom; yea all this is known to you utterly.
		Considering therefore their growing greed and the righteousness of Yudhisthere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="84" href="#">15</a>, considering also their close kinship, form you a judgment each man to himself and together.
		And since these have always clung to truth and loyally observed the contract, if now they<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">16</a> are wronged, they may well slay all the sons of Dhritarashtra.
		And hearing of any wrong done by these in this business their friends would gather round the Pandavas, yea and
		repel war with war and slay them.
		If natheless ye deem these too weak in numbers for victory, yet would they all band together and with their
		friends at last strive<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86" href="#">17</a> to destroy them.
		Moreover none knoweth the mind of Duryodhan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="87" href="#">18</a> rightly, what he
		meaneth to do, and what can you decide that shall be the best to set about when you know not the mind of your

		This hearing, the just, expedient, sweet and impartial speech of Janardan, the elder brother of him took up the

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="2">2</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="T-23">So the mighty ones of the Kurus and they of their faction performed joyously the marriage of Abhimanyu,
		and that night they rested but at dawn fared, pleased of heart, to the Council Hall of Virata.
		The Hall of the Lord of the Matsyas, opulent, curious with workings of pearl and the best of jewels, with seats
		disposed, and wreathed with garlands and full of fragrance, thither they fared, the Elders of the Kings of men.
		And of those that took their seats in the Hall, the first place was for both the Princes of the folk, even Virat
		and Drupad and those that were aged and revered among the Masters of Earth, and Rama and Janardan with their
		sire.
		Next to the King of the Panchalas sat the mighty one of the Shinis with the son of Rohinnie and very nigh to the
		Matsya King both Janardan and Yudhisthere, and all the sons of Drupad the King, and Bhema and Urjoon, and the
		sons of Madrie, and Pradyumna and Samba mighty in the battle and with the sons of Virata Abhimanyu.
		And all those heroes equal to their sires in prowess and beauty and strength, the princes, sons of Draupadie,
		sat on noble thrones curious with gold.
		High shone that opulent Place of Kings with the warriors there sitting in glittering ornaments and gleaming
		robes as heaven shines invaded by the clear bright stars.
		Then when those mighty ones had done with varied talk of general import they tarried in thought a moment, all
		those Kings gazing towards Krishna; and talk being over, spurred by the Madhav for business of the sons of Pandu
		the lion lords assembled hearkened to his word of import mighty and majestic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-24">Srikrishna spake.
		“Known is it to you all how Yudhisthere here was conquered by Subala’s son in the Hall of Dicing, beaten </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 70</p>
<p class="PE"> by fraud, and his kingdom wrested from him and compact made of exile in the forest.
		Though able to win the Earth by violence yet the sons of Pandu stood firmly in the truth, for truth is their
		chariot, and for years six and seven all the severity of that vow has been kept by these first of men.
		And hardest to pass this thirteenth year, lo they have passed it undiscovered before your eyes, bearing
		intolerable ills, even as they had sworn,– that too is known of you all,– appointed to servile office in a house
		of strangers, mighty, in their own might, O King, they have won through all.
		Since so it is, ponder now what may be for the good of the King, the son of Righteousness, and the good of
		Duryodhan and of the Kurus and the Pandavas, and just also and right and for the honour and glory of all.
		For Yudhisthere the Just would desire not the kingship of the gods itself if with unrighteousness it came.
		But to lordship of earth he would aspire though even in some hamlet, so it went with justice and prosperous
		doing.
		For it is known to the Kings how his father’s kingdom was torn from him by the children of Dhritarashtra and how
		by that false dealing he fell into great peril and very hard to bear; for neither was the son of Pritha
		overthrown in battle by the children of Dhritarashtra in the energy of their own might.
		Yet even so the King and his friends desire that these should not come to hurt; but what the sons of Pandu
		gathered with their own conquering hands by force done on the lords of land, this these mighty ones seek for,
		Coonty’s sons and the sons of Madry.
		But all this is known to you aright, how these even when they were children were pursued to slay them with
		various device by those their foemen, dishonest and fierce and bent to rob them of their realm.
		Seeing how that greed of theirs is grown and looking to the righteous mind of Yudhisthere and looking also to
		their kinship form ye your separate minds and an united counsel.
		For ever have these made truth and honour their delight and wholly have they kept the compact, and now if they
		have dealing from the others otherwise than in truth and honour, they will slay the assembled children of
		Dhritarashtra.
		For when ’tis heard that these have been evilly dealt with by their cousins, the friends of Dhritarashtra’s sons
		will gather to </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 71</p>
<p class="PE">protect the illdoers and they will oppose these with war, and they, opposed with war, will slay them
		all.
		And even if ’tis your mind that these by their fewness are not strong for victory, they will band themselves all
		together with their friends and yet strive for the destruction of the Dhritarashtrians.
		Neither do we know aright the mind of Duryodhan and what it is that he will do, and unknowing the mind of the
		foe, what can you decide that would be truly right to start upon?
		Therefore let one go hence, a man righteous, pure, well born and heedful, a fit envoy, for pacifying of
		Dhritarashtra’s sons and the gift to Yudhisthere of half the kingdom.”</p>

		Now as the Ape-bannered, the Pandove, saw the Dhritarashtrians at their warlike posts, so heaved he up his bow

<p class="P" search_id="T-34">Thus, O Bharata, to Hrishikésha Gudakésha said, who set in the midst between either army the noble car,

		There Partha saw fathers and grandsires stand and teachers and uncles and brothers and sons and grandsons and

		There when the son of Coonty beheld all these dear friends and kindred facing each other in fight, his heart was
		besieged with utter pity and failed him and he said:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-35">“O Krishna, I behold these kinsmen and friends arrayed in hostile arms and my limbs sink beneath me and
		my face grows dry, and there are shudderings in my body and my hair stands on end, Gandeva falls from my hand
		and my very skin is on fire.
		Yea I cannot stand, my brain whirls and evil omens, O Késhove, </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 77</p>
<p class="PE">meet mine eyes.
		I can see no blessing for me, having slain my kin in fight.
		I desire not victory, O Krishna, no nor kingship nor delights.
		What shall we do with kingship, O Govinda, what with enjoyments, what with life?
		They for whose sake we desire kingship and enjoyments and delight, lo they all stand in battle against us
		casting behind them their riches and their lives, our teachers and our fathers and our sons, our grandsires and
		uncles and the fathers of our wives and our grandsons and our wives’ brothers and the kin of our beloved.
		These though they slay me, O Madhusudan, I would not slay, no not for the empire of heaven and space and hell,
		much less for this poor earth of ours.
		Slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra what joy would be left to us, O Janardana?
		Sin, sin alone would find lodging in us, if we slew these though our adversaries and foes.
		Therefore we do not right to slay the children of Dhritarashtra and their friends, for how can we be happy, O
		Madhove, if we slay our kin?
		Even though these see not, for their hearts are swept away by greed, error done in the ruin of one’s house and
		grievous sin in treachery to natural friends, how shall we not understand and turn back from this sin, we who
		have eyes, O Janardan, for error done in the ruin of our house?
		When the family dwindles, the eternal ideals of the race are lost, and when ideals are lost, unrighteousness
		besets the whole race; in the prevalence of unrighteousness, O Krishna, the women of the race go astray, and
		when women grow corrupt, bastard confusion is born again; but confusion brings the slayers of their race and the
		race itself to very hell; for the long line of fathers perishes and the food ceases and the water is given no
		more.
		By these their sins who bring their race to perdition, fathers they of bastard confusion, the eternal ideals of
		the nation and the hearth are overthrown; and for men who have lost the ancient righteousnesses of the race, in
		hell an eternal habitation is set apart, ’tis told.
		Alas a dreadful sin have we set ourselves to do, that from greed of lordship and pleasure we have made ready to
		slay our own kin.
		Yea even if the sons of Dhritarashtra slay me with their armèd hands, me unarmed and unresisting, it were better
		and more fortunate for me than this.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="T-43">Thou grievest for whom thou shouldst not grieve and yet speakest wise-seeming words, but the wise

		It is not that I was not before, nor thou nor these lords of the folk, nor yet that we all shall not be again
		hereafter.
		Even as the embodied spirit passes in this body to boyhood and youth and age, so also it passes away from this
		body to another; the strong man suffers not his soul to be clouded by this.
		But the things of material touch, O son of Coonty, which bring cold and warmth, pleasure and pain, they come and
		they pass; transient are they, these seek to abandon, O Bharata.
		The man whom these vex not, O lion of men, who is strong and receiveth sorrow and bliss as one, that man is
		ready for immortality.
		For that which is not, there is no coming into being and for that which is, there is no ceasing to be; yea of
		both of these the lookers into truth have seen an end.
		But That in which all this universe is extended, know to be imperishable; none hath force to bring to nought the
		One who decays not neither passes away.
		Finite and transient are these bodies called of the eternal, imperishable and immeasurable embodied Spirit;
		arise therefore and fight, O seed of Bharat.
		Who knoweth the Spirit as slayer and who deemeth Him to be slain, both of these discern not: He slayeth not
		neither is He slain.
		“He is not born nor dieth ever, nor having once been shall He not be again; He is unborn for ever and perpetual,
		He is the Ancient One who is not slain with the slaying of the body.”
		He who knoweth Him to be imperishable, eternal, unborn and undecaying, whom doth that man, O Partha, slay or
		cause to be slain?
		As a man casteth from him his worn out robes and taketh to him other and new raiment, so the embodied Spirit
		casteth away its worn out bodies and goeth to other and new casings.
		Him the sword cleaveth not, Him the fire cannot burn, Him water wetteth not and the hot wind withereth not away;
		indivisible, unconsumable, unmergible, unwitherable is He.
		He is for ever and everywhere, constant and moveth not, He is the One Sempiternal Being.
		If thou knowest Him as such, thou hast no cause to grieve.</p>

<p class="PE">ever dying, even so thou hast no cause to grieve for him, O strong-armed.
		For of that which is born the death is certain, and of that which is dead, the birth is sure; therefore in a
		thing inevitable thou oughtest not to grieve.
		Unmanifested in their beginning are creatures, manifested in the middle, O Bharata; they become but unmanifest
		again at death; what room is here for lamentation?
		As a Mystery one seeth Him, as a Mystery another speaketh of Him, as a Mystery a third heareth of Him, but even
		with revelation not one knoweth Him.
		The embodied One is for ever unslayable in the body of every man, O Bharata, and from Him are all creatures;
		therefore thou hast no cause for grief.
		Moreover if thou considerest the law of thine own being, thou oughtest not to tremble, for than battle in a just
		cause the Kshatriya knows no greater bliss.
		Happy are the Kshatriyas, O Partha, who win such a battle to their portion; ’tis as though one came past by
		chance and found the door of Paradise open.
		Now if thou wilt not wage this just and righteous battle, then hast thou cast from thee thy glory and the law of
		thy being, and brought sin upon thy head; yea thy shame shall be eternal in the mouth of all creatures, and for
		one who has been honoured, shame is worse than death.
		The warriors will think that from fear thou hast ceased from battle, and in their eyes who thought highly of
		thee, thou shalt be belittled.
		And thine illwishers will speak of thee many unutterable words, disparaging thy might and thy greatness, than
		which there is no worse bitterness under the skies.
		Slain thou shalt conquer heaven, victorious thou shalt enjoy earth for thy kingdom, therefore, O son of Coonty,
		arise with a heart resolute for war.
		Make thou thy soul indifferent to pain and pleasure, to gain and loss, to victory and defeat, then gird thyself
		to the combat; sin shall not touch thee then.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-45">Thus hath been declared to thee the mind that dwells in the way of Sankhya, hearken now to that which

		this Law saveth the heart from its great fear.
		One is the mind of </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 82</p>
<p class="PE">a man that holds fast to its aim, but infinite are their minds and manybranching who have no resolved

		’Tis a flowery word they babble, men of little understanding who take delight in the creed of Veda, disputing,
		saying “There is nought else”, their souls full of desires, their hopes bent upon Heaven; but he who hearkeneth
		to their word that giveth but the fruit of life’s actions and is crowded with multifold ritual, aiming only at
		splendour and enjoyment and lordship, lo it hurrieth away his heart and causeth it to cling to lordship and
		pleasure and his mind is unfixed to God and cannot set itself on the rock of concentration.
		The three nature-moods are the stuff of the Vedas, but thou, O Urjoona, rise above the three, high beyond the
		dualities, steadfast on the plane of the Light; be careless of getting and having, be a man with a soul.
		As much use as there is in a well, when all the regions are flowing with water, so much is there in all the
		Vedas to the Brahman who hath the Knowledge.
		Thou hast a right to action only, to the fruit of action thou hast no manner of right at all; be not motived by
		the fruits of action, neither to inaction sell thy soul; but put attachment far from thee, O Dhanunjoy, and do
		thy deeds with a mind in Yoga, awaiting success and failure with an equal heart; for ’tis such equipoise of the
		soul that is Yoga indeed.
		For far lower is action than Yoga of the Super-Mind; in the Super-Mind desire thy refuge; for this is a mean and
		pitiful thing that a man should work for success and rewards.
		The man whose Super-Mind is in Yoga casteth from him even in this world both righteousness and sin; therefore to
		Yoga gird thy soul; when thou doest works, Yoga is the one auspicious way.
		For the wise whose understandings have reached God, cast from them the fruit that is born of their deeds, they
		are delivered from the fetters of birth, they pass into the sphere where suffering is not, neither any disease.
		When thy soul shall have voyaged to the other shore over the Chaos of the Great Bewilderment, then shalt thou
		become careless of the Scripture that is and the Scripture that shalt be, and when the mind that is perplexed
		and beaten about by the Scripture shall stand fast and motionless in Samadhi, then shalt thou attain Yoga.</p>

		is self-content in the Self, then is it said of him that the Reason hath taken his seat.
		He whose soul is not shaken in sorrows and in happiness hungereth not after their delight, he to whom fear and
		liking and wrath are forgotten things, he is the Sage the thought in whom is settled.
		He who is in all things without affections whether evil come to him or whether good, who delights not in the
		pleasure neither hateth the pain, he is the man of an established understanding.
		As a tortoise gathereth in its limbs from all sides, so when this understanding Spirit gathereth in the senses
		away from the things in which the senses work, then is the Reason in a man safely seated.
		By fasting and refraining the objects of passion cease from a man but the desire and the delight in them remain,
		but when the embodied Spirit hath beheld the Most High, the very desire and delight cease and are no more.
		For very furious and turbulent are the senses, O son of Coonty, and though a man be Godseeking, though he have
		the soul that discerneth, they seize upon even his mind and ravish it violently away.
		Let a man coerce all these and sit fast in Yoga utterly giving himself up to Me; for only when a man has his
		senses in his grip, is the Reason of him firm in its seat.
		But when a man thinketh much and often of the things of sense, fondness for them groweth upon him, and from
		fondness desire and passion are born; and passion’s child is wrath; but out of wrath cometh delusion and
		disturbance of the brain and from delusion cometh confusion of the recording mind and when memory falleth and
		faileth, the overmind is destroyed, and by the ruin of the overmind the soul goeth to its perdition.

<p class="PE">likings and dislikings, and when the Spirit itself answers to the helm, a pure serenity becometh his.
		In that bright gladness of the soul there cometh to him a waning away of all grief; for when a man’s heart is
		like a calm and pure sky, the Thought findeth very quickly its firm foundation.
		Who hath not Yoga, hath not understanding, who hath not Yoga, hath not infinite and inward contemplation, who
		thinketh not infinitely and inwardly, hath not peace of soul, and how shall he be happy, whose soul is not at
		peace?
		For the mind that followeth the control and working of the senses when they range abroad, hurleth along with it
		the Thought in the Spirit as the wind hurleth along a ship upon the waters.
		Therefore it is, O strong-armed, that his reason is firmly based only whose senses are reined in on all sides

		of Yoga.
		Not by refraining from works shall a man taste actionlessness and not by mere renouncing of the world shall he
		reach perfection.
		For verily no man even for a moment remains without doing, since each is made to do whether he will or not by
		the moods of his essential nature.
		He who coerceth the organs of action and sitteth remembering in his heart the things in which the senses work,
		is a man deceived in Spirit, him they call a hypocrite, but he whosoever governeth the senses with his mind, O
		Urjoona, and entereth on Yoga in works using the organs of action without attachment, is distinguished above all
		beings.
		Do thou the works that the law demands of thee, for action is mightier than inaction; yea without works the very
		maintenance of thy body cannot be.
		’Tis by doing works in other spirit than as a sacrifice that this world of creatures falleth into bondage to its
		works; but do thou practise works as a Sacrifice, O son of Coonty, with a mind free from the yoke of attachment.
		For with Sacrifice as their companion the Father, of old, created all these peoples and said unto them, “By
		Sacrifice shall ye beget offspring; lo the chosen joys of your desire, they shall be to you the milk of her
		udders.
		Cherish you the gods with sacrifice and the gods shall cherish you in turn; thus by cherishing each other shall
		ye attain to your highest welfare.
		Cherished with sacrifice the gods shall bestow on you </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 86</p>
<p class="PE">the joys you most desire and he is no better than a thief who enjoyeth what they give and giveth not
		to them again.”
		The good who eat the remnants of the Sacrifice are delivered from all their transgressions, but those accursed
		eat and drink sin who cook their food but for their own selfish bellies.
		From food all creatures are born and from rain is the birth of food; but rain ariseth from the sacrifice and
		Sacrifice hath its root in works; works know to be born of the Eternal, for by the imperishable word of the
		Eternal they were brought into being.
		Therefore is the Eternal everywhere and in all things; yea He hath His home for ever in the heart of the
		Sacrifice.
		This is the Wheel that God hath set going and who goeth not with it, whose days are a wickedness, whose delight
		and ease are in the senses, O son of Pritha, liveth his life in vain.
		But for the man whose whole pleasure is in the Self and who satisfies his longing with the Self, yea who is
		content utterly with the Self, for him there is no needful action.
		For indeed he hath no end at all to gain by doing neither any by not doing, he hath no dependence for end or aim
		on any or even this whole world of creatures.
		Therefore without attachment do ever the work before thee, since by doing works without attachment man reacheth
		the Highest.
		’Twas by works alone that the men of old reached to utter perfection even Junac and the rest.
		Moreover even if thou lookest to the right government of the world, thou shouldest be doing.
		What they see their Greatest do, even that the rest of the folk will practise, and the standard that the Best
		setteth up, the world will surely follow.
		Behold, O Partha, there is nought at all in the three worlds that I must do, there is nothing I have not or that
		I yet need to win, and still I move in the path of works.
		For verily were I not to move sleeplessly in the path of works, lo men follow utterly the way wherein I tread, O
		son of Pritha, then would all these worlds sink and perish, were I not to do works and I should become the
		creator of bastard confusion and the slayer of all these creatures.
		That which the ignorant do with attachment to the work, O Bharata, the wise man should do without attachment,
		wishing only to keep the world in its traces.
		Let him not be the cause of division and confusion of </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 87</p>
<p class="PE">mind in the ignorant who are attached to their works, but let him, knowing all, set them to all the
		works of this world by doing works in Yoga.
		Lo works are done but by the modes of Nature in her inevitable working, but the Spirit of man is deceived by the
		sense of separate existence and he sayeth in himself “I, even I am the doer.”
		But he who knoweth to the core how the workings of the modes are parcelled out, believeth that the modes work in
		and upon the modes, and suffereth not attachment to seize him.
		Most men are deceived by the modes of Nature, cling to the workings of these modes; these dull brains, these
		imperfect knowers, let not the perfect knower cause to swerve and stumble.
		Repose all thy works upon Me and with thy heart spiritually inclined be desireless, be selfless; then arise,
		fight, O Urjoona, let the fever of thy soul pass from thee.
		For men who with faith and without carping follow ever this my Word are released, they also, from bondage to
		their works, but they who carp at and follow not this my word, know of them that all their knowledge is a
		delusion; their intellect is nought; they are lost men, Urjoona.
		Lo even the wise man who knoweth can but act according to his own essential nature; for to their nature all
		creatures come at last and what shall coercing it avail?
		Only in the field of each and every sense love and hate are there and ever they lie in ambush; let not the
		Spirit of man fall into their clutches for they are his adversaries in his great journey.
		Better is it the rule of thy own life ill done than an alien rule well accomplished, yea death in the path of

		But without Yoga, O great of arm, renunciation is very difficult to arrive at and the sage that hath Yoga
		travelleth very swiftly to God.
		When a man hath Yoga, the self of him is purified from obscuration, he is master [of] the Self and victor over
		the senses; he whose Self has become one with the self of all created things, though he do works, can receive no
		defilement.
		The Yogin sees the reality of things and thinks “Truly I do nothing at all”; yea when he sees or hears or
		touches, when he smells and when he tastes, in his going and in his sleeping and in his breathing, whether he
		talk, whether he put out or take in, whether he close his eyes or open them, still he holds to it, “Lo, ’tis but

		The Lord createth not works nor the authorship of works for His people neither yoketh He them to the fruits of
		their works; ’tis the nature in a man that is busy and taketh its course.
		The Lord taketh to himself the sin of none neither accepteth He the righteousness of any; but Wisdom is clouded
		over with Nescience and ’tis by this that these living beings fall into delusion.
		But on all of those who by Knowledge have destroyed the nescience of the Self, Wisdom riseth like the sun and
		lighteth up that Highest Self of All.
		Then they perceive Him alone and are Self of Him and to Him consecrated in faith and all for Him, and the
		revolving wheel clutches them not in any more, because wisdom hath washed them pure of all stain.
		The Brahmin endowed with learning and modest culture, the cow and the elephant and the very dog and the Pariah,
		all these the wise regard with equal eyes.
		Even in this human life they have conquered this creation whose minds have taken root in that divine equality,
		for the Eternal also is without a defect and He looketh on all his creatures with equal eyes; therefore in the
		Eternal they have their root.
		He is not overjoyed when he getteth what is pleasant, he groweth not troubled when he tasteth bitterness, whose
		reason is firm and steadfast and he subjecteth not himself to delusion but knoweth the Eternal and in him
		abideth.
		His soul clings not to the touches of outward things but what happiness he finds, he finds in the Self,
		therefore his Self is made one in Yoga with Eternal Brahman and the happiness he tastes, does not cease or
		diminish.
		For the enjoyments that are born of touch and contact are very wombs of misery, they begin and they end; the
		wise man taketh no delight in these.
		For he who even on this earth and before his release from this mortal body hath strength to stand up in the
		speed and rush of wrath and lust, he hath Yoga, he is the happy man.
		That man is the Yogin whose bliss is within and his delight and ease are inward and an inner light illumines him

		It is sudden nectar to the desolate to find a friend!<br/>
		Now I rise to smite the foe and cease not till I make an end.”<br/>
		Out he rushed to desperate battle burning in his pride and might,<br/>
		As a noble warhorse wounded rushes faster to the fight.<br/>
		Stung with arrows of her speech he did his mother’s high command<br/>
		Driving out the foe and stranger, freeing all the conquered land.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="blank-verse-rendering">The Birth of the War-God</h1>
<h2 class="sub-hd">Blank Verse Rendering of Canto I</h2>
<p class="PE">A god concealed in mountain majesty,<br/>
		Embodied to our cloudy physical sight<br/>
		In snowy summits and green-gloried slopes,<br/>
		To northward of the many-rivered land<br/>
		Measuring the earth in an enormous ease,<br/>
		Immense Himaloy dwells and in the moan<br/>
		Of eastern ocean and in western floods<br/>
		Plunges his giant sides.
		Him once the hills<br/>
		Imagined as the mighty calf of earth<br/>
		When the Wideness milked her udders; gems brilliant-rayed<br/>
		Were born and herbs on every mountain marge.<br/>
		So in his infinite riches is he dressed,<br/>
		Not all his snows can slay his opulence,<br/>
		And though they chill the feet of heaven, her sons<br/>
		Forget that fault mid all his crowding gifts,<br/>
		As faints in luminous floods the gloomy mark<br/>
		On the moon’s argent disk; they choose his vales<br/>
		For playground, his hill-peaks for divine homes.<br/>
		Brightness of minerals on his rocks is spread<br/>
		Which to the Apsaras give adorning hues<br/>
		In their love-sports and in their dances; flung<br/>
		On the split clouds their brilliant colours ranged,<br/>
		Like an untimely sunset’s glories live.<br/>
		Far down the clouds droop to his girdle-waist;<br/>
		Then by the low-hung plateaus’ coolness drawn<br/>
		The Siddhas in soft shade repose, but flee<br/>
		Soon upward by wild driving rain distressed<br/>
		To summits splendid in the veilless sun.<br/>
		The hunter seeks for traces on his sides,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 264</p>
<p class="PE">And though their reddened footprints are expunged<br/>
		By the new-falling snows, yet can he find<br/>
		The path his prey the mighty lions go;<br/>
		For, it is told, pearls from slain elephants<br/>
		Are clotted, fallen from their hollow claws,<br/>
		And tell their dangerous passage.
		When he rests<br/>
		Tired with the chase and bares to winds his brow,<br/>
		They come, fay-breezes dancing on the slopes,<br/>
		Shaking the cedars on Himaloy’s breast,<br/>
		Scattering the peacock’s gorgeous-plumed attire,<br/>
		With spray of Ganges’ cascades on their wings<br/>
		Sprinkling his hair.
		He makes the grottoed glens<br/>
		His chambers of desire and in the night<br/>
		When the strong forest-wanderer is lain<br/>
		Twined with his love, marrying with hers his sighs,<br/>
		The luminous herbs from the dim banks around,<br/>
		Faint oilless lamps, give light to see her joy.<br/>
		Nor only earthly footsteps tread the grass,<br/>
		Or mortal love finds there its happy scenes.<br/>
		The birch-leaves of the hills love-pages are;<br/>
		Like spots of age upon the tusky kings,<br/>
		In ink of liquid metals letters strange<br/>
		Make crimson signs, pages where passion burns<br/>
		And divine Circes pen heart-moving things.<br/>
		The Kinnars wander singing in his glades.<br/>
		He fills the hollows of his bamboo flutes<br/>
		With the wind rising from his deep ravines,<br/>
		And with a moaning and melodious sound<br/>
		Breathes from his rocky mouths as if he meant<br/>
		To pipe, tune-giver to their minstrelsies.<br/>
		The delicate heels of the maned Kinnari<br/>
		Are by his frosted slabs of snow distressed,<br/>
		Yet for her burden of breasts and heavy hips<br/>
		Can change not their slow motion’s swaying grace<br/>
		To escape the biting pathway’s chill unease.<br/>
		She too in grottoed caverns lies embraced.<br/>
		When from her limbs is plucked the raiment fine</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 265</p>
<p class="PE">Of the Kinnar’s shamefast love, then hanging come<br/>
		The convex clouds across the grotto doors<br/>
		And make chance curtains against mortal eyes,<br/>
		Shielding the naked goddess from our sight.<br/>
		The elephant herds there wander: resinous trees<br/>
		Shaken and rubbed by their afflicting brows<br/>
		Loose down their odorous tears in creamy drops;<br/>
		The winds upon the plateaus burdened pant<br/>
		And make of all the air a scented dream.<br/>
		The yaks are there; they lift their bushy tails<br/>
		And in their lashings scatter gleamings white<br/>
		As moonbeams shed upon the sleeping hills:<br/>
		Brightly they seem to fan the mountain king.<br/>
		He hides in his deep caves the hunted night<br/>
		Fearful of the day’s brilliant eyes.
		His peaks<br/>
		Seem to outpeer the lower-circling sun,<br/>
		Which sends its upward beams as if to wake<br/>
		Immortal lilies in his tarns unplucked<br/>
		By the seven sages in their starry march.<br/>
		Such is Himaloy’s greatness, such his strength<br/>
		That seems to uplift to heaven the earth.
		He bears<br/>
		The honey Soma plant upon his heights,<br/>
		Of godward symbols the exalted source.<br/>
		He by the Master of sacrifice was crowned<br/>
		The ancient monarch of a million hills.<br/>
		In equal rites he to his giant bed<br/>
		The mind-born child of the world-fathers bore.<br/>
		The earthly comrade and the help-fellow<br/>
		Of Meru, their sublime celestial home,<br/>
		Stable of soul, to make a stable race<br/>
		Mena he wed whose wisdom seers adored.<br/>
		Their joy of love was like themselves immense<br/>
		And in the wide felicitous lapse of time<br/>
		Its long and puissant ecstasy bore fruit.<br/>
		Bearing the banner of her unchanged youth<br/>
		And beauty to charmed motherhood she crossed.<br/>
		Mainac she bore, the guest of the deep seas,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 266</p>
<p class="PE">Upon whose peaks the serpent-women play,<br/>
		Their jewelled tresses glittering through the gloom,<br/>
		Race of a cavernous and monstrous world;<br/>
		There fled when Indra tore the mountains’ wings,<br/>
		His divine essence bore no cruel sign,<br/>
		Nor felt the anguish of the lightning’s bite.<br/>
		Next to a nobler load her womb gave place;<br/>
		For Daksha’s daughter, Shiva’s wife, the Lord<br/>
		Of Being, in her angry will who left<br/>
		Her body soulless in her father’s hall,<br/>
		Sought in their mountain home a happier birth,<br/>
		And by her in a trance profound of joy<br/>
		Conceived was born of great Himaloy’s seed.<br/>
		Out of the soul unseen the splendid child<br/>
		Came like success with daring for its sire<br/>
		And for its mother clear-eyed thought sublime.<br/>
		Then were the regions subtle with delight,<br/>
		Soft, pure from cloud and stain; then heaven’s shells<br/>
		Blew sweetly, flowery rain came drifting down,<br/>
		Earth answered to the rapture of the skies<br/>
		And all her moving and unmoving life<br/>
		Felt happiness because the Bride was born.<br/>
		So this fair mother by this daughter shone,<br/>
		So that new beauty radiated its beams<br/>
		As if a land of lapis lazuli<br/>
		Torn by the thunder’s voice shot suddenly forth<br/>
		A jewelled sprouting from the mother bed.<br/>
		Parvati was she called, the mountain’s child,<br/>
		When love to love cried answer in her house<br/>
		And to that sound she turned her lovely face,<br/>
		But after-days the great maternal name<br/>
		Of Uma gave.
		On her as fair she grew<br/>
		Her father banqueted his sateless look;<br/>
		He felt himself a lamp fulfilled in light,<br/>
		Heaven’s silent path by Ganges voiceful made,<br/>
		Or thought made glorious by a perfect word.<br/>
		Like bees that winging come upon the wind</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 267</p>
<p class="PE">Among the infinite sweets of honeyed spring<br/>
		Drawn to the mango-flower’s delicious breast,<br/>
		All eyes sought her.
		Her little childlike form<br/>
		Increasing to new curves of loveliness,<br/>
		She grew like the moon’s arc from day to day.<br/>
		Among her fair companions of delight<br/>
		She built frail walls of heavenly Ganges’ sands<br/>
		Or ran to seize the tossing ball or pleased<br/>
		With puppet children her maternal mind,<br/>
		Absorbed in play, the mother of the worlds.<br/>
		And easily too to her as if in play<br/>
		All sciences and wisdoms crowding came<br/>
		Out of her former life, like swans that haste<br/>
		In autumn to a sacred river’s shores;<br/>
		They started from her mind as grow at night<br/>
		Born from some luminous herb its glimmering rays.<br/>
		To her child-body youth, a charm, arrived<br/>
		Adorning every limb, a wine of joy<br/>
		To intoxicate the heart, the eyes that gazed,<br/>
		Shooting the arrows of love’s curving bow.<br/>
		Even as a painting grows beneath the hand<br/>
		Of a great master, as the lotus opens<br/>
		Its petals to the flatteries of the sun,<br/>
		So into perfect roundness grew her limbs<br/>
		And opened up sweet colour, form and light.<br/>
		Her feet limned a red rose at every step<br/>
		On the enamoured earth; like magic flowers<br/>
		They moved from spot to spot their petalled bloom;<br/>
		Her motion studied from the queenly swans<br/>
		With wanton swaying musically timed<br/>
		The sweet-voiced anklets’ murmurous refrain.<br/>
		From moulded knee to ankle the supreme<br/>
		Divinely lessening curve so lovely was<br/>
		It looked as if on this alone were spent<br/>
		All her Creator’s cunning.
		Well the rest<br/>
		Might tax his labour to build half such grace,<br/>
		Yet was that miracle accomplished.
		Soft</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 268</p>
<p class="PE">In roundness, warm in their smooth sweep her thighs<br/>
		Were without parallel in Nature’s work.<br/>
		The greatness of her hips on which life’s girdle<br/>
		Had found its ample rest deserved already<br/>
		The lap of divine love where she alone<br/>
		Might hope one day embosomed by God to lie.<br/>
		Deep was her navel’s hollow where wound in<br/>
		Above her raiment’s knot that tender line<br/>
		Of down as slight as the dark ray shot up<br/>
		From the blue jewel central in her zone.<br/>
		Her waist was like an altar’s middle small<br/>
		And there the triple stair of love was built.<br/>
		Twin breasts large, lovely, pale with darkened paps<br/>
		Could not allow the slender lotus thread<br/>
		A passage, on whose either side there waited<br/>
		Softer than delicatest flowers the arms<br/>
		Which Love victorious in defeat would find<br/>
		His chains to bow down the Eternal’s neck.<br/>
		Her throat adorned the necklace which it wore;<br/>
		Its sweep and undulation to the breast<br/>
		Outmatched the gleaming roundness of its gems.<br/>
		Above all this her marvellous face where met<br/>
		The golden mother of beauty and delight<br/>
		At once the graces of her lotus throne<br/>
		And the soft lustres of the moon.
		Her smile<br/>
		Parted the rosy sweetness of her lips<br/>
		Like a white flower across a ruddy leaf<br/>
		Or pearls that sever lines of coral.
		Noble<br/>
		Her speech dropped nectar from a liquid voice<br/>
		To which the coïl’s call seemed rude and harsh<br/>
		And sob of smitten lyres a tuneless sound.<br/>
		She had exchanged with the wild woodland deer<br/>
		The startled glance of her long lovely eyes<br/>
		Fluttering like a blue lotus in the wind.<br/>
		The pencilled long line of her arching brows<br/>
		Made vain the beauty of Love’s bow.
		Her hair’s<br/>
		Tossed masses put voluptuously to shame</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 269</p>
<p class="PE">The mane of lions and the drift of clouds.<br/>
		To clasp all beauty in a little space<br/>
		He who created all this wondrous world<br/>
		Had fashioned only her.
		Throned in her limbs<br/>
		All possibilities of loveliness<br/>
		Here crowded to their fair attractive seat<br/>
		And now the artist eyes that scan all things<br/>
		Saw every symbol and sweet parallel<br/>
		Of beauty only realised in her.<br/>
		Then was he satisfied and loved his work.<br/>
		The sages ranging at their will the stars<br/>
		Saw her and knew that this indeed was she<br/>
		Who must become by love the beautiful half<br/>
		Of the fair body of the Lord and all<br/>
		His heart.
		This from the seers of future things<br/>
		Her father heard and his high hope renounced<br/>
		All other but the greatest for her spouse.<br/>
		She waited like an offering for the fire.<br/>
		For to compel himself the divine mind<br/>
		He dared not, but remained like a great soul<br/>
		Which watches for the destined hour’s approach<br/>
		Curbing the impatience of its godlike hopes.<br/>
		But he the spirit of the world, forsaken<br/>
		By that first body of the mother of all<br/>
		Nor to her second birth yet come, abode<br/>
		Unwed, ascetic, stern, mid crowded worlds<br/>
		Alone and passionless and unespoused,<br/>
		The Master of the animal life absorbed<br/>
		In dreamings, wandering with his demon hordes<br/>
		Desireless in the blind desire of things.<br/>
		At length he ceased; like sculptured marble still<br/>
		To meditation turned he yoked his spirit;<br/>
		Clothed in the skins of beasts, with ashes smeared<br/>
		He sat a silent shape upon the hills.<br/>
		Below him curved Himadri’s slope; a soil<br/>
		With fragrance of the musk-deer odorous<br/>
		Was round him, where the awful Splendour mused</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 270</p>
<p class="PE">Mid cedars sprinkled with the sacred dew<br/>
		Of Ganges.
		Softly murmuring their chants<br/>
		In strains subdued the Kinnar minstrels sang,<br/>
		On oil-filled slabs among the resinous herbs<br/>
		His grisly hosts sat down, their bodies stained<br/>
		With mineral unguents, bark upon their limbs;<br/>
		Ill-shaped they were and their tremendous hands<br/>
		Around their ears had wreathed the hillside’s flowers.<br/>
		On the white rocks compact of frozen snow,<br/>
		His great bull voicing low immortal pride<br/>
		Pawed with his hoof the argent soil to dust,<br/>
		Alarmed the bisons fled his gaze; he bellowed<br/>
		Impatient of the mountain lion’s roar.<br/>
		Concentrating his world-vast energies<br/>
		Built daily his eternal shape of flame<br/>
		He who gives all austerities their fruit,<br/>
		In what impenetrable and deep desire?<br/>
		And though to him the worship even of gods<br/>
		Is negligible, worship the mountain gave<br/>
		And gave his daughter the Great Soul to serve.<br/>
		Nor though to remote trance near beauty brings<br/>
		Its lovely danger, was that gift refused.<br/>
		Surrounded by all sweetness in the world<br/>
		He can be passionless who is creation’s king.<br/>
		She brought him daily offering of flowers<br/>
		And holy water morn and noon and eve<br/>
		And swept the altar of the divine fire<br/>
		And heaped his altar-seat of sacred grass,<br/>
		Then bending over his feet her falling locks<br/>
		Drowned all her soft fatigue of gentle toil<br/>
		In the cool moonbeams from the Eternal’s head.<br/>
		So had they met on summits of the world<br/>
		Like the still Spirit and its unwakened force,<br/>
		Near were they now, yet to each other unknown,<br/>
		He meditating, she in service bowed.<br/>
		Closing awhile her vast and shining lids<br/>
		Fate over them paused suspended on the hills.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="T-1452">A god concealed in mountain majesty,<br/>
		Embodied to our cloudy physical sight<br/>
		In dizzy summits and green-gloried slopes,<br/>
		Measuring the earth in an enormous ease,<br/>
		Immense Himaloy dwells and in the moan<br/>
		Of western waters and in eastern floods<br/>
		Plunges his hidden spurs.
		Of such a strength<br/>
		High-piled, so thousand-crested is his look<br/>
		That with the scaling greatness of his peaks<br/>
		He seems to uplift to heaven our prostrate soil.<br/>
		He mounts from the green luxury of his vales<br/>
		Ambitious of the skies; naked and lost<br/>
		The virgin chill immensity of snow<br/>
		Covers the breathless spirit of his heights.<br/>
		To snows his savage pines aspire; the birch<br/>
		And all the hardy brotherhood which climb<br/>
		Against the angry muttering of the winds,<br/>
		Challenge the dangerous air in which they live.<br/>
		He is sated with the silence of the stars:<br/>
		Lower he dips into life’s beauty, far<br/>
		Below he hears the cascades, now he clothes<br/>
		His rugged sides the gentle breezes kiss<br/>
		With soft grass and the gold and silver fern.<br/>
		Holding upon her breast the hill-god’s feet<br/>
		Earth in her tresses hides his giant knees.<br/>
		Over lakes of mighty sleep, where fountains lapse,<br/>
		Dreaming, and by the noise of waterfalls,<br/>
		In an unspoken solitary joy</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 272</p>
<p class="PE">He listens to her chant.
		The distant hills<br/>
		Imagined him the calf to which she lows<br/>
		When the wideness milks her udders.
		Meru is near,<br/>
		The heavenly unseen height; like visible hints<br/>
		Of his great subtle growths of peace and joy<br/>
		Her musing woods arise; gems brilliant-rayed<br/>
		She bears and herbs on every mountain marge,<br/>
		Gifts of the mother to her mighty child.<br/>
		In such warm infinite riches has she dressed<br/>
		His fire of life, from his cold heights of thought<br/>
		The great snows cannot slay its opulence.<br/>
		Though stark they chill the feet of heaven, her sons<br/>
		Forgive the fault amid a throng of joys.<br/>
		As faints from our charmed sense in luminous floods<br/>
		The gloomy stain on the moon’s argent disk,<br/>
		They have forgot his chill severity<br/>
		In sweetness which escapes from him on life.<br/>
		For as from passion of some austere soul<br/>
		Delight and love have stolen to rapturous birth,<br/>
		From iceborn waters his delicious vales<br/>
		Are fed.
		Indulgent like a smile of God,<br/>
		White grandeurs overlook wild green romance.<br/>
		He keeps his summits for immortal steps.<br/>
		The life of man upon his happier slopes<br/>
		Roams wild and bare and free; the life of gods<br/>
		Pronely from the unattainable summits climbs<br/>
		Down the rude greatness of his huge rock-park.<br/>
		As if rejecting glory of its veils<br/>
		It leaps out from the subtle gleam of air,<br/>
		Visible to man by waterfall and glade,<br/>
		And finds us in the hush of sleeping woods,<br/>
		And meets us with dim whisperings in the night.<br/>
		Of their surrounding presence unaware<br/>
		Chasing the dreadful wanderers of the hill<br/>
		The hunter seeks for traces on his side;<br/>
		He though soft-falling innocent snows weep off<br/>
		The cruelty of their red footprints, finds</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 273</p>
<p class="PE">The path his prey the mighty lions go.<br/>
		For glittering pearls from the felled elephants<br/>
		Lain clotted, dropping from the hollow claws<br/>
		Betray their dangerous passage.
		When he sits<br/>
		Tired of the hunt on a slain poplar’s base<br/>
		And bares to winds the weariness of his brow,<br/>
		They come, fay-breezes dancing on the slopes,<br/>
		Scattering the peacock’s gorgeous-plumed attire.<br/>
		Shaking the cedars on Himaloy’s breast,<br/>
		With spray from Ganges’ cascades on their wings,<br/>
		They have kissed the wind-blown tangles of his hair,<br/>
		Sprinkling their coolness on his soul.
		He has made<br/>
		The grottoed glens his chambers of desire,<br/>
		He has packed their dumbness with his passionate bliss;<br/>
		Stone witnesses of ecstasy they sleep.<br/>
		And wonderful luminous herbs from night’s dim banks<br/>
		When the strong forest-wanderer is lain<br/>
		Twined with his love, marrying with hers his sighs,<br/>
		Give light to see her joy those thrilled rocks keep<br/>
		Moved to desire in their stony dreams.<br/>
		Nor only human footsteps tread the grass<br/>
		Upon his slopes, nor only mortal love<br/>
		Finds there the lovely setting of the hills<br/>
		Amid the broken caverns and the trees,<br/>
		In the weird moonlight pouring from the clouds<br/>
		And the clear sunlight glancing from the pines:<br/>
		A wandering choir, a flash of unseen forms,<br/>
		Go sweeping sometimes by and leave our hearts<br/>
		Startled with hintings of a greater life.<br/>
		The Kinnar passes singing in his glades.<br/>
		Then stirred to keep some sweetness of their voice,<br/>
		He fills the hollows of his bamboo stems<br/>
		With the wind sobbing from the deep ravines<br/>
		And in a moaning and melodious sound<br/>
		Breathes from his rocky mouths, as if he meant<br/>
		To flute, tune-giver to wild minstrelsies.<br/>
		The delicate heels of the maned Kinnari</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 274</p>
<p class="PE">Are with his frosted slabs of snow distressed.<br/>
		But by the large load of her breasts and hips<br/>
		To escape the biting pathway’s chill unease<br/>
		She is forbidden: she must not break the grace<br/>
		Of her slow motion’s tardy rich appeal.<br/>
		She too in grottoed caverns lies embraced.<br/>
		Forced from the shamefast sweetness of her limbs<br/>
		The subtle raiment leaves her fainting hands<br/>
		To give her striving beauty to the gaze<br/>
		Of her eternal lover.
		But thick clouds<br/>
		Stoop hastily bowed to the rocky doors<br/>
		And hang chance curtains against mortal eyes,<br/>
		Shielding the naked goddess from our sight.<br/>
		The birch-leaves of his hills love-pages are.<br/>
		In ink of liquid metals letters strange<br/>
		We see make crimson signs.
		They lie in wait<br/>
		Upon the slopes, pages where passion burns,<br/>
		The flushed epistles of enamoured gods<br/>
		Where divine Circes pen heart-moving things.<br/>
		The Apsaras rhyme out their wayward dance<br/>
		In glen and valley; or upon brown banks<br/>
		They lie close-bosomed of colour amorous.<br/>
		The smooth gold of their limbs by harder hues<br/>
		Stained curiously makes contrasts bright, to seize<br/>
		The straying look of some world-lover’s eyes,<br/>
		As when Himaloy’s metals flinging back<br/>
		Upon the hangings of the tawny heavens<br/>
		From glistened rocks their brilliant colourings<br/>
		Like an untimely sunset’s glories sleep.<br/>
		Far down the clouds droop to his girdle-waist<br/>
		Holding the tearful burden of their hearts,<br/>
		Drifting grey melancholy through the air;<br/>
		There on the low-hung plateaus’ wideness lain<br/>

		To build frail walls on Ganges’ heavenly sands,<br/>
		Or ran to seize the tossing ball, or pleased<br/>
		With puppet children her maternal mind.<br/>
		And easily out of that earlier time<br/>

		Her smile<br/>
		Parted the rosy sweetness of her lips<br/>
		Like candid pearls severing soft coral lines<br/>

		Her speech dropped nectar from a liquid voice<br/>

		<b>अभिलषिताः</b>.
		I do not understand on what principle of grammar the Avachuri followed by Deshpande takes this form as =
		<b>मनोऽभिलाषदात्र्यः</b>, “desired” taking the sense of “able” or “thought able to fulfil desire”.
		This is but one more instance of the blameable<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="108" href="#">19</a> slovenliness of
		this commentary.
		Adopting this untenable rendering these commentators further suppose that the gods in the house are to be
		worshipped by Parvati for the purpose of gaining Siva as her husband.
		But it is difficult to see how other gods could give her the Supreme, and in any case <b>मनीषिता</b> can only
		mean “desired”, which renders this version impossible.
		But desired by whom?
		If by Parvati, we must suppose Mena to imagine her daughter aiming simply at making a good match in the
		celestial world.
		The sense will then be “Thou desirest a God in marriage; well, there are gods in our home whom thou canst win by
		easy adoration, while Siva must be wooed by harsh asceticism in the woods.”
		Or it may signify “desired generally, desired by others”, when it will have the force of desirable.
		This is supported by the later <b>इयं महेन्द्रप्रभृतीनधिश्रियश्चतुर्दिगीशानवमत्य मानिनी</b> and Siva Purana.
		I prefer therefore the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="109" href="#">20</a> latter interpretation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="110" href="#">21</a>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1482"><b>गृहेषु</b>.

<p class="P" search_id="T-1484">A similar rendering is also favoured by another passage of the same Purana.</p>

			सदा ॥</b></p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1486">It is perhaps a reminiscence of these lines that induces the Avachuri and Deshpande to render
		“Worship<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="117" href="#">28</a> the gods in the house to gain Siva for husband”; but
		this is incompatible with <b> मनीषिताः</b>.
		If the Siva Purana<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="118" href="#">29</a> then were Kalidasa’s authority, we should have
		no choice as to our interpretation, but I have tried to show that the Siva Purana and not Kalidasa was the
		borrower.
		It is possible therefore that the former may in borrowing have misinterpreted <b> गृहेषु</b> and that the word
		has a strictly plural sense.
		“There are gods desired that dwell in homes,” i.e. not like the undesirable and homeless Siva, who must be
		sought by austerity in wild woods and desolate mountains.
		The only objection to this rendering which certainly gives the best and most poetic sense, is that the contrast
		with Siva is implied and not expressed, while <b> तपः</b> immediately following seems to be opposed to household
		worship.
		But Mena under the circumstances would not venture openly to dispraise Siva; implied dispraise therefore is what
		we should naturally expect.
		Such suppression of the implied contrast, one term expressed and the other left to be gathered is not in itself
		unpoetic and might be expected in a work written under the strong influence of the elliptical and suggestive
		style of the Mahabharata.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1487">The reading <b>गृहेऽपि</b> would of course leave no doubt; it confines us to our first rendering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1488"><b>क्व</b> . . . <b> क्व</b>.
		Again the characteristic Sanscrit idiom implying <b> महदन्तरं</b> “a far cry”.
		It is a far cry from your tender body to the harshness of ascetic austerities.
		Notice again the fine precision, the netteté of Kalidasa’s style; there are no epithets with <b>तपः</b> and
		<b>वपुः</b>, these being sufficiently implied in the contrasting <b>क्व</b>. . . <b>क्व</b> and in the simile

<p class="P" search_id="T-1493"><b>ध्रुवेच्छाम्</b>.
		The reading <b>व्रतेच्छाम्</b> is weak and <b> श्रुतेच्छाम्</b> absolutely without force.
		Neither is noticed by Mallinatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="123" href="#">34</a>.
		The point of course is the unspeakable fixity of her resolve and not its object.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1494"><b>नियन्तुमुद्यमात्</b>.
		The delicate etymological assonance is a fine survival of one of Kalidasa’s favourite rhetorical artifices.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1495"><b>उद्यमात्</b>.
		This word is variously taken in various contexts.
		S here renders by <b> उत्साह</b>, Apte by “fixed resolve” and Deshpande by “undertaking”, whereas Mallinatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="124" href="#">35</a> consistently renders by <b> उद्योग</b>.
		It is as well therefore to fix its exact meaning.
		The root <b> यम्</b> meaning to put under a strain<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="125" href="#">36</a> with
		<b>उद्</b> “up” in an intensive, implies the strain put on the faculties in preparing for or making a great
		effort.
		It means therefore “active effort or endeavour” or else “active preparation”.
		In this latter sense Apte quotes <b>गन्तुमुद्यमो विहितः</b> = Preparations to go were taken order for.
		In sloka 3 the dative <b> तपसे</b> having the same force as an infinitive leads us to prefer this meaning;
		“effort towards austerity” has no meaning [in] the context.
		I think in this sloka, it has as Mallinatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="126" href="#">37</a> perceived, the same
		sense; Uma is still in the stage of preparation, and is not yet even ready to ask her father’s consent.
		Effort or endeavour would therefore be obviously out of place.
	</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 299</p>
<p class="PE"> Now these are the only two ascertained senses of <b>उद्यम</b>.
		The sense of <b> उत्साह</b> or undertaking cannot be established and is not recognised by Apte.
		That of “perseverance”, “fixed resolve” given to it by Kv<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="127" href="#">38</a> in
		sloka 3 and by Apte here, seems to me equally without authority; I believe there is no passage in which
		<b>उद्यमः</b> occurs where it cannot be rendered by “effort, labour” or preparation.
		Here moreover Mr. Apte is obviously wrong, for the sense of “fixed resolve” has already been given by
		<b>ध्रुवेच्छाम्</b> and Kalidasa is never tautologous, never expresses the same thing twice over in a line.
		Perhaps he intends us to take his next quotation, from the Punchatuntra<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="128" href="#">39</a>, in this sense <b>उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः ।</b> But the opposite to
		<b>मनोरथाः</b> desires is obviously not “perseverance” but “effort”.
		“It is by active effort and not by mere desires that accomplishment is reached.”

		<b>पयः</b> the general is here obviously used for <b>प्रवाह</b> the particular.

<p class="P" search_id="T-1497"><b>प्रतीपयेत्</b>.
		The commentaries take in the sense of “turn back”, most definitely expressed by S, पश्चात्कश्चालयेत्<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130" href="#">41</a>.
		Mallinatha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="131" href="#">42</a> recognising that <b>प्रतीपयेत्</b> primarily means <b>
			प्रतिकूलयेत्</b> oppose, gives that sense and deduces from it <b> प्रतिनिवर्तयेत्</b>.
		Apte also quotes this passage to establish this sense of <b> प्रतीपय</b>.
		This of course is taking <b>प्रतीपय</b> = <b> प्रतीपं कृ</b>, <b>प्रतीप</b> being “reverse, inverted”, e.g. 2.25
		<b>अम्भसामोघसंरोधः प्रतीपगमनादिव</b> (<b>अनुमीयते</b>) <b> ।</b> But <b>प्रतीप</b> also and primarily means
		adverse, hostile, so <b>प्रतीपयति</b> = <b> प्रतीपः भवति</b> be hostile to, oppose.
		It might possibly be taken in this sense here, without Mallinatha’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="132" href="#">43</a> deduction of “turn back”; the general nature of the proposition justifying the more general
		sense.</p>

		<b>मनोरथ</b> means here not her desire for Siva, but her desire to practise austerity as a means of winning

		Parvati wisely waited till the news of this intention had travelled to her father and he had had time<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="136" href="#">47</a> to get accustomed to it and think it over.

		The meaning conveyed is that the movements of the necklace had already rubbed off the sandal paste from her
		breasts which otherwise she would have had to refuse herself as being a piece of luxury incompatible with
		<b>तपः</b>.
		Some of the commentators take <b>यष्टि</b> as meaning “her slender figure”; “the necklace which owing to the
		restlessness of her slender body had rubbed off the sandalpaste.”
		But to take <b> विलोलयष्टि</b> = <b>यष्टिविलोलता</b> (<b>चञ्चलाङ्गतया</b> A) is very awkward and in any case it
		is extremely doubtful whether <b> यष्टिः</b> by itself could mean <b>अङ्गयष्टिः</b>.
		I should therefore reject this rendering which as far as significance goes one might perhaps prefer.
		If we take <b>यष्टि</b> in this sense, it is better to adopt the reading <b> अहार्यनिश्चयाविलोलयष्टिः</b>,
		understand not <b>विलोलयष्टिः</b> with J [<em>Jinasamudrasuri</em>] for that would be merely an ornamental
		epithet, but <b>अविलोलयष्टिः</b> “She put off her necklace, having rubbed off the sandalpaste, and her slender

		Deshpande singularly supposes that this may mean formerly, i.e. always kept away from.
		Such a rendering, if possible, would be wholly out of place and meaningless.
		The difficulty as regards the first line is avoided by supposing it meant that her lip was naturally too red to
		need artificial colouring or that her maidens did the colouring for her.
		This is most jejune and artificial, nor has such a detail the slightest appropriateness in the context.
		As regards the ball it is explained that her hand was too tender to play with it!!
		This is not only jejune, it is laughable.
		Kalidasa could<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="159" href="#">70</a> never have perpetrated such an absurd conceit.
		Even if there were no other objections the absence of a word indicating past time would dispose of the
		rendering; for <b> निवर्तितः</b> is the causal of <b>वृत्</b> with <b> नि</b>.
		Now the simple <b>निवृत्तः</b> means “cessation from <b>प्रवृत्ति</b>, i.e. from any habit of mind, practice or
		course of action; turning away from something it had been turned to”.
		<b>निवर्तितः</b> therefore obviously means “caused to cease from, turned from”.
		It cannot possibly have the sense of “never busied with”; but means “ceasing to be busy with”.
		Kalidasa is speaking in these stanzas of Uma putting off all her former girlish habits for those appropriate to
		asceticism; to suppose that he brings in matter foreign to the idea in hand is to suppose that he is not
		Kalidasa.
		And to interpret “She never used to colour her lips or play at ball and she now plucked kusha-grass and counted
		a rosary” introduces such foreign matter, substitutes non-sequence for sequence and ruins the balanced
		Kalidasian structure of these stanzas.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="prefatory-note">Prefatory Note on Bhartrihari<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="181-1" href="#">1</a></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1646">Bhartrihari’s Century of Morals (Nitishataka), a series of poetical epigrams or rather
		<em>sentences</em> upon human life and conduct grouped loosely round a few central ideas, stands as the first of
		three similar works by one Master.
		Another Century touches with a heavy hand Sringar, sexual attraction; the third expresses with admirable beauty
		of form and intensity of feeling the sentiment of Vairagya, Worlddisgust, which, before and since Buddha, has
		figured so largely in Indian life.
		In a striking but quite superficial manner these brief stanzas remind us of the Greek epigram in the most
		masterly hands: Mimnermus, Simonides; but their spirit and the law of their internal structure relate them
		rather to a type of literature peculiarly Asiatic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1647">Classical Sanscrit literature, as a whole, is governed by an inner stress of spirit which urges it to a
		sort of lucid density of literary structure; in style a careful blending of curious richness with concentrated
		force and directness of expression, in thought and matter a crowded vividness and pregnant lucidity.
		The poet used one of the infinite harmonic variations of the four-lined stanza with which our classical prosody
		teems, or else the couplet called Arya, noble verse; and within these narrow limits he sought to give vividly
		some beautiful single picture, some great or apposite thought, some fine-edged sentiment.
		If a picture, it might be crowded with felicitous detail; if a thought, with pregnant suggestion; if a
		sentiment, with happy shades </p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-181-1"><sup>1</sup><em> Sri Aurobindo wrote this essay to serve as a preface to his
				translation of Bhartrihari’s
				Nitishataka, called by him first “The Century of Morals” and later “The Century of
				Life”. When he published the translation in 1924, he substituted the translator’s note
				reproduced on page 314 for this more elaborate prefatory note, which is reproduced
				here as an appendix.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="p-num">Page 369</p>
<p class="PE">of feeling; but the whole must be perfectly lucid and firm in its unity.
		If these qualities were successfully achieved, the result was a Subhashita, a thing well said and therefore
		memorable.
		Sometimes the Subhashita clarified into a simple epigram, sometimes it overcharged itself with curious
		felicities, but the true type lay between the extremes.
		Similar tendencies are noticeable in the best Indian artwork in ivory, wood and metal, and even enter its
		architecture with that spirit which passed into the Moguls and informing new shapes of loveliness created the
		Taj.
		Many a small Hindu temple is a visible Subhashita in stone.
		In India of the classical times the tendency was so strong that poems of considerable magnitude like Kalidasa’s
		Race of Raghou or Magha’s Slaying of Shishupala are for the most part built up of stanzas on this model; in
		others there are whole passages which are merely a succession of Subhashitas, so that the account of a battle or
		a city scene affects us like a picture gallery and a great speech moves past in a pomp of high-crested armoured
		thoughts.
		A successful Subhashita of the highest type is for all the world as if some great ironclad sailing solitary on
		the limitless ocean were to turn its arc-light on a passing object; in the brilliant concentrated flood of
		lustre a small vessel is revealed; we see the masts, funnel, rails, decks, the guns in their positions, men
		standing on the deck, an officer on the bridge, every detail clear in the strange artificial lustre; next moment
		the light is shut off and the scene, relapsing into darkness, is yet left bitten in on the brain.
		There is the same instantaneous concentration of vision, the same carefully-created luminousness and crowded
		lucidity of separate detail in the clear-cut unity of the picture.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1648">But the Subhashita is not peculiar to India, it pervades Asia.
		The most characteristic verse of China and Japan is confined to this style; it seems to have overmastered
		Arabian poetry; that it is common in Persian the Rubaiyat of Omar and the writings of Hafiz and Sadi would
		appear to indicate.
		In India itself we find the basis of the style in some of the Upanishads, although the structure there is more
		flexible and flowing, not yet trained to the armoured compactness of classic diction.
		Subsequently the only class of writing which the spirit of the Subhashita did </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 370</p>
<p class="PE">not invade, was that great mass of epic and religious literature which made its appeal to the many and
		not to the cultured few.
		In the Mahabharat, Ramayan and the Puranas we have the grand natural stream of Hindu poetry flowing abundantly
		through plain and valley, not embanked and bunded by the engineer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1649">Kalidasa and Bhartrihari are the two mightiest masters of the characteristic classical style as it was
		at its best, before it degenerated into over-curiosity.
		Tradition tells us they were contemporaries.
		It is even said that Bhartrihari was an elder brother of Vikramaditya, Kalidasa’s patron,– not of course Harsha
		of the sixth century to whom European scholarship has transferred the distinction, but the half-mythical founder
		of Malava power in the first century before Christ.
		To account for the succession of a younger brother, the old and common story of the fruit that changed hands
		till it returned disastrously to the first giver, is saddled on the great moralist.
		King Bhartrihari understood that his beloved wife was unfaithful to him, and, overwhelmed by the shock, fell
		wholly under the influence of Vairagya, abandoned his crown to Vikrama and sought the forest in the garb of an
		anchorite.
		The second stanza of the Century of Morals commemorates the unhappy discovery.
		But the epigram has no business in that place and it is doubtful whether it has a personal application; the
		story itself is an evident fiction.
		On the other hand the notion of some European scholars that Bhartrihari was a mere compiler of other people’s
		Subhashitas, is not much better inspired.
		Undoubtedly, spurious verses were introduced and a few bear the mark of their extraneous origin; but I think no
		one who has acquired a feeling for Sanscrit style or is readily responsive to the subtle spirit in poetry can
		fail to perceive that the majority are by one master-craftsman.
		The question is for those to decide who have learned to feel the shades of beauty and peculiarities of tinge in
		words (a quite different thing from shades of meaning and peculiarities of use) and to regard them not as verbal
		counters or grammatical formations but as living things.
		Without this subtle taste for words the finer personal elements of style, those which do not depend on general
		principles of structure, cannot be well-appreciated.
		There are collections </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 371</p>
<p class="PE">of Subhashitas in plenty, but the style of Bhartrihari is a distinct style and the personality of
		Bhartrihari is a distinct personality.
		There is nothing of that infinite variety of tone, note, personal attitude – I do not refer to mere shiftings of
		standpoint and inconsistencies of opinion – which stamp a collection; there is one characteristic tone, a note
		strong and unmistakeable, the persistent self-repetition of an individual manner.
		All is mint of a single mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1650">Bhartrihari’s Centuries are important to us as the finished expression of a thoroughly typical Aryan
		personality in the most splendid epoch of Indian culture.
		The most splendid, not the best; for the vigorous culture mirrored in the epics has been left behind; the nobly
		pure, strong and humane civilisation which produced Buddha gives way to a civilisation a little less humane,
		much less masculine, infinitely less pure, yet richer, more variously coloured, more delightful to the taste and
		senses; the millennium of philosophy and heroism yields to the millennium of luxury and art.
		Of the new civilisation Kalidasa is the perfect and many-sided representative; he had the receptive, alchemistic
		imagination of the great world-poets, Shakespeare, Homer and Valmekie, and everything that was in his world he
		received into that alembic with a deep creative delight and transmuted into forms and sounds of magical beauty.
		Bhartrihari’s was a narrower mind and intenser personality.
		He represents his age in those aspects which powerfully touched his own individual life and character, but to
		others, not having catholicity of moral temper, he could not respond.
		He was evidently a Kshatriya; for all his poetry breathes that proud, grandiose, arrogantly noble spirit of the
		old magnanimous Indian aristocracy, extreme in its selfassertion, equally extreme in its self-abnegation, which
		made the ancient Hindu people one of the three or four great peoples of antiquity.
		The savour of the Kshatriya spirit in Bhartrihari is of the most personal, intimate kind, not the purely poetic
		and appreciative delight of Kalidasa.
		It is with him grain of character, not mere mental impression.
		It expresses itself even in his Vairagya by the fiery and ardent, almost fierce spirit which inspires his
		asceticism,– how different from the fine quietism of the Brahmin!
	</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 372</p>
<p class="PE">But the Century of World-disgust, although it contains some of his best poetry, is not to us his most
		characteristic and interesting work; we find that rather in the Century of Morals.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1651">This Century is an admirable, if incomplete poetic rendering of the great stock of morality which our
		old writers summarised in the one word Arya,– Aryan, noble.
		The word Arya has been thought to correspond very closely to the English idea of a gentleman,– inaccurately, for
		its conception is larger and more profound in moral content.
		Arya and Anarya correspond in their order of ideas partly to the totality indicated by the word,
		<em>gentleman</em>, and its opposite, partly to the conceptions knightly and unknightly, partly to the qualities
		suggested in an English mind by the expressions English and unEnglish as applied to conduct.
		The Aryan man is he who observes in spirit and letter the received code of a national morality which included
		the higher niceties of etiquette, the bold and chivalrous temper of a knightly and martial aristocracy, the
		general obligations of truth, honour and high feeling, and, crowning all, such great ideals of the Vedic and
		Buddhistic religion,– sweetness, forbearance, forgiveness, charity, self-conquest, calm, self-forgetfulness,
		self-immolation – as had entered deeply into the national imagination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1652">The ideas of the Century of Morals are not in themselves extraordinary, nor does Bhartrihari, though he
		had a full share of the fine culture of his age, appear to have risen in intellectual originality beyond the
		average level; it is the personality which appears in the Centuries that is striking.
		Bhartrihari is, as Matthew Arnold would have said, in the grand style.
		He has the true heroic turn of mind and turn of speech; he breathes a large and puissant atmosphere.
		High-spirited, high-minded, high of temper, keen in his sympathies, admiring courage, firmness and daring
		aspiration above all things, thrilling to impulses of humanity, kindliness and self-sacrifice in spite of his
		rugged strength, dowered with a trenchant power of scorn and sombre irony, and occasionally of stern invective,
		but sweetening this masculine severity of character with varied culture and the old high Indian worship of
		knowledge, goodness and wisdom, such is the man who emerges from the one hundred and odd verses of </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 373</p>
<p class="PE">the Shataka.
		The milder and more feminine shades of the Aryan ideal he does not so clearly typify.
		We have often occasion to ask ourselves, What manner of men did the old Aryan discipline, uniting with the new
		Helleno-Asiatic culture, succeed in producing?
		Bhartrihari is at least one type of its products.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1653">And yet in the end a doubt breaks in.
		Was he altogether of his age?
		Was he not born in an alien time and an evil day?
		He would have been better at home, one fancies, with the more masculine temper depicted in the Mahabharata.
		Certainly he ended in disgust and fled for refuge to ascetic imaginations not wholly characteristic of his time.
		He had lived the life of courts, was perhaps an official of high standing and seems to have experienced fully
		the affronts, uncertainties, distastes to which such a career has always been exposed.
		From the beginning stray utterances point to a growing dissatisfaction and in the end there comes the poignant
		cry of a thwarted life.
		When we read the Century of Passion, we seem to come near the root of his malady.
		As in the earlier Century he has subdued to the law of poetical form the ethical aspects of life, so now will he
		deal with the delight of the senses; but how little of real delight there is in this misnamed Century of
		Passion!
		Bhartrihari is no real lover, certainly; but neither is he a genuine voluptuary.
		Of that keen-edged honey-laden delight in the joy of the senses and the emotions which thrills through every
		line of Kalidasa’s Cloud, there is no faintest trace.
		Urged into voluptuous experience by fashion and habit, this high and stern nature had no real vocation for the
		life of the senses; in this respect, and who shall say in how many others, he was out of harmony with the moral
		atmosphere of his times, and at last turned from it all to cry aloud the holy name of Shiva by the waters of the
		pure and ancient river, the river Ganges, while he waited impatiently for the great release....
		But this too was not his vocation.
		He had too much defiance, fire, self-will for the ascetic.
		To have fallen in the forefront of ancient heroic battle or to have consummated himself in some grandiose act of
		self-sacrifice, this would have been his life’s fitting fulfilment, the true end of Bhartrihari.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 374</p>
<p class="PE">The edition followed in the main is that of Mr. Telang in the Bombay Sanscrit Series.
		The accepted order of the verses, although it admits a few gross errors and misplacements, has nevertheless been
		preserved.
		All the Miscellaneous Epigrams at the end have been omitted from the rendering;<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="182" href="#">2</a> and three others, the 90th which has crept in from the Shakuntala of Kalidasa, the 104th
		which is an inferior version of an earlier epigram and the 18th which has come down to us in a hopelessly
		corrupt condition.
		The 27th epigram occurs in the Mudrarakshasa but has been admitted as it is entirely in Bhartrihari’s spirit and
		manner and may have been copied into the play.
		Some other verses which do not bear internal evidence of Bhartrihari’s authorship in their style and spirit,
		have yet been given the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1654">The principle of translation followed has been to preserve faithfully the thought, spirit and images of
		the original, but otherwise to take the full licence of a poetical rendering.
		In translation from one European tongue into another a careful literalness may not be out of place, for the
		genius, sentence structure and turns of thought of European languages are not very dissimilar; they belong to
		one family.
		But the gulf between Sanscrit and English in these respects is very wide, and any attempt at close verbal
		rendering would be disastrous.
		I have made no attempt to render the distinctive features of Bhartrihari’s style; on the contrary I have
		accepted the necessity of substituting for the severity and compact massiveness of Sanscrit diction which must
		necessarily vanish in translation, the greater richness and colour preferred by the English tongue.
		Nor have I attempted to preserve the peculiar qualities of the Subhashita; Bhartrihari’s often crowded couplets
		and quatrains have been perforce dissolved into a looser and freer style and in the process have sometimes
		expanded to considerable dimensions.
		Lines of cunningly wrought gold have had to be beaten out into some tenuity.
		Otherwise the finer associations and suggestions of the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 375</p>
<p class="PE">original would have been lost or blurred.
		I hold it more pardonable in poetical translation to unstring the language than to dwarf the spirit and mutilate
		the thought.
		For in poetry it is not the verbal substance that we seek from the report or rendering of foreign masterpieces;
		we desire rather the spiritual substance, the soul of the poet and the soul of his poetry.
		We cannot hear the sounds and rhythms loved and admired by his countrymen and contemporaries; but we ask for as
		many as we can recover of the responses and echoes which that ancient music set vibrating in the heavens of
		their thought.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="T-1850">In this interminable, impenetrable wilderness of blind gloom, it is night.

<p class="PE">It was a summer day of the Bengali year 1176.
				The glare and heat of the sun lay very heavy on the village of Padchinha.
				The village was crowded with houses, yet there was not a man to be seen.
				Line upon line of shops in the bazaar, row upon row of booths in the mart, hundreds of earthen houses
				interspersed with stone mansions high and low in every quarter.
				But today all was silent.
				In the bazaar the shops are closed, and where the shopkeeper has fled no man can tell.
				It is market day today, but in the mart there is no buying and selling.
				It is the beggars’ day but the beggars are not out.
				The weaver has shut up his loom and lies weeping in his house; the trader has forgotten his traffic and
				weeps with his infant in his lap; the givers have left giving and the teachers closed their schools; the
				very infant, it would seem, has no longer heart to cry aloud.
				No wayfarers are to be seen in the highways, no bathers in the lake, no human forms at door and
				threshold, no birds in the trees, no cattle in the pastures, only in the burning-ground dog and jackal
				crowd.
				In that crowded desolation of houses one huge building whose great fluted pillars could be seen from
				afar, rose glorious as the peak of a hill.
				And yet where was the glory?
				The doors were shut, the house empty of the concourse of men, hushed and voiceless, difficult even to
				the entry of the wind.
				In a room within this dwelling where even noon was a darkness, in that darkness, like a pair of lilies
				flowering in the midnight, a wedded couple sat in thought.
				Straight in front of them stood Famine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1857">The harvest of the year 1174 had been poor, consequently in the year 1175 rice was a little
				dear; the people suffered, but the Government exacted its revenues to the last fraction of a farthing.
				As a result of this careful reckoning the poor began to eat only once a day.
				The rains in 1175 were copious and people thought Heaven had taken pity on the land.
				Joyously once more </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 474</p>
<p class="PE">the herdsman sang his ditty in the fields, the tiller’s wife again began to tease her husband
				for a silver bracelet.
				Suddenly in the month of Aswin Heaven turned away its face.
				In Aswin and Kartik not a drop of rain fell; the grain in the fields withered and turned to straw as it
				stood.
				Wherever an ear or two flourished, the officials bought it for the troops.
				The people no longer had anything to eat.
				First they stinted themselves of one meal in the day, then even from their single meal they rose with
				half-filled stomachs, next the two meal-times became two fasts.
				The little harvest reaped in Chaitra was not enough to fill the hungry mouths.
				But Mahomed Reza Khan, who was in charge of the revenues, thought fit to show himself off as a loyal
				servant and immediately enhanced the taxes by ten per cent.
				Throughout Bengal arose a clamour of great weeping.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1858">First, people began to live by begging, but afterwards who could give alms?
				They began to fast.
				Next they fell into the clutch of disease.
				The cow was sold, plough and yoke were sold, the seed-rice was eaten, hearth and home were sold, land
				and goods were sold.
				Next they began to sell their girls.
				After that they began to sell their boys.
				After that they began to sell their wives.
				Next girl, boy, or wife,– who would buy?
				Purchasers there were none, only sellers.
				For want of food men began to eat the leaves of trees, they began to eat grass, they began to eat weeds.
				The lower castes and the forest men began devouring dogs, mice and cats.
				Many fled, but those who fled only reached some foreign land to die of starvation.
				Those who remained ate uneatables or subsisted without food till disease took hold of them and they
				died.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1859">Disease had its day,– fever, cholera, consumption, smallpox.
				The virulence of smallpox was especially great.
				In every house men began to perish of the disease.
				There was none to give water to his fellow, none who would touch him, none to treat the sick.
				Men would not turn to care for each other’s sufferings, nor was there any to take up the corpse from
				where it lay.
				Beautiful bodies lay rotting in wealthy mansions.
				For where once the smallpox made its entry, the dwellers fled from the house and abandoned the sick man
				in their fear.</p>

<p class="PE">Mohendra Singha was a man of great wealth in the village of Padchinha, but today rich and poor
				were on one level.
				In this time of crowding afflictions his relatives, friends, servants, maidservants had all been seized
				by disease and gone from him.
				Some had died, some had fled.
				In that once peopled household there was only himself, his wife and one infant girl.
				This was the couple of whom I spoke.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1860">The wife, Kalyani, gave up thinking and went to the cowshed to milk the cow; then she warmed
				the milk, fed her child and went again to give the cow its grass and water.
				When she returned from her task Mohendra said, “How long can we go on in this way?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1861">“Not long;” answered Kalyani, “as long as we can.

<p class="P" search_id="T-1864"><em>Mohendra</em>.
				“Very possibly that place too is as empty of men and empty of means of subsistence as we are here.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1865"><em>Kalyani</em>.

<p class="P" search_id="T-1866">Mohendra answered, “This house has been full for many years of the gathered wealth of

<p class="P" search_id="T-1867"><em>Kalyani</em>.
				“If thieves come to loot it, shall we two be able to protect the treasure?

				If we survive, we can come back and enjoy what remains.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1868">“Will you be able to do the journey on foot?” asked Mohendra.
				“The palanquin-bearers are all dead.

				are no bullocks.”</p>

				“Oh, I shall be able to walk, do not fear.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1869">In her heart she thought, even if she fell and died on the way, these two at least would be
				saved.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1870">The next day at dawn the two took some money with them, locked up room and door, let loose the
				cattle, took the child in their arms and set out for the capital.
				At the time of starting Mohendra said, “The road is very difficult, at every step dacoits and highwaymen
				are hovering about, it is not well to go emptyhanded.”
				So saying Mohendra returned to the house and took from it musket, shot, and powder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1871">When she saw the weapon, Kalyani said, “Since you have remembered to take arms with you, hold
				Sukumari for a moment and I too will bring a weapon with me.”
				With the words she put her daughter into Mohendra’s arms and in her turn entered the house.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1872">Mohendra called after her, “Why, what weapon can you take with you?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1873">As she came, Kalyani hid a small casket of poison in her dress.
				Fearing what fate might befall her in these days of misfortune, she had already procured and kept the
				poison with her.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1874">It was the month of Jyaistha, a savage heat, the earth as if aflame, the wind scattering fire,
				the sky like a canopy of heated copper, the dust of the road like sparks of fire.
				Kalyani began to perspire profusely.
				Now resting under the shade of a babla-tree, now sitting in the shelter of a date-palm, drinking the
				muddy water of dried ponds, with great difficulty she journeyed forward.
				The girl was in Mohendra’s arms and sometimes he fanned her with his robe.
				Once the two refreshed themselves, seated under the boughs of a creeper-covered tree flowering with
				odorous blooms and dark-hued with dense shade-giving foliage.
				Mohendra wondered to see Kalyani’s endurance under fatigue.
				He drenched his robe with water from a neighbouring pool and sprinkled it on his and Kalyani’s face,
				forehead, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1875">Kalyani was a little cooled and refreshed, but both of them were distressed with great hunger.
				That could be borne, but the hunger and thirst of their child could not be endured, so they </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 477</p>
<p class="PE">resumed their march.
				Swimming through those waves of fire they arrived before evening at an inn.
				Mohendra had cherished a great hope that on reaching the inn he would be able to give cool water to his
				wife and child to drink and food to save their lives.
				But he met with a great disappointment.
				There was not a man in the inn.
				Big rooms were lying empty, the men had all fled.
				Mohendra after looking about the place made his wife and daughter lie down in one of the rooms.
				He began to call from outside in a loud voice, but got no answer.
				Then Mohendra said to Kalyani, “Will you have a little courage and stay here alone?
				If there is a cow to be found in this region, may Sri Krishna have pity on us and I shall bring you some
				milk.”
				He took an earthen waterjar in his hand and went out.
				A number of such jars were lying about the place.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 478</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h1>
<p class="PE">Mohendra departed.
				Left alone with no one near her but a little girl, Kalyani in that solitary and unpeopled place, in that
				almost pitch-dark cottage began to study closely every side.
				Great fear was upon her.
				No one anywhere, no sound of human existence to be heard, only the howling of the dogs and the jackals.
				She regretted letting her husband go,– hunger and thirst might after all have been borne a little
				longer.
				She thought of shutting all the doors and sitting in the security of the closed house.
				But not a single door had either panel or bolt.
				As she was thus gazing in every direction suddenly something in the doorway that faced her caught her
				eye, something like a shadow.
				It seemed to her to have the shape of a man and yet not to be human.
				Something utterly dried up and withered, something like a very black, a naked and terrifying human shape
				had come and was standing at the door.
				After a little while the shadow seemed to lift a hand,– with the long withered finger of a long withered
				hand, all skin and bone, it seemed to make a motion of summons to someone outside.
				Kalyani’s heart dried up in her with fear.
				Then just such another shadow, withered, black, tall, naked, came and stood by the side of the first.
				Then another came and yet another came.
				Many came,– slowly, noiselessly they began to enter the room.
				The room with its almost blind darkness grew dreadful as a midnight burning-ground.
				All those corpselike figures gathered round Kalyani and her daughter.
				Kalyani almost swooned away.
				Then the black withered men seized and lifted up the woman and the girl, carried them out of the house
				and entered into a jungle across the open fields.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1876">A few minutes afterwards Mohendra arrived with the milk in the waterjar.
				He found the whole place empty.
				Hither and </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 479</p>
<p class="PE">thither he searched, often called aloud his daughter’s name and at last even his wife’s.
				There was no answer, he could find no trace of his wife and child.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 480</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-iii">Chapter III</h1>
<p class="PE">It was a very beautiful woodland in which the robbers set down Kalyani.
				There was no light, no eye to see the loveliness,– the beauty of the wood remained invisible like the
				beauty of soul in a poor man’s heart.
				There might be no food in the country, but there was wealth of flowers in the woodland; so thick was the
				fragrance that even in that darkness one seemed to be conscious of a light.
				On a clear spot in the middle covered with soft grass the thieves set down Kalyani and her child and
				themselves sat around them.
				Then they began to debate what to do with them, for what ornaments Kalyani had with her were already in
				their possession.
				One group was very busy with the division of this booty.
				But when the ornaments had been divided, one of the robbers said, “What are we to do with gold and
				silver?
				Someone give me a handful of rice in exchange for an ornament; I am tortured with hunger, I have eaten
				today nothing but the leaves of trees.”
				No sooner had one so spoken than all echoed him and a clamour arose.
				“Give us rice, give us rice, we do not want gold and silver!”
				The leader tried to quiet them, but no one listened to him.
				Gradually high words began to be exchanged, abuse flowed freely, a fight became imminent.
				Everyone in a rage pelted the leader with his whole allotment of ornaments.
				He also struck one or two and this brought all of them upon him striking at him in a general assault.
				The robber captain was emaciated and ill with starvation, one or two blows laid him prostrate and
				lifeless.
				Then one in that hungry, wrathful, excited, maddened troop of plunderers cried out, “We have eaten the
				flesh of dogs and jackals and now we are racked with hunger; come, friends, let us feast today on this
				rascal.”
				Then all began to shout aloud “Glory to Kali!
				Bom Kali!! today we will eat human flesh.”
				And with this cry those black emaciated corpselike figures began to shout with laughter and dance and
				clap their hands in the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 481</p>
<p class="PE">congenial darkness.
				One of them set about lighting a fire to roast the body of the leader.
				He gathered dried creepers, wood and grass, struck flint and iron and set light to the collected fuel.
				As the fire burned up a little, the dark green foliage of the trees that were neighbours to the spot,
				mango, lemon, jackfruit and palm, tamarind and date, were lit up faintly with the flames.
				Here the leaves seemed ablaze, there the grass brightened in the light; in some places the darkness only
				became more crass and deep.
				When the fire was ready, one began to drag the corpse by the leg and was about to throw it on the fire,
				but another intervened and said “Drop it! stop, stop! if it is on the grand meat that we must keep
				ourselves alive today, then why the tough and juiceless flesh of this old fellow?
				We shall eat what we have looted and brought with us today.
				Come along, there is that tender girl, let us roast and eat her.”
				Another said “Roast anything you like, my good fellow, but roast it; I can stand this hunger no longer.”
				Then all gazed greedily towards the place where Kalyani and her daughter had lain.
				They saw the place empty; neither child nor mother was there.
				Kalyani had seen her opportunity when the robbers were disputing, taken her daughter into her arms, put
				the child’s mouth to her breast and fled into the wood.
				Aware of the escape of their prey, the ghostlike ruffian crew ran in every direction with a cry of
				“Kill, kill”.
				In certain conditions man is no better than a ferocious wild beast.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 482</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-iv">Chapter IV</h1>
<p class="PE">The darkness of the wood was very deep and Kalyani could not find her way.
				In the thickly-woven entanglement of trees, creepers and thorns there was no path at the best of times
				and on that there came this impenetrable darkness.
				Separating the branches and creepers, pushing through thorn and briar Kalyani began to make her way into
				the thickness of the wood.
				The thorns pierced the child’s skin and she cried from time to time; and at that the shouts of the
				pursuing robbers rose higher.
				In this way with torn and bleeding body, Kalyani made far progress into the woodland.
				After a little while the moon rose.
				Until then there was some slight confidence in Kalyani’s mind that in the darkness the robbers would not
				be able to find her and after a brief and fruitless search would desist from the pursuit, but, now that
				the moon had risen, that confidence left her.
				The moon, as it mounted into the sky, shed its light on the woodland tops and the darkness within was
				suffused with it.
				The darkness brightened, and here and there, through gaps, the outer luminousness found its way inside
				and peeped into the thickets.
				The higher the moon mounted, the more the light penetrated into the reaches of foliage, the deeper all
				the shadows took refuge in the thicker parts of the forest.
				Kalyani too with her child hid herself farther and farther in where the shadows retreated.
				And now the robbers shouted higher and began to come running from all sides, and the child in her terror
				wept louder.
				Kalyani then gave up the struggle and made no farther attempt to escape.
				She sat down with the girl on her lap on a grassy thornless spot at the foot of a great tree and called
				repeatedly “Where art Thou?
				Thou whom I worship daily, to whom daily I bow down, in reliance on whom I had the strength to penetrate
				into this forest, where art Thou, O Madhusudan?”
				At this time, what with fear, the deep emotion of spiritual love </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 483</p>
<p class="PE">and worship and the lassitude of hunger and thirst, Kalyani gradually lost sense of her
				outward surroundings and became full of an inward consciousness in which she was aware of a heavenly
				voice singing in mid-air,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1877">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1878">O Gopal, O Govinda, O Mukunda, O Shauri!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1879">O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1880">Kalyani had heard from her childhood, in the recitation of the Puranas, that the sages of
				Paradise roam the world on the paths of the sky, crying aloud to the music of the harp the name of Hari.
				That imagination took shape in her mind and she began to see with the inner vision a mighty ascetic,
				harp in hand, whitebodied, whitehaired, whitebearded, whiterobed, tall of stature, singing in the path
				of the azure heavens,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1881">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1882">Gradually the song grew nearer, louder she heard the words,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1883">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1884">Then still nearer, still clearer,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1885">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1886">At last over Kalyani’s head the chant rang echoing in the woodland,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1887">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1888">Then Kalyani opened her eyes.
				In the half-lustrous moonbeams suffused and shadowed with the darkness of the forest, she saw in front
				of her that whitebodied, whitehaired, whitebearded, whiterobed image of a sage.
				Dreamily all her consciousness centred on the vision.
				Kalyani thought to bow down to it, but she could not perform the salutation; even as she bent her head,
				all consciousness left her and she lay fallen supine on the ground.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 484</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-v">Chapter V</h1>
<p class="PE">In a huge tract of ground in the forest there was a great monastery engirt with ruined masses
				of stone.
				Archaeologists would tell us that this was formerly a monastic retreat of the Buddhists and afterwards
				became a Hindu monastery.
				Its rows of edifices were two-storeyed; in between were temples and in front a meeting-hall.
				Almost all these buildings were surrounded with a wall and so densely hidden with the trees of the
				forest that, even at daytime and at a short distance from the place, none could divine the presence of a
				human habitation here.
				The buildings were broken in many places, but by daylight one could see that the whole place had been
				recently repaired.
				A glance showed that man had made his dwelling in this profound and inaccessible wilderness.
				It was in a room in this monastery, where a great log was blazing, that Kalyani first returned to
				consciousness and beheld in front of her that whitebodied, whiterobed Great One.
				Kalyani began once more to gaze on him with eyes large with wonder, for even now memory did not return
				to her.
				Then the Mighty One of Kalyani’s vision spoke to her, “My child, this is a habitation of the Gods, here
				have no apprehension.
				I have a little milk, drink it and then I will talk with you.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1889">At first Kalyani could understand nothing, then, as by degrees her mind recovered some firm
				foundation, she threw the hem of her robe round her neck and made an obeisance at the Great One’s feet.
				He replied with a blessing and brought out from another room a sweet-smelling earthen pot in which he
				warmed some milk at the blazing fire.
				When the milk was warm he gave it to Kalyani and said, “My child, give some to your daughter to drink
				and then drink some yourself, afterwards you can talk.”
				Kalyani, with joy in her heart, began to administer the milk to her daughter.
				The unknown then said to her, “While I am absent, have no anxiety,” and left the temple.
				After a while </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 485</p>
<p class="PE">he returned from outside and saw that Kalyani had finished giving the milk to her child, but
				had herself drunk nothing; the milk was almost as it was at first, very little had been used.
				“My child,” said the unknown, “you have not drunk the milk; I am going out again, and until you drink I
				will not return.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1890">The sage-like personage was again leaving the room, when Kalyani once more made him an
				obeisance and stood before him with folded hands.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1891">“What is it you wish to say?” asked the recluse.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1892">Then Kalyani replied, “Do not command me to drink the milk, there is an obstacle.
				I will not drink it.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1893">The recluse answered in a voice full of compassion, “Tell me what is the obstacle; I am a
				forest-dwelling ascetic, you are my daughter; what can you have to say which you will not tell me?
				When I carried you unconscious from the forest, you then seemed to me as if you had been sadly
				distressed with thirst and hunger; if you do not eat and drink, how can you live?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1894">Kalyani answered, the tears dropping from her eyes, “You are a god and I will tell you.
				My husband remains still fasting and until I meet him again or hear of his tasting food, how can I eat?”
			</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1895">The ascetic asked, “Where is your husband?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1896">“I do not know,” said Kalyani, “the robbers stole me away after he had gone out in search of
				milk.”
				Then the ascetic by question after question elicited all the information about Kalyani and her husband.
				Kalyani did not indeed utter her husband’s name,– she could not; but the other information the ascetic
				received about him was sufficient for him to understand.
				He asked her, “Then you are Mohendra Singha’s wife?”
				Kalyani, in silence and with bowed head, began to heap wood on the fire at which the milk had been
				warmed.
				Then the ascetic said, “Do what I tell you, drink the milk; I am bringing you news of your husband.
				Unless you drink the milk, I will not go.”
				Kalyani asked, “Is there a little water anywhere here?”
				The ascetic pointed to a jar of water.
				Kalyani made a cup of her hands, the ascetic filled it with water; then Kalyani, approaching her hands
				with the water in them to the ascetic’s feet, said “Please put the dust of your feet </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 486</p>
<p class="PE">in the water.”
				When the ascetic had touched the water with his foot, Kalyani drank it and said, “I have drunk nectar of
				the gods, do not tell me to eat or drink anything else; until I have news of my husband I will take
				nothing else.”
				The ascetic answered, “Abide without fear in this temple.
				I am going in search of your husband.”</p>

				The ascetic climbed to the top of the hill and there in rigid silence listened, but for what he
				listened, it is not easy to say; for, in that great plain that seemed as vast as infinity, there was not
				a sound except the murmurous rustle of the trees.
				At one spot there is a great jungle near the foot of the hill,– the hill above, the high road below, the
				jungle between.
				I do not know what sound met his ear from the jungle, but it was in that direction the ascetic went.
				Entering into the denseness of the growth he saw in the forest, under the darkness of the branches at
				the foot of long rows of trees, men sitting,– men tall of stature, black of hue, armed; their burnished
				weapons glittered fierily in the moonlight where it fell through gaps in the woodland leafage.
				Two hundred such armed men were sitting there, not one uttering a single word.
				The ascetic went slowly into their midst and made some signal, but not a man rose, none spoke, none made
				a sound.
				He passed in front of all, looking at each as he went, scanning every face in the gloom, as if he were
				seeking someone he could not find.
				In his search he recognised one, touched him and made a sign, at which the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 488</p>
<p class="PE">other instantly rose.
				The ascetic took him to a distance and they stood and talked apart.
				The man was young; his handsome face wore a thick black moustache and beard; his frame was full of
				strength; his whole presence beautiful and attractive.
				He wore an ochre-coloured robe and on all his limbs the fairness and sweetness of sandal was smeared.
				The Brahmacharin said to him, “Bhavananda, have you any news of Mohendra Singha?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1898">Bhavananda answered, “Mohendra Singha and his wife and child left their house today; on the
				way, at the inn – ”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1899">At this point the ascetic interrupted him, “I know what happened at the inn.
				Who did it?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1900">“Village rustics, I imagine.
				Just now the peasants of all the villages have turned dacoits from compulsion of hunger.
				And who is not a dacoit nowadays?
				Today we also have looted and eaten.
				Two maunds of rice belonging to the Chief of Police were on its way; we took and consecrated it to a
				devotee’s dinner.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1901">The ascetic laughed and said, “I have rescued his wife and child from the thieves.
				I have just left them in the monastery.
				Now it is your charge to find out Mohendra and deliver his wife and daughter into his keeping.
				Jivananda’s presence here will be sufficient for the success of today’s business.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1902">Bhavananda undertook the mission and the ascetic departed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 489</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-vii">Chapter VII</h1>
<p class="PE">Mohendra rose from the floor of the inn where he was sitting, for nothing could be gained by
				sitting there and thinking over his loss.
				He started in the direction of the town with the idea of taking the help of the officials in the search
				for his wife and child.
				After journeying for some distance he saw in the road a number of bullock-carts surrounded by a great
				company of sepoys.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1903">In the Bengali year 1175 the province of Bengal had not become subject to British
				administration.
				The English were then the revenue officials of Bengal.
				They collected the taxes due to the treasury, but up to that time they had not taken upon themselves the
				burden of protecting the life and property of the Bengali people.
				The burden they had accepted was to take the country’s money; the responsibility of protecting life and
				property lay upon that despicable traitor and disgrace to humanity, Mirzafar.
				Mirzafar was incapable of protecting even himself; it was not likely that he would or could protect the
				people of Bengal.
				Mirzafar took opium and slept; the English raked in the rupees and wrote despatches; as for the people
				of Bengal they wept and went to destruction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1904">The taxes of the province were therefore the due of the English, but the burden of
				administration was on the Nawab.
				Wherever the English themselves collected the taxes due to them, they had appointed a collector, but the
				revenue collected went to Calcutta.
				People might die of starvation, but the collection of their monies did not stop for a moment.
				However, very much could not be collected: for if Mother Earth does not yield wealth, no one can create
				wealth out of nothing.
				Be that as it may, the little that could be collected, had been made into cartloads and was on its way
				to the Company’s treasury at Calcutta in charge of a military escort.
				At this time there was great danger from </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 490</p>
<p class="PE">dacoits, so fifty armed sepoys marched with fixed bayonets, ranked before and behind the
				carts.
				Their captain was an English soldier who went on horseback in the rear of the force.
				On account of the heat the sepoys did not march by day but only by night.
				As they marched, Mohendra’s progress was stopped by the treasure carts and this military array.
				Mohendra, seeing his way barred by sepoys and carts, stood at the side of the road; but as the sepoys
				still jostled him in passing, holding this to be no fit time for debate, he went and stood at the edge
				of the jungle by the road.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1905">Then a sepoy said in Hindustani, “See, there’s a dacoit making off.”
				The sight of the gun in Mohendra’s hand confirmed this belief.
				He went for Mohendra, caught hold of his neck and, with the salutation “Rogue! thief!” suddenly gave him
				a blow of the fist and wrested the gun from his hand.
				Mohendra, emptyhanded, merely returned the blow.
				Needless to say, Mohendra was something more than a little angry, and the worthy sepoy reeled with the
				blow and went down stunned on the road.
				Upon that, three or four sepoys came up, took hold of Mohendra and, dragging him forcibly to the
				commander, told the Saheb, “This man has killed one of the sepoys.”
				The Saheb was smoking and a little bewildered with strong drink; he replied, “Catch hold of the rogue
				and marry him.”
				The soldiers did not understand how they were to marry an armed highwayman, but in the hope that, with
				the passing of the intoxication, the Saheb would change his mind and the marriage would not be forced on
				them, three or four sepoys bound Mohendra hand and foot with the halters of the cart bullocks and lifted
				him into the cart.
				Mohendra saw that it would be vain to use force against so many, and, even if he could effect his escape
				by force, what was the use?
				Mohendra was depressed and sorrowful with grief for his wife and child and had no desire for life.
				The sepoys bound Mohendra securely to the wheel of the cart.
				Then with a slow and heavy stride the escort proceeded on its march.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 491</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-viii">Chapter VIII</h1>
<p class="PE">Possessed of the ascetic’s command, Bhavananda, softly crying the name of Hari, went in the
				direction of the inn where Mohendra had been sitting; for he thought it likely that there he would get a
				clue to Mohendra’s whereabouts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1906">At that time the present roads made by the English were not in existence.
				In order to come to Calcutta from the district towns, one had to travel by the marvellous roads laid
				down by the Mogul emperors.
				On his way from Padchinha to the town, Mohendra had been travelling from south to north, and it was
				therefore that he met the soldiers on the way.
				The direction Bhavananda had to take from the Hill of Palms towards the inn, was also from south to
				north; necessarily, he too on his way fell in with the sepoys in charge of the treasure.
				Like Mohendra, he stood aside to let them pass.
				Now, for one thing, the soldiers naturally believed that the dacoits would be sure to attempt the
				plunder of this despatch of treasure, and on that apprehension came the arrest of a dacoit in the very
				highway.
				When they saw Bhavananda too standing aside in the night-time, they inevitably concluded that here was
				another dacoit.
				Accordingly, they seized him on the spot.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1907">Bhavananda smiled softly and said, “Why so, my good fellow?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1908">“Rogue!” answered a sepoy, “you are a robber.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1909">“You can very well see I am an ascetic wearing the yellow robe.
				Is this the appearance of a robber?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1910">“There are plenty of rascally ascetics and Sannyasins who rob,” retorted the sepoy, and he
				began to push and drag Bhavananda.
				Bhavananda’s eyes flashed in the darkness, but he only said very humbly, “Good master, let me know your
				commands.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1911">The sepoy was pleased at Bhavananda’s politeness and said, “Here, rascal, take this load and
				carry it,” and he clapped a </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 492</p>
<p class="PE">bundle on Bhavananda’s head.
				Then another of the sepoys said to the first, “No, he will run away; tie up the rascal on the cart where
				the other rogue is bound.”
				Bhavananda grew curious to know who was the man they had bound; he threw away the bundle on his head and
				administered a slap on the cheek to the soldier who had put it there.
				In consequence, the sepoys bound Bhavananda, lifted him on to the cart and flung him down near Mohendra.
				Bhavananda at once recognised Mohendra Singha.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1912">The sepoys again marched on, carelessly and with noise, and the creaking of the cartwheels
				recommenced.
				Then, softly and in a voice audible only to Mohendra, Bhavananda said, “Mohendra Singha, I know you and
				am here to give you help.
				There is no need for you to know just at present who I am.
				Do very carefully what I tell you.
				Put the rope that ties your hands on the wheel of the cart.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1913">Mohendra, though astonished, carried out Bhavananda’s suggestion without a word.
				Moving a little towards the cartwheel under cover of darkness, he placed the rope that tied his hands so
				as to just touch the wheel.
				The rope was gradually cut through by the friction of the wheel.
				Then he cut the rope on his feet by the same means.
				As soon as he was free of his bonds, by Bhavananda’s advice he lay inert on the cart.
				Bhavananda also severed his bonds by the same device.
				Both lay utterly still and motionless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1914">The path of the soldiers took them precisely by the road where the Brahmacharin had stood in
				the highway near the jungle and gazed round him.
				As soon as they arrived near the hill, they saw under it, on the top of a mound, a man standing.
				Catching sight of his dark figure silhouetted against the moonlit azure sky, the havildar said, “There
				is another of the rogues; catch him and bring here: he shall carry a load.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1915">At that a soldier went to catch the man, but, though he saw the fellow coming to lay hold on
				him, the watcher stood firm; he did not stir.
				When the soldier laid hands on him, he said nothing.
				When he was brought as a prisoner to the havildar, even then he said nothing.
				The havildar ordered a load to be put on his head; a soldier put the load in place, he took it on his
			</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 493</p>
<p class="PE">head.
				Then the havildar turned away and started marching with the cart.
				At this moment a pistol shot rang suddenly out and the havildar, pierced through the head, fell on the
				road and breathed his last.
				A soldier shouted, “This rascal has shot the havildar,” and seized the luggage-bearer’s hand.
				The bearer had still the pistol in his grasp.
				He threw the load from him and struck the soldier on the head with the butt of his pistol; the man’s
				head broke and he dropped farther proceedings.
				Then with a cry of “Hari!
				Hari!
				Hari!” two hundred armed men surrounded the soldiery.
				The men were at that moment awaiting the arrival of their English captain, who, thinking the dacoits
				were on him, came swiftly up to the cart and gave the order to form a square; for an Englishman’s
				intoxication vanishes at the touch of danger.
				The sepoys immediately formed into a square facing four ways and at a farther command of their captain
				lifted their guns in act to fire.
				At this critical moment someone wrested suddenly the Englishman’s sword from his belt and with one blow
				severed his head from his body.
				With the rolling of the Englishman’s head from his shoulders the unspoken command to fire was silenced
				for ever.
				All looked and saw a man standing on the cart, sword in hand, shouting loud the cry of “Hari, Hari” and
				calling “Kill, kill the soldiers.”
				It was Bhavananda.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1916">The sudden sight of their captain headless and the failure of any officer to give the command
				for defensive action kept the soldiers for a few moments passive and appalled.
				The daring assailants took advantage of this opportunity to slay and wound many, reach the carts and
				take possession of the money chests.
				The soldiers lost courage, accepted defeat and took to flight.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1917">Then the man who had stood on the mound and afterwards assumed the chief leadership of the
				attack, came to Bhavananda.
				After a mutual embrace Bhavananda said, “Brother Jivananda, it was to good purpose that you took the vow
				of our brotherhood.”
				“Bhavananda,” replied Jivananda, “justified be your name.”
				Jivananda was charged with the office of arranging for the removal of the plundered treasure to its
				proper place and he swiftly departed with his following.
				Bhavananda alone remained standing on the field of action.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 494</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-ix">Chapter IX</h1>
<p class="PE">Mohendra had descended from the cart, wrested a weapon from one of the sepoys and made ready
				to join in the fight.
				But at this moment it came home clearly to him that these men were robbers and the plunder of the
				treasure the object of their attack on the soldiery.
				In obedience to this idea he stood away from the scene of the fight, for to help the robbers meant to be
				a partner in their ill-doing.
				Then he flung the sword away and was slowly leaving the place when Bhavananda came and stood near him.
				Mohendra said to him, “Tell me, who are you?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1918">Bhavananda replied, “What need have you to know that?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1919">“I have a need” said Mohendra.
				“You have done me today a very great service.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1920">“I hardly thought you realized it;” said Bhavananda, “you had a weapon in your hand and yet you
				stood apart.
				A landholder are you, and that’s a man good at being the death of milk and ghee, but when work has to be
				done, an ape.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1921">Before Bhavananda had well finished his tirade, Mohendra answered with contempt and disgust,
				“But this is bad work,– a robbery!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1922">“Robbery or not,” retorted Bhavananda, “we have done you some little service and are willing to
				do you a little more.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1923">“You have done me some service, I own,” said Mohendra, “but what new service can you do me?
				And at a dacoit’s hands I am better unhelped than helped.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1924">“Whether you accept our proffered service or not,” said Bhavananda, “depends on your own
				choice.
				If you do choose to take it, come with me.
				I will bring you where you can meet your wife and child.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1925">Mohendra turned and stood still.
				“What is that?” he cried.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 495</p>
<p class="PE">Bhavananda walked on without any reply, and Mohendra had no choice but to walk on with him,
				wondering in his heart what new kind of robbers were these.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 496</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-x">Chapter X</h1>
<p class="PE">Silently in the moonlit night the two crossed the open country.
				Mohendra was silent, sorrowful, full of pride, but also a little curious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1926">Suddenly Bhavananda’s whole aspect changed.
				No longer was he the ascetic, serious of aspect, calm of mood; no longer the skilful fighter, the heroic
				figure of the man who had beheaded the English captain with the sweep of a sword; no longer had he that
				aspect with which even now he had proudly rebuked Mohendra.
				It was as if the sight of that beauty of plain and forest, river and numerous streams, all the moonlit
				peaceful earth, had stirred his heart with a great gladness; it was as if Ocean were laughing in the
				moonbeams.
				Bhavananda became smiling, eloquent, courteous of speech.
				He grew very eager to talk and made many efforts to open a conversation, but Mohendra would not speak.
				Then Bhavananda, having no other resource, began to sing to himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1927">“Mother, I bow to thee!<br/>
				Rich with thy hurrying streams,<br/>
				Bright with thy orchard gleams,<br/>
				Cool with thy winds of delight,<br/>
				Dark fields waving, Mother of might,<br/>
				Mother free!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1928">The song astonished Mohendra and he could understand nothing of it.
				Who might be this richly watered, richly fruited Mother, cool with delightful winds and dark with the
				harvests?
				“What Mother?” he asked.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1929">Bhavananda without any answer continued his song.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1930">“Glory of moonlight dreams<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="T-1931">Mohendra said, “That is the country, it is not the Mother.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1932">Bhavananda replied, “We recognize no other Mother.

<p class="P" search_id="T-1933">Then Mohendra understood and said, “Sing it again.”

<p class="PE">no necessity for two hundred men to run from one cannon ball.
				But one cannon ball will send a Mussulman with his whole clan running, while a whole clan of cannon

<p class="P" search_id="T-1975">“Have you all these virtues?” asked Mohendra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1976">“No,” said Bhavananda, “but virtues don’t fall from the nearest tree.
				You have to practise them.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1977">“Do you practise them?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1978">“Do you not see we are sannyasins?
				It is for this practice that we have made renunciation.
				When our work is done, when our training is complete, we shall again become householders.
				We also have wives and daughters.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1979">“You have abandoned all those ties, but have you been able to overcome Maya?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1980">“The Children are not allowed to speak falsely and I will not make a lying boast to you.
				Who has the strength to conquer Maya?
				When a man says, ‘I have conquered Maya’, either he never had any feeling or he is making a vain boast.
				We have not conquered Maya, we are only keeping our vow.
				Will you be one of the Children?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1981">“Until I get news of my wife and daughter, I cannot say anything.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1982">“Come then, you shall see your wife and child.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1983">The two went on their way; and Bhavananda began again to sing Bande Mataram.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1984">Mohendra had a good voice and was a little proficient in singing and fond of it; therefore he
				joined in the song, and found that as he sang the tears came into his eyes.
				Then Mohendra said, “If I have not to abandon my wife and daughter, then initiate me into this vow.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1985">“Whoever” answered Bhavananda, “takes this vow, must abandon wife and child.
				If you take this vow, you cannot be allowed to meet your wife and daughter.

				look upon their faces is forbidden.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1986">“I will not take your vow,” answered Mohendra.</p>

<p class="PE">The day had dawned.
				That unpeopled forest, so long dark and silent, now grew full of light, blissful with the cooing and
				calling of the birds.
				In that delightful dawn, that joyous forest, that “Monastery of Bliss” Satyananda, seated on a deerskin,
				was performing his morning devotions.
				Jivananda sat near.
				It was at such a time that Bhavananda appeared with Mohendra Singha behind.
				The ascetic without a word continued his devotions and no one ventured to utter a sound.
				When the devotions were finished, Bhavananda and Jivananda saluted him and with humility seated
				themselves after taking the dust of his feet.
				Then Satyananda beckoned to Bhavananda and took him outside.
				What conversation took place between them, we do not know, but on the return of the two into the temple
				the ascetic, with compassion and laughter in his countenance, said to Mohendra, “My son, I have been
				greatly distressed by your misfortune; it was only by the grace of the Friend of the poor and miserable
				that I was able to rescue your wife and daughter last night.”
				The ascetic then told Mohendra the story of Kalyani’s rescue and said at the end, “Come, let me take you
				where they are.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1987">The ascetic in front, Mohendra behind entered into the inner precincts of the temple.
				Mohendra beheld a wide and lofty hall.
				Even in this cheerful dawn, glad with the youth of the morning, when the neighbouring groves glittered
				in the sunshine as if set and studded with diamonds, in this great room there was almost a gloom as of
				night.
				Mohendra could not at first see what was in the room, but by gazing and gazing and still gazing he was
				able to distinguish a huge image of the four-armed Vishnu, bearing the shell, the discus, the club, the
				lotus-blossom, adorned with the jewel Coustoobh on his breast; in front the discus called Sudarshan, the
				Beautiful, seemed visibly to be whirling round.
			</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 503</p>
<p class="PE">Two huge headless images representing Madhu and Kaitabh were painted before the figure, as if
				bathed in their own blood.
				On the left stood Lakshmi with flowing locks garlanded with wreaths of hundred-petalled lotuses, as if
				distressed with fear.
				On the right stood Saraswati surrounded by books, musical instruments, the incarnate strains and
				symphonies of music.
				On Vishnu’s lap sat an image of enchanting beauty, lovelier than Lakshmi and Saraswati, more splendid
				with opulence and lordship.
				The Gandharva and Kinnara and God and elf and giant paid her homage.
				The ascetic asked Mohendra in a voice of deep solemnity and awe, “Can you see all?”
				“Yes” replied Mohendra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1988">“Have you seen what is in the lap of Vishnu?” asked the ascetic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1989">“Yes,” answered Mohendra, “who is she?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1990">“It is the Mother.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1991">“What mother?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1992">“She whose children we are,” replied the ascetic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1993">“Who is she?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1994">“In time you will recognise her.
				Cry ‘Hail to the Mother!’</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1995">Now come, you shall see.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1996">The ascetic took Mohendra into another room.
				There he saw an image of Jagaddhatri, Protectress of the world, wonderful, perfect, rich with every
				ornament.
				“Who is she?” asked Mohendra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1997">The Brahmacharin replied, “The Mother as she was.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1998">“What is that?” asked Mohendra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-1999">“She trampled underfoot the elephants of the forest and all wild beasts and in the haunt of the
				wild beasts she erected her lotus throne.
				She was covered with every ornament, full of laughter and beauty.
				She was in hue like the young sun, splendid with all opulence and empire.
				Bow down to the Mother.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2000">Mohendra saluted reverently the image of the Motherland as the protectress of the world.
				The Brahmacharin then showed him a dark underground passage and said, “Come by this way.”
				Mohendra with some alarm followed him.
				In a dark room in the bowels of the earth an insufficient light entered from some unperceived outlet.
				By that faint light he saw an image of Kali.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 504</p>
<p class="PE">The Brahmacharin said, “Look on the Mother as she now is.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2001">Mohendra said in fear, “It is Kali.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2002">“Yes, Kali enveloped in darkness, full of blackness and gloom.
				She is stripped of all, therefore naked.
				Today the whole country is a burial ground, therefore is the Mother garlanded with skulls.
				Her own God she tramples under her feet.
				Alas, my Mother!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2003">The tears began to stream from the ascetic’s eyes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2004">“Why,” asked Mohendra, “has she in her hands the club and the skull?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2005">“We are the Children, we have only just given weapons into our Mother’s hands.
				Cry ‘Hail to the Mother!’”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2006">Mohendra said “Bande Mataram” and bowed down to Kali.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2007">The ascetic said “Come by this way”, and began to ascend another underground passage.
				Suddenly the rays of the morning sun shone in their eyes and from every side the sweet-voiced family of
				birds shrilled in song.
				In a wide temple built in stone of marble they saw a beautifully fashioned image of the Ten-armed
				Goddess made in gold, laughing and radiant in the light of the early sun.
				The ascetic saluted the image and said, “This is the Mother as she shall be.
				Her ten arms are extended towards the ten regions and they bear many a force imaged in her manifold
				weapons; her enemies are trampled under her feet and the lion on which her foot rests, is busy
				destroying the foe.
				Behold her, with the regions for her arms,” – as he spoke, Satyananda began to sob,– “with the regions
				for her arms, wielder of manifold weapons, trampler down of her foes, with the lion-heart for the steed
				of her riding; on her right Lakshmi as Prosperity, on her left Speech, giver of learning and science,
				Kartikeya with her as Strength, Ganesh as Success.
				Come, let us both bow down to the Mother.”
				Both with lifted faces and folded hands began to cry with one voice, “O auspicious with all well-omened
				things, O thou ever propitious, who effectest all desire, O refuge of men, three-eyed and fair of hue, O
				Energy of Narayan, salutation to thee.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2008">The two men bowed down with awe and love, and when </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 505</p>
<p class="PE">they rose, Mohendra asked in a broken voice, “When shall I see this image of the Mother?”
				“When all the Mother’s sons” replied the Brahmacharin, “learn to call the Mother by that name, on that
				day the Mother will be gracious to us.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2009">Suddenly Mohendra asked, “Where are my wife and daughter?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2010">“Come” said the ascetic, “you shall see them.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2011">“I wish to see them once and say farewell.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2012">“Why should you say farewell?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2013">“I shall take up this mighty vow.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2014">“Where will you send them to?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2015">Mohendra thought for a little and then said, “There is no one in my house and I have no other
				place.
				Yet in this time of famine, what other place can I find?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2016">“Go out of the temple,” said the ascetic, “by the way by which you came here.
				At the door of the temple you will see your wife and child.
				Up to this moment Kalyani has eaten nothing.
				You will find articles of food in the place where they are sitting.
				When you have made her eat, do whatever you please; at present you will not again meet any of us.
				If this mind of yours holds, at the proper time I shall show myself to you.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2017">Then suddenly by some path unknown the ascetic vanished from the place.
				Mohendra went forth by the way pointed out to him and saw Kalyani with her daughter sitting in the court
				of meeting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2018">Satyananda on his side descended by another underground passage into a secret cellar under the
				earth.
				There Jivananda and Bhavananda sat counting rupees and arranging them in piles.
				In that room gold, silver, copper, diamonds, coral, pearls were arrayed in heaps.
				It was the money looted on the previous night they were arranging.
				Satyananda, as he entered the room, said, “Jivananda, Mohendra will come to us.
				If he comes, it will be a great advantage to the Children, for in that case the wealth accumulated in
				his family from generation to generation will be devoted to the Mother’s service.
				But so long as he is not body and soul devoted to the Mother, do not take him into the order.
				As soon as the work you have in hand is completed, follow him </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 506</p>
<p class="PE">at various times and when you see it is the proper season, bring him to the temple of Vishnu.
				And in season or out of season protect their lives.
				For even as the punishment of the wicked is the duty of the Children, so is the protection of the good
				equally their duty.”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 507</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-xii">Chapter XII</h1>
<p class="PE">It was after much tribulation that Mohendra and Kalyani met again.
				Kalyani flung herself down and wept, Mohendra wept even more than she.
				The weeping over, there was much ado of wiping the eyes, for as often as the eyes were wiped, the tears
				began to come again.
				But when at last the tears had ceased to come, the thought of food occurred to Kalyani.
				She asked Mohendra to partake of the food which the ascetic’s followers had kept with her.
				In this time of famine there was no chance of ordinary food and vegetables, but whatever there was in
				the country, was to be had in plenty among the Children.
				That forest was inaccessible to ordinary men.
				Wherever there was a tree with fruit upon it, famishing men stripped it of what it bore, but none other
				than the Children had access to the fruit of the trees in this impenetrable wilderness.
				For this reason the ascetic’s followers had been able to bring for Kalyani plenty of forest fruits and
				some milk.
				In the property of the Sannyasin were included a number of cows.
				At Kalyani’s request, Mohendra first took some food, afterwards Kalyani sat apart and ate something of
				what he had left.
				She gave some of the milk to her child and kept the rest to feed her with again.
				Then both of them, overcome with sleep, took rest for a while.
				When they woke, they began to discuss where they should go next.
				“We left home” said Kalyani “in fear of danger and misfortune, but I now see there are greater dangers
				and misfortunes abroad than at home.
				Come then, let us return to our own house.”
				That also was Mohendra’s intention.
				It was his wish to keep Kalyani at home under the care of some suitable guardian and take upon himself
				this beautiful, pure and divine vow of service to the Mother.
				Therefore he gave his consent very readily.
				The husband and wife, rested from fatigue, took their daughter in their arms and set forth in the
				direction of Padchinha.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 508</p>
<p class="PE">But what way led to Padchinha, they could not at all make out in that thick and difficult
				forest.
				They had thought that once they could find the way out of the wood, they would be able to find the road.
				But now they could not find the way out of the wood itself.
				After long wandering in the thickets, their circlings began to bring them round to the monastery once
				more, no way of exit could be found.
				In front of them they saw an unknown ascetic in the dress of a Vaishnav Gosain, who stood in the path
				and laughed at them.
				Mohendra, in some irritation, said to him, “What are you laughing at, Gosain?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2019">“How did you enter the forest?” asked the Gosain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2020">“Well, we have entered it, it does not matter how.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2021">“Then, when you have entered, how is it you cannot get out again?”
				So saying, the ascetic resumed his laughter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2022">“Since you laugh,” said Mohendra, much provoked, “I presume you can yourself get out?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2023">“Follow me,” said the Vaishnav, “I will show you the way.
				You must undoubtedly have entered the forest in the company of some one of the ascetics.
				No one else knows the way either into or out of the forest.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2024">On this Mohendra asked, “Are you one of the Children?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2025">“I am” answered the Vaishnav.
				“Come with me.
				It is to show you the way that I am standing here.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2026">“What is your name?” asked Mohendra.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2027">“My name” replied the Vaishnav “is Dhirananda Goswami.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2028">Dhirananda proceeded in front, Mohendra and Kalyani followed.
				Dhirananda took them out of the forest by a very difficult path and again plunged back among the trees.
			</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2029">On leaving the forest one came after a little to a common with trees.
				To one side of it there was the highway running along the forest, and in one place a little river flowed
				out of the woodland with a murmuring sound.
				Its water was very clear, but dark like a thick cloud.
				On either bank beautiful dark-green trees of many kinds threw their shadow over the river and in their
				branches birds of different families sat and gave forth their various notes.
				Those notes too were sweet and mingled with the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 509</p>
<p class="PE">sweet cadence of the stream.
				With a similar harmony the shadow of the trees agreed and mingled with the colour of the stream.
				Kalyani sat under a tree on the bank and bade her husband sit near.
				Mohendra sat down, and she took her child from her husband’s lap into her own.
				Kalyani held her husband’s hand in hers and for some time sat in silence, then she asked, “Today I see
				that you are very melancholy.
				The calamity that was on us, we have escaped; why then are you so sad?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2030">Mohendra answered with a deep sigh, “I am no longer my own man, and what I am to do, I cannot
				understand.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2031">“Why?” asked Kalyani.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2032">“Hear what happened to me after I lost you,” said Mohendra, and he gave a detailed account of
				all that had happened to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2033">Kalyani said, “I too have suffered greatly and gone through many misadventures.
				It will be of no advantage to you to hear it.
				I cannot say how I managed to sleep in such exceeding misadventure, but today in the early hours of the
				morning I fell asleep, and in my sleep I saw a dream.
				I saw – I cannot say by what force of previous good works I went there,– but I saw myself in a region of
				wonder, where there was no solid Earth, but only light, a very soft sweet light as if of a cool lustre
				broken by clouds.
				There was no human being there, only luminous forms, no noise, only a sound as if of sweet song and
				music at a great distance.
				Myriads of flowers seemed to be ever newly in bloom, for the scent of them was there, jasmines of many
				kinds and other sweet-smelling blossoms.
				There in a place high over all, the cynosure of all, one seemed to be sitting, like a dark blue hill
				that has grown bright as fire and burns softly from within.
				A great fiery crown was on his head, his arms seemed to be four.
				Those who sat at either side of him, I could not recognize, but I think they were women in their forms,
				but so full of beauty, light and fragrance that every time I gazed in that direction, my senses were
				perplexed, I could not fix my gaze nor see who they were.
				In front of the Four-Armed another woman’s form seemed to be standing.
				She too was luminous, but surrounded by clouds so that the light could not well manifest itself; it
				could </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 510</p>
<p class="PE">only be dimly realised that one in the form of a woman wept, one full of heart’s distress, one
				worn and thin, but beautiful exceedingly.
				It seemed to me that a soft fragrant wind carried me along, pushing me as with waves, till it brought me
				to the foot of the Four-Armed’s throne.
				It seemed to me that the worn and cloud-besieged woman pointed to me and said, ‘This is she, for whose
				sake Mohendra will not come to my bosom.’
				Then there was a sound like the sweet clear music of a flute; it seemed that the Four-Armed said to me,
				‘Leave your husband and come to Me.
				This is your Mother, your husband will serve her; but if you stay at your husband’s side, that service
				cannot be given.
				Come away to Me.’
				I wept and said, ‘How shall I come, leaving my husband?’
				Then the flutelike voice came again, ‘I am husband, father, mother, son, daughter; come to Me.’
				I do not remember what I said.
				Then I woke.”
				Kalyani spoke and was again silent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2034">Mohendra also, astonished, amazed, alarmed, kept silence.
				Overhead the doyel began its clamour, the papia flooded heaven with its voice, the call of the cuckoo
				set the regions echoing, the bhringaraj made the grove quiver with its sweet cry.
				At their feet the stream murmured softly between its banks.
				The wind carried to them the soft fragrance of the woodland flowers.
				In places bits of sunlight glittered on the waves of the rivulet.
				Somewhere palm-leaves rustled in the slow wind.
				Far off a blue range of mountains met the eye.
				For a long time they remained silent in delight.
				Then Kalyani again asked, “What are you thinking?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2035">“I am thinking what I should do.
				The dream is nothing but a thought of fear, it is born of itself in the mind and of itself it
				disappears,– a bubble from the waking life.
				Come, let us go home.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2036">“Go where God bids you,” said Kalyani and put her child in her husband’s lap.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2037">Mohendra took his daughter in his lap and said, “And you,– where will you go?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2038">Kalyani, covering her eyes with her hands and pressing her forehead between them, answered, “I
				too will go where God has bid me.”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 511</p>
<p class="PE">Mohendra started and said, “Where is that?
				How will you go?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2039">Kalyani showed him the small box of poison.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2040">Mohendra said in astonishment, “What, you will take poison?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2041">“I meant to take it, but – ” Kalyani became silent and began to think.
				Mohendra kept his gaze on her face and every moment seemed to him a year, but when he saw that she did
				not complete her unfinished words, he asked, “But what?
				What were you going to say?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2042">“I meant to take it, but leaving you behind, leaving Sukumari behind, I have no wish to go to
				Paradise itself.
				I will not die.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2043">With the words Kalyani set down the box on the earth.
				Then the two began to talk of the past and future and became absorbed in their talk.
				Taking advantage of their absorption the child in her play took up the box of poison.
				Neither of them observed it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2044">Sukumari thought, “This is a very fine toy.”
				She held it in her left hand and slapped it well with her right, put it in her right, and slapped it
				with her left.
				Then she began pulling at it with both hands.
				As a result the box opened and the pill fell out.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2045">Sukumari saw the little pill fall on her father’s cloth and took it for another toy.
				She threw the box away and pounced on the pill.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2046">How it was that Sukumari had not put the box into her mouth, it is hard to say, but she made no
				delay in respect of the pill.
				“Eat it as soon as you get it;” – Sukumari crammed the pill into her mouth.
				At that moment her mother’s attention was attracted to her.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2047">“What has she eaten?
				What has she eaten?” cried Kalyani, and she thrust her finger into the child’s mouth.
				Then both saw that the box of poison was lying empty.
				Then Sukumari, thinking that here was another game, clenched her teeth,– only a few had just come out,–
				and smiled in her mother’s face.
				By this time the taste of the poison-pill must have begun to feel bitter in </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 512</p>
<p class="PE">the mouth, for a little after she loosened the clench of her teeth of herself and Kalyani took
				out the pill and threw it away.
				The child began to cry.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2048">The pill fell on the ground.
				Kalyani dipped the loose end of her robe in the stream and poured the water into her daughter’s mouth.
				In a tone of pitiful anxiety she asked Mohendra, “Has a little of it gone down her throat?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2049">It is the worst that comes first to a parent’s mind,– the greater the love, the greater the
				fear.
				Mohendra had not seen how large the pill was before, but now, after taking the pill into his hand and
				scrutinising it for some time, he said, “I think she has sucked in a good deal of it.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2050">Necessarily, Kalyani adopted Mohendra’s belief.
				For a long time she too held the pill in her hand and examined it.
				Meanwhile the child, owing to the little she had swallowed, became a little indisposed; she grew
				restless, cried, at last grew a little dull and feeble.
				Then Kalyani said to her husband, “What more?
				Sukumari has gone the way God called me to go.
				I too must follow her.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2051">And with the words Kalyani put the pill into her mouth and in a moment had swallowed it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2052">Mohendra cried out, “What have you done, Kalyani, what have you done?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2053">Kalyani returned no answer, but taking the dust of her husband’s feet on her head, only said,
				“Lord and Master, words will only multiply words.
				I take farewell.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2054">But Mohendra cried out again, “Kalyani, what have you done?” and began to weep aloud.
				Then Kalyani said in a very soft voice, “I have done well.
				You might otherwise neglect the work given you by Heaven for the sake of so worthless a thing as a
				woman.
				See, I was transgressing a divine command, therefore my child has been taken from me.
				If I disregarded it farther, you too might go.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2055">Mohendra replied with tears, “I could have kept you somewhere and come back,– when our work had
				been accomplished, I could have again been happy with you.
				Kalyani, my all!
				Why have you done this thing?
				You have cut from me the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 513</p>
<p class="PE">hand by whose strength I could have held the sword.
				What am I without you?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2056">“Where could you have taken me?
				Where is there any place?
				Mother, father, friends, all in this terrible time of calamity have perished.
				In whose house is there any place for us, where is the road we can travel, where will you take me?
				I am a burden hanging on your neck.
				I have done well to die.
				Give me this blessing that when I have gone to that luminous world, I may again see you.”
				With the words Kalyani again took the dust of her husband’s feet and placed it on her head.
				Mohendra made no reply, but once more began to weep.
				Kalyani again spoke; – her voice was very soft, very sweet, very tender, as she again said, “Consider
				who has the strength to transgress what God has willed.
				He has laid his command on me to go; could I stay, if I would?
				If I had not died of my own will, inevitably someone else would have slain me.
				I do well to die.
				Perform with your whole strength the vow you have undertaken, it will create a force of well-doing by
				which I shall attain heaven and both of us together will enjoy celestial bliss to all eternity.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2057">Meanwhile the little girl threw up the milk she had drunk and recovered,– the small amount of
				poison that she had swallowed, was not fatal.
				But at that time Mohendra’s mind was not turned in that direction.
				He put his daughter in Kalyani’s lap and closely embracing both of them began to weep incessantly.
				Then it seemed that in the midst of the forest a soft yet thunder-deep sound arose,–</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2058">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2059">O Gopal, O Govinda, O Mukunda, O Shauri!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2060">By that time the poison had begun to act on Kalyani, her consciousness was being somewhat taken
				from her; in her halfunconscious condition she seemed to herself to hear the words ringing out in the
				marvellous flutelike voice she had heard in the Vaikuntha of her dream.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2061">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2062">O Gopal, O Govinda, O Mukunda, O Shauri!”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 514</p>
<p class="PE">Then Kalyani in her semi-unconsciousness began to sing in a voice sweeter than any Apsara’s,
			</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2063">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2064">She cried to Mohendra, “Say,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2065">‘O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!’”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2066">Deeply moved by the sweet voice that rose from the forest and the sweet voice of Kalyani and in
				the grief of his heart thinking “God is my only helper,” Mohendra called aloud,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2067">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2068">Then from all sides the sound arose,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2069">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2070">Then it seemed as if the very birds in the trees were singing,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2071">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2072">It seemed as if the murmurs of the river repeated,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2073">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2074">Then Mohendra, forgetting his grief and affliction and full of ecstasy, sang in one voice with
				Kalyani,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2075">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2076">From the forest the cry seemed to rise in chorus with their song,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2077">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2078">Kalyani’s voice became fainter and fainter, but still she cried,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2079">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2080">Then by degrees her voice grew hushed, no sound came from her lips, her eyes closed, her body
				grew cold, and Mohendra understood that Kalyani had departed to Vaikuntha with the cry of “O Hari, O
				Murari” on her lips.
				Then Mohendra began to call out loudly like one frantic, making the forest quiver, </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 515</p>
<p class="PE">startling the birds and beasts,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2081">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2082">At that time one came and, embracing him closely, began to call with him in a voice as loud as
				his,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2083">“O Hari, O Murari, O foe of Kaitabh and Madhu!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2084">Then in that glory of the Infinite, in that boundless forest, before the body of her who now
				travelled the eternal way, the two sang the name of Eternal God.
				The birds and beasts were voiceless, the earth full of a miraculous beauty,– the fitting temple for this
				highest anthem.
				Satyananda sat down with Mohendra in his arms.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 516</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-xiii">Chapter XIII</h1>
<p class="PE">Meanwhile there was a great commotion in the high road in the capital.
				The noise went abroad that Sannyasins had plundered the revenue that was being despatched from the royal
				treasury to Calcutta.
				Then by order of the Government sepoys and spearmen sped on all sides to seize Sannyasins.
				Now at that time in that famine-stricken country there was no great number of real Sannyasins; for these
				ascetics live upon alms, and when people themselves get nothing to eat, there is not likely to be anyone
				to give alms to the mendicant.
				Therefore all the genuine ascetics had fled from the pinch of hunger to the country about Benares and
				Prayag.
				Only the Children wore the robe of the Sannyasin when they willed, abandoned it when abandonment was
				needed.
				Now too, many, seeing trouble abroad, left the dress of the ascetic.
				For this reason the hungry retainers of power, unable to find a Sannyasin anywhere, could only break the
				waterjars and cooking-pots of the householders and return with their empty bellies only half-filled.
				Satyananda alone would at no time leave his saffron robe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2085">At the moment when on the bank of that dark and murmurous rivulet, on the borders of the high
				road, at the foot of the tree on the water’s verge, Kalyani lay still and Mohendra and Satyananda in
				each other’s embrace were calling on God with streaming eyes, Jamadar Nazir-ud-din and his sepoys
				arrived at the spot.
				Forthwith he put his hand on Satyananda’s throat and said, “Here is a rascal of a Sannyasin.”
				Immediately another seized Mohendra; for a man who consorts with Sannyasins, must necessarily be a
				Sannyasin.
				A third hero was about to arrest the dead body of Kalyani where it lay at length on the grass.
				Then he saw that it was the corpse of a woman and very possibly might not be a Sannyasin, and did not
				proceed with the arrest.
				On the same reasoning they left the little girl alone.
				Then without </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 517</p>
<p class="PE">colloquy of any kind they bound the two prisoners and marched them off.
				The corpse of Kalyani and her little daughter remained lying unprotected at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2086">Mohendra was at first almost senseless with the oppression of grief and the frenzy of divine
				love; he could not understand what was toward or what had happened and made no objection to being bound;
				but when they had gone a few paces, he awoke to the fact that they were being led away in bonds.
				Immediately it occurred to him that Kalyani’s corpse was left lying without funeral rites, that his
				little daughter was left lying, and that even now wild beasts might devour them, he wrenched his hands
				apart by sheer force and with the one wrench tore his bonds apart.
				With one kick he sent the Jamadar sprawling to the ground and fell upon one of the sepoys; but the other
				three seized him from three sides and once more overpowered and rendered him helpless.
				Then Mohendra in the wretchedness of his grief said to the Brahmacharin Satyananda, “If only you had
				helped me a little, I would have slain these five miscreants.”
				“What strength is there” answered Satyananda, “in this aged body of mine,– except Him on whom I was
				calling, I have no other strength.
				Do not struggle against the inevitable.
				We shall not be able to overpower these five men.
				Come, let us see where they will take us.
				The Lord will be our protection in all things.”
				Then both of them without farther attempt at escape followed the soldiers.
				When they had gone a little distance, Satyananda asked the sepoys, “My good fellows, I am in the habit
				of calling on the name of Hari; is there any objection to my calling on His name?”
				The Jamadar thought Satyananda to be a simple and inoffensive man, and he said, “Call away, I won’t stop
				you.
				You are an old Brahmacharin and I think there will be an order for your discharge; this ruffian will be
				hanged.”
				Then the Brahmacharin began softly to sing,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2087">With the lingering wind in her tresses,<br/>
				Where the stream its banks caresses,<br/>
				There is one in the woodland, a woman and fair.<br/>
				Arise, O thou hero, let speed</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 518</p>
<p class="PE">Be swift in thy feet to her need;<br/>
				For the child who is there<br/>
				Is full of sorrow and weeping and care.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2088">On arriving in the city they were taken to the Chief of Police, who sent word to the Government
				and put the Brahmacharin and Mohendra for the time into confinement.
				That was a dreadful prison, for it was seldom that he who entered came out, because there was no one to
				judge.
				It was not the British jail with which we are familiar – at that time there was not the British system
				of justice.
				Those were the days of no procedure, these are the days of procedure.
				Compare the two!</p>

<h2 class="Cp-Hd">Chapter I</h2>
<p class="PE">It was the summer of the Bengali year 1176.
				The village of Podchinha lay oppressed under a tyrannous heat of the midsummer sun.
				The village was packed with houses, but people were nowhere to be seen.
				Rows of shops in the bazaar, rows of booths in the market place, hundreds of clay houses in every
				quarter with here and there high and low terraced mansions; but today all was silent.
				In the bazaar the shops were shut; the shopkeepers had fled, one knows not where.
				It was market-day, but the market was not in swing,– begging-day, but the beggars were not out.
				The weaver had stopped his loom and lay weeping to one side of his cottage; the trader had ceased to ply
				his trade and sat weeping with his infant child in his lap; the giver had ceased to give; the teacher
				had shut up his school; even the little children had no force or courage left to cry.
				No passers-by were to be seen in the highway, no bathers in the lake, no human figures at the
				house-doors; there was not a bird in the trees, not a cow in the pasture; only in the burning-ground the
				dog and the jackal were abroad.
				One huge building whose great fluted pillars could be seen from far off bore a brave appearance as of a
				mountain peak arising out of this wilderness of houses.
				But today its splendour was a void thing, its doors shut, its rooms empty of human concourse, all its
				voices hushed, entry difficult even to the breezes.
				In a room within this building there was darkness at midday and in the darkness like twin flowers
				blooming in the night a young couple, husband and wife, were sitting plunged in thought.
				And in front of them sat the spectre of Famine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2089">The harvest of 1174 had not been good; so in 1175 rice was dear and the people suffered, but
				the Government exacted the taxes to the last fraction of a farthing.
				The poor paid and </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 520</p>
<p class="PE">ate only once a day.
				But in 1175 there was good rain and the people thought that Heaven had taken pity on them.
				The herdsman began again to sing in his gladness in the meadow, and the peasant’s wife to tease her
				husband for a silver armlet.
				But suddenly in the month of Aswin Heaven turned away its face.
				Not a drop of rain fell through all Aswin and Kartik.
				In the fields the stalks dried up and became mere straw and wherever a field or two had borne its crop
				the officials bought it up for the troops.
				The people had nothing to eat.
				At first they fasted at one of their two meal-times, then they began to eat one halfmeal a day, then to
				fast both morning and evening.
				Whatever little crop there was in the month of Chaitra never reached their mouths.
				But Mahomed Reza Khan, who controlled the collection of the Revenues and thought that he could now show
				himself a very Sarafraz, increased at one leap the taxes by ten percent.
				Throughout Bengal a great noise of weeping arose.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2090">People first took to begging, but soon there was no one to give alms.
				They began to fast; disease attacked them.
				They sold their cows, they sold plough and tool, they sold their seed, sold their houses, sold their
				plots of land.
				Then they began to sell their girls, then their boys, then their wives.
				In the end there was no one to buy wife, boy or girl.
				All were sellers; buyer there was none.
				For want of other food, men began to eat the leaves of trees, to eat grass, to eat weeds.
				The low classes and the wild people devoured dogs, rats and cats.
				Many fled the country.
				Those who fled perished of starvation in other lands; those who remained living upon uneatable things or
				not eating at all, began to fall ill and die of various maladies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2091">Disease had its high day; fever, cholera, consumption, smallpox raged.
				Small-pox was especially prevalent; there were deaths in almost every house.
				No one would give water to the sick, no one would touch, no one would treat the disease or tend the
				sufferer; when he died there was no one to dispose of the corpse; the bodies of the beautiful lay
				rotting uncared-for in their terraced mansions.
				For into whatever house the small-pox made its entry the inhabitants fled from it in terror abandoning
				the sick to their fate.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 521</p>
<p class="PE">Mahendra Singh was one of the richest men in the village of Podchinha, but today rich and poor
				were on one and the same level.
				In this time of misery and disease his relatives and dependants, his serving-men, his serving-women, all
				were gone.
				Some had perished, others had fled.
				In all that populous household there was now left only his wife and himself and an infant daughter.
				It was they who were sitting in the darkened chamber.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2092">The wife Kalyani rose from her reflections, went into the cowshed and herself milked the cow.
				Then she warmed the milk, gave her child to drink and went again to give grass and water to the cow.
				When she came back, Mahendra said, “How long can this go on?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2093">She answered “Not long, but let us continue as long as we can.
				Till then I will manage to keep things going; afterwards do you take the child to the town.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2094">“If we must go in the end, why should I put you through all this trouble?
				Let us rather go now.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2095">The two debated the question for a long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2096">Kalyani asked, “Is there anything really to be gained by going?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2097">“Who knows?
				Perhaps the town is as solitary as this village and as empty of all means of subsistence.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2098">“If we go to Murshidabad, Cassimbazaar or Calcutta, we may live.
				No, there is every reason why we should leave this place.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2099">Mahendra replied, “This house has long been full of the stored up wealth of generations.
				All will be plundered by thieves.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2100">“If they came to plunder now, could we two prevent them?
				Unless we live, who will there be to make use of this wealth?
				Come, let us at once shut up everything and go.
				If we live, then we can return and again enjoy life and riches.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2101">Mahendra asked her, “Will you be able to walk all that way?
				The palanquin bearers are dead; where there are bullocks, there is no cartman; where there is a cartman,
				bullocks are not to be had.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2102">“That need not trouble you; I shall walk.”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 522</p>
<p class="PE">In her heart she had resolved that if need be, she would fall down and die by the wayside, but
				these two must live.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2103">Next day at dawn they took some money with them, locked all the doors, loosed the cows, took
				their child in their arms and started for the capital.
				At the time of starting Mahendra said “It is a difficult road and at every step of it robbers are
				wandering in search of their prey; it is well to go armed.”
				He returned into the house and came back with gun, powder and bullets.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2104">Kalyani, when she saw the gun, said to her husband, “Since you have thought of it, take
				Sukumari for a moment.
				I too will have a weapon with me.”
				With this she put her daughter into Mahendra’s arms and entered the house, Mahendra calling after her in
				surprise, “Why, what weapon can you carry?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2105">It was a little box of poison that Kalyani hid in her dress as she came.
				She had been provided for some time with this arm against any ill fate that might befall her in these
				days of adversity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2106">It was the month of Jyestha, and the heat was fierce and pitiless; the earth burned as with
				fire, the wind scattered its flaming breath, the sky was like a canopy of heated bronze, the dust of the
				road like sparks of flame.
				Kalyani began to perspire and walked on with difficulty and suffering; she sat down sometimes under a
				babul tree, sometimes in the shade of a date palm, sometimes she drank the muddy water of a dried-up
				pond.
				Mahendra carried the child in his arms and fanned it from time to time.
				Once they rested in the shade of a creeper-hung tree richly coloured with dark green leaves and fragrant
				with sweet-scented flowers.
				Mahendra wondered at Kalyani’s power of endurance.
				He wet his robe and sprinkled water from a neighbouring pool on his own and Kalyani’s face, feet and
				forehead.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2107">Kalyani was a little refreshed, but both husband and wife were tortured with hunger.
				Their own hunger could be borne, but not the hunger and thirst of their child, so they began again to
				travel forward and making their way through the waves of fire arrived before evening at a hamlet.
				Mahendra was full of hope, for he expected that here he would find cool water to unparch the throats of
				his wife and daughter and food to sustain their </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 523</p>
<p class="PE">lives.
				But no, there was not a man in the place.
				Large houses lay empty; all the inhabitants had fled.
				After searching here and there for a while Mahendra made his wife and child lie down in a room while he
				himself went out and began to call loudly.
				There was no answer.
				Then he said to Kalyani, “Be brave and remain here alone by yourself, I will go and if there is a cow in
				the place, if Srikrishna takes compassion on us, bring some milk for us to drink.”
				So saying, he took up an earthen waterpot in his hand,– there were a great many lying there,– and
				sallied out.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="chapter-ii">Chapter II</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2108">When Mahendra had gone, Kalyani, left alone with her little girl, in that solitary place, in
				that gloomy cottage, began to gaze around her and a growing terror took hold of her mind.
				No one anywhere, no human sound, only the cry of the dog and the jackal.
				She began to think, “Why did I let him go, we might have well borne the pangs of hunger and thirst a
				little longer.”
				Then she thought to rise and shut all the doors, but not a single doorway had shutter or bar.
				As she was thus gazing fearfully around her, she saw something like a shadow in the doorway opposite.
				It looked like a man’s form but hardly seemed to be human.
				Yet it was something like a man, withered, wasted, black, terrible that had come and stood in the
				doorway.
				A little while and the shadow seemed to raise an arm; a very long withered arm, all skin and bone,
				appeared to be beckoning to someone with its long withered fingers.
				Kalyani’s heart in her dried up with fear.
				Then another such shadow, withered, black, tall, naked came and stood beside the first.
				Then another and another joined them, how many others.
				Slowly, silently they began to enter the room, the gloom-haunted cottage grew terrible as a midnight
				burning-ground.
				Those corpse-like phantom-like figures entered and stood in a circle round Kalyani and she half-swooned
				with her terror.
				Then the black emaciated men seized and lifted up the woman and her child and took them up out of the
				house, across the open fields into the thickness of a wood.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 524</p>
<p class="PE">A few moments afterwards Mahendra returned carrying milk in the waterpot.
				He saw no one in the cottage; he searched here and there, he called first his daughter, and at last his
				wife by name, but he received no answer, found no trace.</p>

<h2 class="sub-hd">The Vaishnava Poetess</h2>
<p class="PE">Preoccupied from the earliest times with divine knowledge and religious aspiration the Indian
				mind has turned all forms of human life and emotion and all the phenomena of the universe into symbols
				and means by which the embodied soul may strive after and grasp the Supreme.
				Indian devotion has especially seized upon the most intimate human relations and made them
				stepping-stones to the supra-human.
				God the Guru, God the Master, God the Friend, God the Mother, God the Child, God the Self, each of these
				experiences – for to us they are more than merely ideas,– it has carried to its extreme possibilities.
				But none of them has it pursued, embraced, sung with a more exultant passion of intimate realisation
				than the yearning for God the Lover, God the Beloved.
				It would seem as if this passionate human symbol were the natural culminatingpoint for the mounting
				flame of the soul’s devotion: for it is found wherever that devotion has entered into the most secret
				shrine of the inner temple.
				We meet it in Islamic poetry; certain experiences of the Christian mystics repeat the forms and images
				with which we are familiar in the East, but usually with a certain timorousness foreign to the Eastern
				temperament.
				For the devotee who has once had this intense experience it is that which admits to the most profound
				and hidden mystery of the universe; for him the heart has the key of the last secret.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2187">The work of a great Bengali poet has recently reintroduced this idea to the European mind,
				which has so much lost the memory of its old religious traditions as to welcome and wonder at it as a
				novel form of mystic self-expression.
				On the contrary it is ancient enough, like all things natural and eternal in the human soul.
				In Bengal a whole period of national poetry has </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 578</p>
<p class="PE">been dominated by this single strain and it has inspired a religion and a philosophy.
				And in the Vaishnavism of the far South, in the songs of the Tamil Alwars we find it again in another
				form, giving a powerful and original turn to the images of our old classic poetry; for there it has been
				sung out by the rapt heart of a woman to the Heart of the Universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2188">The Tamil word, Alwar, means one who has drowned, lost himself in the sea of the divine being.
				Among these canonised saints of Southern Vaishnavism ranks Vishnuchitta, Yogin and poet, of Villipattan
				in the land of the Pandyas.
				He is termed <em>Perialwar</em>, the great Alwar.
				A tradition, which we need not believe, places him in the ninety-eighth year of the Kaliyuga.
				But these divine singers are ancient enough, since they precede the great saint and philosopher Ramanuja
				whose personality and teaching were the last flower of the long-growing Vaishnava tradition.
				Since his time Southern Vaishnavism has been a fixed creed and a system rather than a creator of new
				spiritual greatnesses.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2189">The poetess Andal was the foster-daughter of Vishnuchitta, found by him, it is said, a new-born
				child under the sacred tulsi-plant.
				We know little of Andal except what we can gather from a few legends, some of them richly beautiful and
				symbolic.
				Most of Vishnuchitta’s poems have the infancy and boyhood of Krishna for their subject.
				Andal, brought up in that atmosphere, cast into the mould of her life what her foster-father had sung in
				inspired hymns.
				Her own poetry – we may suppose that she passed early into the Light towards which she yearned, for it
				is small in bulk,– is entirely occupied with her passion for the divine Being.
				It is said that she went through a symbolic marriage with Sri Ranganatha, Vishnu in his temple at
				Srirangam, and disappeared into the image of her Lord.
				This tradition probably conceals some actual fact, for Andal’s marriage with the Lord is still
				celebrated annually with considerable pomp and ceremony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2190">We give below a translation of three of Andal’s poems.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="nammalwar-supreme">Nammalwar</h1>
<h2 class="sub-hd">The Supreme Vaishnava Saint and Poet</h2>
<p class="PE">Maran, renowned as Nammalwar (“Our Saint”) among the Vaishnavas and the greatest of their
				saints and poets, was born in a small town called Kuruhur, in the southernmost region of the Tamil
				country – Tiru-nelveli (Tinnevelly).
				His father, Kari, was a petty prince who paid tribute to the Pandyan King of Madura.
				We have no means of ascertaining the date of the Alwar’s birth, as the traditional account is
				untrustworthy and full of inconsistencies.
				We are told that the infant was mute for several years after his birth.
				Nammalwar renounced the world early in life and spent his time singing and meditating on God under the
				shade of a tamarind tree by the side of the village temple.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2205">It was under this tree that he was first seen by his disciple, the Alwar Madhura-kavi,– for the
				latter also is numbered among the great Twelve, “lost in the sea of Divine Love”.
				Tradition says that while Madhura-kavi was wandering in North India as a pilgrim, one night a strange
				light appeared to him in the sky and travelled towards the South.
				Doubtful at first what significance this phenomenon might have for him, its repetition during three
				consecutive nights convinced him that it was a divine summons and where this luminous sign led he must
				follow.
				Night after night he journeyed southwards till the guiding light came to Kuruhur and there disappeared.
				Learning of Nammalwar’s spiritual greatness he thought that it was to him that the light had been
				leading him.
				But when he came to him, he found him absorbed in deep meditation with his eyes fast closed and although
				he waited for hours the Samadhi did not break until he took up a large stone and struck it against the
				ground violently.
				At the noise Nammalwar opened his eyes, but still remained </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 586</p>
<p class="PE">silent.
				Madhura-kavi then put to him the following enigmatical question, “If the little one (the soul) is born
				into the dead thing (Matter)<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="183" href="#">1</a> what will the little one eat
				and where will the little one lie?” to which Nammalwar replied in an equally enigmatic style, “That will
				it eat and there will it lie.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2206">Subsequently Nammalwar permitted his disciple to live with him and it was Madhura-kavi who
				wrote down his songs as they were composed.
				Nammalwar died in his thirty-fifth year, but he has achieved so great a reputation that the Vaishnavas
				account him an incarnation of Vishnu himself, while others are only the mace, discus, conch etc. of the
				Deity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2207">From the philosophical and spiritual point of view, his poetry ranks among the highest in Tamil
				literature.
				But in point of literary excellence, there is a great inequality; for while some songs touch the level
				of the loftiest world-poets, others, even though rich in rhythm and expression, fall much below the
				poet’s capacity.
				In his great work known as the Tiru-vay-moli (the Sacred Utterance) which contains more than a thousand
				stanzas, he has touched all the phases of the life divine and given expression to all forms of spiritual
				experience.
				The pure and passionless Reason, the direct perception in the high solar realm of Truth itself, the
				ecstatic and sometimes poignant love that leaps into being at the vision of the “Beauty of God’s face”,
				the final Triumph where unity is achieved and “I and my Father are one” – all these are uttered in his
				simple and flowing lines with a strength that is full of tenderness and truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="T-2208">The lines which we translate below are a fair specimen of the great Alwar’s poetry; but it has
				suffered considerably in the translation,– indeed the genius of the Tamil tongue hardly permits of an
				effective rendering, so utterly divergent is it from that of the English language.</p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-183"><sup>1</sup> The form of the question reminds one of Epictetus’
					definition of man, “Thou art a little soul carrying about a corpse.”
					Some of our readers may be familiar with Swinburne’s adaptation of the saying, “A little soul for a
					little bears up the corpse which is man.”</p>

				Yet not for all his words would the infatuate heart of Aegisthus<br/>
				Heed that friendly voice; now all in a mass has been paid for.”<br/>
				Answered then to Zeus the goddess grey-eyed Athene.<br/>
				“Father of ours, thou son of Cronus, highest of the regnant,<br/>

				So too perish all who dare like deeds among mortals.<br/>
				But for a far better man my heart burns, clear-eyed Odysseus<br/>
				Who, ill-fated, far from his loved ones suffers and sorrows<br/>
				Hemmed in the island girt by the waves, in the navel of ocean,<br/>
				Where in her dwelling mid woods and caves a goddess inhabits,<br/>
