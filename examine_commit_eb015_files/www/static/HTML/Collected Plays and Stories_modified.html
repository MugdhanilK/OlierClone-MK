<p class="Pi">
<em>Collected Plays and Stories </em>comprises all Sri Aurobindo's
        original dramatic works and works of prose fiction. The

        material, which occupies two volumes, is divided by type
        into three parts: complete plays, incomplete and fragmentary plays, and stories, complete, incomplete and
        fragmentary.
    </p>
<p class="Pi">The earliest of the pieces collected here was written
        in 1891, the latest in 1915. Only one of them, <em>Perseus the Deliverer</em>, was
        published during Sri Aurobindo’s lifetime. The rest have been reproduced from
        his manuscripts.</p>

        Danaë and her child were exposed in a boat without sail or oar on the sea, but here too fate and the gods
        intervened
        and, guided by a divine protection, the boat bore her safely to the Island of Seriphos.
        There Danaë was received and honoured by the King.
        When Perseus had grown to manhood the King, wishing to marry Danaë, decided to send him to his death and to that
        end
        ordered him to slay the Gorgon Medusa in the wild, unknown and snowy North and bring to him her head the sight
        of
        which turned men to stone.
        Perseus, aided by Athene, the Goddess of Wisdom, who gave him the divine sword Herpe, winged shoes to bear him
        through the air, her shield or aegis and the cap of invisibility, succeeded in his quest after many adventures.
        In his returning he came to Syria and found Andromeda, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopea, King and Queen of
        Syria,
        chained to the rocks by the people to be devoured by a sea-monster as an atonement for her mother’s impiety
        against
        the sea-god, Poseidon.
        Perseus slew the monster and rescued and wedded Andromeda.</p>

        In this piece the ancient legend has been divested
        of its original character of a heroic myth; it is made the nucleus round which there could grow the scenes of a
        romantic story of human temperament and life-impulses on the Elizabethan model.
        The country in which the action is located is a Syria of romance, not of history.
        Indeed a Hellenic legend could not at all be set in the environments of the life of a Semitic people and its
        early
        Aramaean civilisation: the town of Cepheus must be looked at as a Greek colony with a blonde Achaean dynasty
        ruling

        In a romantic work of imagination of this type these outrages on history do not matter.
        Time there is more than Einsteinian in its relativity, the creative imagination is its sole disposer and
        arranger;
        fantasy reigns sovereign; the names of ancient countries and peoples are brought in only as fringes of a
        decorative
        background; anachronisms romp in wherever they can get an easy admittance, ideas and associations from all
        climes
        and epochs mingle; myth, romance and realism make up a single whole.
        For here the stage is the human mind of all times: the subject is an incident in its passage from a
        semi-primitive
        temperament surviving in a fairly advanced outward civilisation to a brighter intellectualism and humanism –
        never
        quite safe against the resurgence of the dark or violent life-forces which are always there subdued or
        subordinated
        or somnolent in the make-up of civilised man – and the first promptings of the deeper and higher psychic and
        spiritual being which it is his ultimate destiny to become.

        Alack, poor old Poseidon!
        He has had nothing but goats and sea-urchins lately, and that is poor food for a palate inured to <em>homme à la
            Phénicienne</em>, Diomede.
        It is his own fault, he should provide wreckage more freely.
        But black Polydaon’s forehead grows blacker every day: he will soon be as mad as Cybele’s bull on the headland.
        I am every moment in terror of finding myself tumbled on the altar for a shipwrecked Phoenician and old

        hacking about in search of my heart with his holy carving-tools.

    The action of the romance takes place a century after the war of the Mahabharata; the capital
    has been changed to Cowsamby<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="513" href="#">2</a>; the empire has been temporarily
    broken
    and the kingdoms of India are overshadowed by three powers, Magadha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="514" href="#">3</a> in
    the East ruled by Pradyotha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="515" href="#">4</a>, Avunthy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="516" href="#">5</a> in the West ruled by Chunda Mahasegn who has subdued also the Southern kings,
    and Cowsamby in the
    Centre where Yougundharayan strives by arms and policy to maintain the house of Parikshith<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="517" href="#">6</a> against the dominating power of Avunthy.
    Recently since the young Vuthsa has been invested with the regal power and appeared at [          ]<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="518" href="#">7</a>, Chunda Mahasegn, till then invincible, has suffered rude but
    not decisive
    reverses.
    For the moment there is an armed peace between the two empires.<br/>
    The fable is taken from Somadeva’s
    Kathasaritsagara (the Ocean of the Rivers of Many Tales) and was always a favourite subject of Indian romance
    and
    drama; but some of the circumstances, a great many of the incidents and a few of the names have been altered or
    omitted and others introduced in their place.
    Vuthsa, the name of the nation in the tale, is in the play used as a personal name of the King Udaian<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="519" href="#">8</a>.<br/>

        Tut, you are childish.
        But to speak the bare fact, Ismenia, I think he is most poetically in love with you.
        He made preparations to swoon when he no more than saw<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="966" href="#">111</a> your
        name;
        but I build nothing on that;<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="967" href="#">112</a> there are some faint when they
        smell a
        pinch of garlic or spy a cockchafer.
        But he wasted<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="968" href="#">113</a> ten minutes copying your letter into his heart or
        some
        such note-book of love affairs; yet that was nothing either; I doubt if he found room for you, unless on the
        margin.
        Then he began drawing cheques on Olympus for comparisons, left that presently as antique and out of date,
        confounded
        Ovid and his breviary in the same quest; left that too for mediaeval, and diverged into Light and Heat, but came
        not
        to the very modernness of electricity.
        But Lord!
        Cousin, what a career he ran!
        He had imagined himself blind and breathless when I stopped him.
        I tremble to think what calamities might have ensued, had I not thrown myself under the wheels of his metaphor.
        The upshot is, he loves you, worships you and will come to you.

        I have set Don Cerberus on the stairs out of respect for the mythology.

        rats
        from the cellar; for what other wild beasts there may be to menace us, I know not.
        Don Mario snores hard and Donna Clara plays the violin to his bassoon.

        These men! these men! and yet they call themselves our masters.
        I would I could find a man fit to measure tongues with me.
        I begin to feel lonely in the Alpine elevation of my own wit.
        The meditations of Matterhorn come home to me and I feel a sister to Monte Rosa.

        “Cateran, I will show thee the sum of thy bold and
        flagitious offences, though I dare not to hope that it will make thee ashamed.
        Thou hast laid injurious hands on a royal maiden, being thyself a mere Bheel and outlaw and of no parentage;
        thou
        hast carried me most violently to this thy inconsiderable and incommodious hut, treating the body of a princess
        as
        if it were a sack of potatoes; thou hast unmercifully and feloniously stripped my body with thy own rude Bheel
        hands
        of more ornaments than thou hast seen in thy lifetime and didst hurt me most cruelly in the deed, though thou
        vainly
        deniest it; thou hast compelled and dost yet compel me, the princess of Edur, by the infamous lack of
        women-servants
        in thy hut, to minister to thee, a common Bheel, menially with my own royal hands, so that my fingers are sore
        with
        scrubbing thy rusty sword which thou hast never used yet on anything braver than a hill-jackal, and my face is
        still
        red with leaning over the fire cooking thy most unroyal meals for thee; and to top these crimes, thou hast in
        thy
        robustious robber fashion taken a kiss from my lips without troubling thyself to ask for it, and thou yet
        keepest it
        with thee.
        All which are high misdoings and mortal offences; yet would I have pardoned them knowing thee to be no more than
        a
        boy and a savage.
        But now thou darest to tell me that I, a Rajpoot maiden, am in love with thee, a Bheel, and that even if I deny
        it,
        thou carest not; for I am
    </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 897</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-5981">thine already whether I will or no, thy captive and thy slavegirl.
        This is not to be borne.
        So I have written to my noble suitors of Ichalgurh and Scythia to avenge me upon thy Bheel body; I doubt not,
        they
        will soon carry thy head to Edur in a basket, if thou hast the manners to permit them.
        Yet since thy followers call thee Smiter of the Forest and Lion of the Hills, let me see thee smite more than
        jackals and rend braver than flesh of mountain-deer.
        Cateran, when thou trundlest the Scythian down-hill like a ball, thou mayst marry me in spite of thy misdeeds,
        if
        thou darest; and when thou showest thyself a better man than the Chouhan of Ichalgurh, which is impossible, thou
        mayst even keep me for thy slavegirl and I will not deny thee.
        Meanwhile, thou shalt give me a respite till the seventh morn of the May.

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6279"><b><span class="bukvica">S</span>turge</b> Maynard rose from the fireside and
        looked out on the blackish yellow blinding fog that swathed London in the dense folds of its amplitude.
        In his hand he carried the old book he was reading, his finger was still in the page, his mind directed, not
        with entire satisfaction, to the tenour<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1049" href="#">1</a> of the writer’s
        imaginations.
        For, if these pleased his sense of the curious, they disgusted his reason.
        A mystic, mediaeval in epoch and temperament, the old Latinist dealt with psychological fancies the modern world
        has long discarded in order to bustle to the polling booth and the counting house.
        Numerous subtleties occurred repulsive to the rigid and definite solutions of an age which, masterful with
        knowledge in the positive and external, tries to extend its autocracy in the shape of a confident ignorance over
        the bounds of the occulter<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1050" href="#">2</a> world within, occult – declared the
        author,– only because we reject a key that is in everyone’s hand, himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6280">“Prosaist of mysteries,” thought Sturge, “trafficker in devious imaginations, if
        one could find only the thinnest fact to support the cumbrous web that is here woven!
        But the fog is less thick than the uncertainty in which these thoughts were content to move.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6281">In a passage of unusual but bizarre interest the German mystic maintained that the
        principle of brilliancy attended with a ceaseless activity the motions of thought, which, in their physical
        aspect, are flashes of a pure, a lurid or a murky light.
        It was, he said, a common experience with seers in intense moments of rapid cerebration to see their heads,
        often their whole surroundings besieged by a brilliant atmosphere coruscating with violet lightnings.
        Even while he wondered at these extravagances, it flashed across Sturge’s memory that he himself in his
        childhood had been in the habit of seeing precisely such violet coruscations </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 954</p>
<p class="PE">about his head and had indulged his childish fancy with them until maturer years brought wonder,
        distrust and the rapid waning of the phenomenon.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6282">Was there then some justification of experience for the fancies of the German?
        With an impulse he tried vainly to resist, he fixed his eye piercingly on the fog outside the window and waited.
        At the moment he was aware of a curious motion in his head, a crowding of himself and all his faculties to the
        eye; then came the sight of violet flashes in the fog and a growing excitement in his nerves watched by a brain
        that was curiously, abnormally calm.
        A whole world of miraculous vision, of marvellous sound, of ancient and future experience was surely pressing
        upon him, surging against some barrier that opposed intercourse.
        Astonished and interested, but not otherwise disturbed, his reason attempted to give itself some account of what
        was happening.
        The better to help the effort, he fixed his eye again on the fog for repetition or disproof of what he had seen.
        There were no further violet flashes, but something surely was hinting, forming, manifesting in the grey swathe
        outside.
        It became bright, it became round, it became distinct.
        Was it a face or a globe?
        With a disappointed revulsion of feeling he saw himself face to face with nothing more romantic than a clock.
        He smiled and turned to compare with that strong visualised image<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1051" href="#">3</a>
        his own substantial, unmystic, workday<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1052" href="#">4</a> companion on the
        mantelpiece.
        His body grew tense with a shock of surprise.
        There indeed was the clock, his ebony-faced, gold-lettered recorder of hours, balanced lightly on a conventional
        Father Time in the centre and two winged goddesses at the side<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1053" href="#">5</a>;
        the hands, he noted, were closing upon the twelve and the five, and there would soon ring out the sound of the
        hour.
        But, by its side, what was this phantasmal and unwonted companion, fixed, distinct, aping reality, ebony-faced
        also, but silver-lettered, solidly pedestalled, not lightly balanced, pointing to the hour eight with the same
        closeness as the real clock pointed to the hour five?
        He had time to notice that the four of this timepiece was not lettered in the ordinary Roman numerals, but with
        the four vertical and parallel strokes; then the apparition disappeared.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6283"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 955</p>
<p class="PE">An optical hallucination!
        Probably, the mental image intensely visualised, of some familiar timepiece in a friendly sittingroom.
        Indeed, was it not more than familiar?
        Surely he knew it,– had seen it, daily<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1054" href="#">6</a>, insistently,– that ebony
        face, that silver lettering, that strong ornamented pedestal, even that figure four!
        But where was it, when was it?
        Some curious bar in his memory baffled the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1055" href="#">7</a> mind wandering vainly
        for the lost details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6284">Suddenly the clock, his own clock, struck five.
        He counted mechanically the familiar sounds, sharp, clear, attended with a metallic reverberation.
        And then, before the ear could withdraw itself from its object, another clock began, not sharp, not clear, not
        metallic but with a soft, harmonious chime and a musical jangling at the end.
        And the number of the strokes was eight!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6285">Sturge sat down at the table and opened his book at random.
        If this were a hallucination, it was a carefully arranged and well-executed hallucination.
        Was someone playing hypnotic tricks with his brain?
        Was he hypnotising himself?
        His eye fell on the page and met not mediaeval Latin, but ancient Greek, though unHomeric hexameters.
        Very clear was the lettering, very plain the significance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6286">“For the gods immortal wander always over the earth and come unguessed to the
        dwellings of mortals; but rare is the eye that can look on them and rarer the mind that can distinguish the
        disguise from the deity.”<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1056" href="#">8</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6287">Hypnotism again! for he knew that the original lucubrations of the old mystic,
        subtle in substance, but in expression rough, tedious,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1057" href="#">9</a> amorphous,
        persisted<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1058" href="#">10</a> from the beginning to the end in their crabbed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1059" href="#">11</a> Latin and deviated<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1060" href="#">12</a> nowhere into Greek, flowered nowhere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1061" href="#">13</a> into
        poetry.
        There was yet more of the hexameters<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1062" href="#">14</a>, he noticed, and he read
        on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6288">“And men too live disguised in the sunlight and never from their birth to their
        death shalt thou see the mask uplifted.
        Nay, </p>

<p class="PE">thou thyself, O Pelops, hast thou seen even once the daemon within thee?”<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1063" href="#">15</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6289">There the hexameters ceased and the next moment the physical page reappeared with
        its native lettering.
        But sweet, harmonious, clear in his hearing jangled once more the chimes of the phantom hour.
        And again the number of strokes was eight.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6290">Sturge Maynard rose and waited for some more definite sign.
        For he divined now that some extraordinary mental state, some unforgettable experience was upon him.
        His expectation was not deceived.
        Once more the chimes rang out, but this time it seemed to him as if a woman’s voice were crying to him
        passionately under cover of that perfectly familiar melody.
        But were the two phantasmal sounds memories of this English land and birth or was it out of some past existence
        they challenged him, insisting and appealing, inviting him to remember some poignant hour of a form he had worn
        and discarded, a name he had answered to and forgotten?
        Whatever it was, it was near to him, it touched potently his heart-strings.
        And then immediately following the eighth stroke there came, as if far off, an unmistakable explosion of sound,
        the report of a modern revolver.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6291">Sturge Maynard left the fireplace and the room, descended the stairs, put on his
        hat and overcoat, and moved towards the door of his house.
        He had no clear idea where he would go or what he must do, but whatever it might be, it had to be done.
        Then it occurred to him that he had forgotten his revolver which was lying in the drawer of his wardrobe.
        He went up, possessed himself of the weapon, loaded it, put it in his right-hand side pocket, assured himself
        that the pocket carried his two latchkeys, once more descended the stairs and walked out into one of the densest
        of London fogs, damp, choking and impenetrable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6292">He moved through a world that seemed to have no existence </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 957</p>
<p class="PE">except in memory.
        There was no speed of traffic.
        Only an occasional cartman hoarsely announced from time to time the cautious progress of his vehicle.
        Sturge could not see anything before or around him,– except when he neared the curb and a lamppost strove to
        loom<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1064" href="#">16</a> out on him shadowily or on the other side a spectral
        fragment of wall brushed his coatsleeve.
        But he was certain of the pavement under his feet, and he felt he could make no false turn.
        A surer guide than his senses and memory led him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6293">He crossed the road, entered the gates of Hyde Park, traversed in a sure and
        straight line of advance the fogbound invisible open, passed through the Marble Arch, and in Oxford Street, for
        the first time, hesitated.
        There were two women who were dear to him, either of whom by her death could desolate half his existence.
        To whom should he go?
        Then his mind, or something within it, decided for him.
        These speculations were otiose.
        He need not go to his sister Imogen.
        What possible evil could happen to her in her uncle’s well-appointed, well-guarded comfortable home, in the
        happy round of her life full of things innocently careless and harmlessly beautiful.
        But Renée!
        Renée was different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6294">He pursued his walk in a familiar direction.
        As he went, it flashed across his memory that she had forbidden him to visit her today.
        There was some living reminiscence of her past life coming to her, someone she did not care for Sturge to meet,
        she had said with her usual frank carelessness; he must not come.
        He had not questioned.
        Since he first knew her, he had never questioned, and the past of Renée Beauregard was a void even for the man
        to whom she had surrendered everything.
        There was room in that void for unusual incidents, supreme perils.
        He remembered now that her parting clasp had been almost convulsive in its strength and intensity, her speech
        vibrant with some unexplained emotion.
        He had been aware of it without observing it, being preoccupied with his passion.
        Whatever part of his mind had noted it, had confined its possible cause within the limits of the usual, as men
        are in the habit of doing, ignoring the unusual until it seizes and surprises them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6295">He reached the square and the house in which she lived, </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 958</p>
<p class="PE">opened the door with one of the latchkeys in his pocket, divested himself of his coat and hat, and
        directed his steps to the drawingroom.
        A girl of nineteen or twenty rose, calm and pale, fronting the open doorway.
        The clutch of her hand on the chair, the rigid forward impulse in her frame were the index of a great emotion
        and an intense expectation.
        But her face flushed, the hand and figure relaxed, when she saw her visitor.
        Renée Beauregard was a Frenchwoman of the South, rich in physical endowment, in nervous vitality, in the élan of
        her tongue and her spirit.
        Her exquisite<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1065" href="#">17</a> full limbs, her buoyant gait, the mobility of her
        crimson lips, her smiling dark eyes made great demands on life, on success, on pleasure, on love.
        But in the invincibly happy flame of the eyes there was at the moment the shadow of a tragic disappointment
        haunting and disfiguring their natural expression.
        This was plainly a woman with a past,– and a present.
        And her nature, if not her fate, demanded a future.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6296">“Sturge!”
        She took a step towards the door.
        Sturge walked over to the fireplace and took her hand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6297">“I forgot your prohibition till I was too near to turn back.
        And there was the fog; and return was cheerless and you were here!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6298">“You should not have forgotten!” she said, but she smiled, well-pleased at his
        coming.
        Then the dark look reusurped those smiling eyes.
        “And you must go back.
        No, not now.
        In a quarter of an hour.
        You may stop for quarter of an hour.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6299">She had glanced at the clock, and his eyes followed hers.
        He saw an ebony-faced timepiece, silver-lettered, solidly-pedestalled, rendering the figure four in parallel
        strokes, and smiled at the curious tricks that his memory had played him.
        It was five minutes past six.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6300">“I will go to Imogen’s,” he said, very deliberately.
        She looked at him, looked at the clock, then cried impulsively, leaning towards him: “And you will come at eight
        and dine with me!
        Rachel shall lay the covers for two,” then drew back, as if repenting her invitation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6301">Eight!
        Yes, he would dine with her – after he had done his work.
        That seemed to be the arrangement,– not hers, but </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 959</p>
<p class="PE">whose?
        The daemon’s perhaps, the god’s, within or without.
        They sat talking for a while, and it seemed to him that never had their talk been so commonplace in form or so
        vibrant with emotion.
        At twenty past six he rose, took his farewell and moved out to the fog; but she followed him to the door, helped
        him on with his overcoat, trembling visibly as she did so.
        And before he went, she embraced and kissed him once, not vehemently, but with a strong quietude and as if
        some<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1066" href="#">18</a> fateful resolution had<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1067" href="#">19</a> at that moment been formed in her heart, and expressed itself in her caress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6302">“I shall be back by eight,” he said quietly.
        He had accepted, but not returned her embrace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6303">By eight!
        Yes, and before.
        But he did not tell her that.
        He swung through the fog to his uncle’s residence, with a light, clear and careless mind, but an intense quiet
        in his heart.
        He reached the place, in a very aristocratic neighbourhood, and was invited in by a portly footman.
        Sir John was out, at the House, but Miss Imogen Maynard was at home.
        The next hour Sturge passed calmly and lightly enough; for in his sister’s everyday attractive personal talk
        coursing lightly over the surface of life, amusements and theatres, books, music, paintings varied with politics
        and a shade of politely hinted scandal, even his heart insensibly lost its tension and he slipped<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1068" href="#">20</a> back into the usual, forgetting the within in the without.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6304">The next hour and more.
        It was Imogen Maynard who rose and said:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6305">“Ten minutes to eight, Sturge.
        I must go and dress.
        You are sure you won’t dine?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6306">Sturge Maynard looked at the clock and his heart stood still.
        He bid his sister a hasty adieu, ran down the stairs, clutched his hat and coat and was out in the fog, donning
        his overcoat as he walked.
        He made sure of the revolver and the latchkeys, then broke into a run.
        His great dread was that he might lose the turning in his haste and arrive after the stroke of the hour.
        But it was difficult to miss it, the only open space for half a mile!
        And the daemon? was he a spirit of prophecy only?
        Did he not visit to save?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6307"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 960</p>
<p class="PE">He turned into Renée’s square and, as he strode to the house and ascended the steps, the agitation
        passed from him and it was with an even pulse and a steady nerve that he turned to the drawingroom door.
        He had flung aside his hat but not waited to divest himself of the coat.
        His hand was in the pocket and the butt of the revolver was in his hand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6308">The door was open and, unusual circumstance, veiled by the Japanese screen.
        He stood at its edge and looked into the room which was intensely still, but not untenanted – for on the rug
        before the fireplace, at either end of it, stood Renée Beauregard and a man unknown to Sturge.
        He looking at her as if waiting for her speech; she calm, pale, resolute in silence, with the heavy burden of
        her past in her eyes.
        The stranger’s back was half turned to Sturge and only part of his profile was visible, but the Englishman
        quivered with his hatred even as he looked at him.
        Was this what he had to do?
        He took out the revolver and put his finger on the trigger.
        Then he glanced at the clock,– it wanted four minutes to the hour; and at the stranger again,– in his hand, too,
        was a revolver and his finger also rested on the trigger.
        Sturge Maynard smiled.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6309">Then the man’s voice was heard.
        “It has to be then, Idalie!” he said, in a thin, terrible, mournful plaint, “You have decided it.
        Don’t bear any grudge.
        You know it can’t be helped.
        You have to die.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6310">Sturge remembered that Idalie was Renée’s second name, but she had always
        forbidden him to use it.
        The thin voice continued, this time with a note of curious excitement in its plaintiveness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6311">“And you throw it all on me!
        What does it matter how I got you, what I did afterwards?
        Everything’s allowed to a lover.
        And I loved you.
        It’s dangerous to play with love, Idalie.
        You find it now!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6312">Sturge looked at the man.
        Danger for her there was none, but great danger for this rigid, thin-voiced assassin, this man whom Sturge
        Maynard hated with every muscle in his body, with every cell of his brain.
        It seemed to him that each limb of him greatened and vibrated with the energy of the homicide, </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 961</p>
<p class="PE">with the victorious impulse to slay.
        There was a fog outside, what a fog! and he could easily dispose of the body.
        Really that was a good arrangement.
        God did things very cleverly sometimes.
        And he laughed in himself at the grimness of his conceit.
        Yet somehow he believed it.
        God’s work, not his.
        And yet his, too, preordained – since when?
        But the doomed voice was going on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6313">“I give you still a chance, Idalie – always, always a chance.
        Will you go with me?
        You’ve been false to me, false with your body, false with your heart.
        But I’ll forgive.
        I forgave<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1069" href="#">21</a> your desertion, I’ll forgive this too.
        Come with me, Idalie.
        And if not,– Renée Idalie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1070" href="#">22</a>, it is going to strike eight, and when
        the hour has done striking, I strike.
        It’s God shoots you with this hand of mine,– the God of Justice, the God of Love.
        It’s both you have offended.
        Will you come?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6314">She shook her head.
        A deadly pallor swept over the man.
        “It’s done then,” he cried, “you’ve done it.
        You have got to die.”
        He trained the pistol on her and his finger closed on the trigger.
        Sturge remained motionless.
        Nothing could happen before the hour struck.
        That was the moment destined, and no one could outrun Fate by a second.
        The man went on:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6315">“Don’t say it till the clock strikes!
        There’s time till then.
        When I shoot you, Rachel will run up and I will shoot her.
        I left the door open so that she might hear the sound.
        Who else in England knows that I exist?
        I shall go out – oh, when you are both dead, not before.
        There’s a fog, there’s not a soul about, and I shall walk away very quietly.
        No one will see, no one will hear.
        God with his fog has blinded and deafened the world.
        You see it’s He or it would not have been so perfectly arranged for me.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6316">Very grimly Sturge Maynard smiled.
        Men who hated each other might, it seemed, have very similar minds.
        Perhaps that was why they clashed.
        Well, if it was God, He was a tragic artist too and knew the poetical effectiveness of dramatic irony!
        Everything this man reckoned on or had arranged for his deed and his safety, had been or would be helpful to his
        own executioner!
        And then the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1071" href="#">23</a> consciousness came<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1072" href="#">24</a> upon him that this had all happened before.
        But not here, not in these English surroundings!
        A great </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 962</p>
<p class="PE">blur of green came before his eyes, obscuring the clock.
        Then it leaped on him – green grass, green trees, green-covered rocks, a green sea and on the sward a man face
        downward, stabbed in the back, over him his murderer, the stiletto fresh-stained with blood.
        A boat rocked on the waters; it had been arranged for the assassin’s escape, and in it there lay a woman, bound.
        Sturge knew those strange faces very well and remembered how he had lain dead on that sward.
        It was strange to see it all again in this drawingroom with the fateful modern ebony-faced timepiece seen
        through the green of Mediterranean trees!
        But it was going to end very differently this time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6317">Then the voice of the woman rang out, cold, strong, like the clang of iron.
        “I will not go,” she said, simply.
        And the hour struck.
        It struck once, it struck twice, thrice, four times.
        And then she lifted her eyes and saw Sturge Maynard walking forward from the side of the screen.
        He was a good shot and there was no chance of his bungling it and killing her.
        But he would make sure!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6318">The woman in her intensity had summoned up a marvellous self-control, and it did
        not break now; she neither moved, nor uttered a sound.
        But a look came into her eyes poignant in its appeal, terrible in its suggestion.
        For it was a cry for life, a command to murder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6319">The doomed man was looking at the clock, not at her, still less at any possible
        danger behind.
        He looked up as the eighth musical jangle died away and Sturge saw his light, steady, cruel eyes gleaming like
        those of a beast.
        He pressed his finger on the trigger.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6320">“It is finished!” cried the man.
        And as he spoke, Sturge Maynard fired.
        The room rang with the shot, filled with the smoke.
        When the smoke cleared, the stranger was seen prostrate on the rug: his head lay at the feet of the woman he had
        doomed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6321">There was a running of steps in the passage and the maid Rachel entered,– as the
        man who lay there had foreseen.
        She was trembling when she came, but she saw the man on the rug, paused, steadied herself, and smiled.
        “We must carry it out at once into the fog,” she said simply in French.
        With </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 963</p>
<p class="PE">a simultaneous impulse both she and Sturge approached the corpse.
        Then Renée, breaking into excited motion, ran to Sturge and putting her hand on his shoulder made as if to push
        him out of the room.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6322">“I will see to that!” she panted, “Go!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6323">He turned to her with a smile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6324">“You must go at once,” she reiterated, “For my sake, do not be found in this
        house.
        Others besides Rachel may have heard the shot.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6325">But he took her by the wrists, drew her away from the fireplace and set her in a
        chair.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6326">“We lose time, Monsieur,” said Rachel, again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6327">“It is better to lose time, Rachel,” he said, “we will give ten minutes to Fate.”
        And the serving-woman nodded and proceeding to the corpse began to tie up the wound methodically in her apron.
        The others waited in absolute stillness, Sturge arranging in his mind the explanation he would give, if any had
        heard the report and broke in on them.
        But silence and fog persisted around the house.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6328">They took up the body.
        “If anyone notices, we are carrying a drunken man home,” said Sturge.
        “Carry it carefully; there must be no trail of blood.”
        And so into the English fog they carried out the man who had come living from foreign lands, and laid him down
        in the public road, far from the house and the square where he had perished.
        When they returned to the room, Rachel took up the bloodstained rug and apron, sole witnesses of the thing that
        had been done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6329">“I will destroy these,” she said, “and bring the rug from Madame’s room.
        And then,” she said, as simply as before, “Monsieur and Madame will dine.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6330">Renée shuddered and looked at Sturge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6331">“I remain here,” he said, “till the body is found.
        We are linked henceforth indissolubly and for ever, Idalie.”
        And as he stressed lightly the unwonted name, there was a look in his eyes she dared not oppose.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6332">That night, when Renée had gone to her room, Sturge, sitting over the fire,
        remembered that he had not told her the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 964</p>
<p class="PE">strange incident which had brought about one tragedy today and prevented another.
        When he went into her chamber, she came to him, deeply agitated, and clasped him with violence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6333">“Oh, Sturge, Sturge!” she cried, “to think that if you had not chanced to come, I
        should be dead now, taken from you, taken from God’s beautiful world!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6334">Chanced!
        There is no such thing in this creation as chance, thought Sturge.
        But who then<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1073" href="#">25</a> had given him that mystic warning?
        Who had put the revolver in his hand? or sent him on a mission of slaughter?
        Who had made Imogen rise just in time?
        Who had fired that shot in the drawingroom?
        The God within?
        The God without?
        The Easterns spoke of God in a man.
        This might well be He.
        And then there returned to his memory those fierce emotions, the hatred that had surged in him, the impulse and
        delight of slaughter, the song of exultation that his blood yet sang in his veins, because a man that had lived,
        was dead and could not return to life again.
        He remembered, too, the command in Renée’s eyes.
        God in a man? – was God in a man a murderer then?
        In him? and in her?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6335">“It is to enquire too curiously to think so,” he concluded, “but very strangely
        indeed has He made His world.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6336">Then he told her about the German mystic and the chime of the phantom hour that
        had brought him to her in the tragic moment of their destinies.
        And when he spoke of the daemon within, the woman understood better than the man.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-door-at-abelard-i">The Door at Abelard</h1>
<h2 class="Cp-Hd">CHAPTER I</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6338">The village of Streadhew lay just under the hill, a collection of brown solid
        cottages straggling through the pastures, and on the top of the incline Abelard with its gables and antique
        windows watched the road wind and drop slowly to the roofs of Orringham two miles away.
        For many centuries the house and the village had looked with an unchanged face on a changing world, and in their
        old frames housed new men and manners, while Orringham beyond adapted itself and cast off its mediaeval slough.
        The masters of Abelard lived with the burden of a past which they could not change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6339">Stephen Abelard of Abelard, the last male of his line, had lived in the house with
        the old gables for the past twenty years mixing formally in the society of his equals, discharging the
        activities incidental to his position with a punctilious conscientiousness, but withdrawn in soul from the life
        around him.
        That was since the death of his wife in childbirth followed soon afterwards by the fading of the son to give
        whom she had died.
        Two daughters, Isabel and Aloÿse, survived.
        Stephen Abelard did not marry again; he was content that the old line should be continued through the female
        side, and when his daughter Isabel married Richard Lancaster, the younger son of a neighbouring country family,
        he stipulated that the husband should first consent to bear the name of his wife’s ancestors.
        This attachment to the old name was the one<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1074" href="#">1</a> thing known in the
        lord of the old house that belonged to the past.
        For Stephen Abelard, in spite of his spiritual aloofness, was a man forward in thought, with a keen emancipated
        intellect which neither present nor past dogma could bind, and gifted with a high courage to act according to
        the light that he had.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6340"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 966</p>
<p class="PE">A strange series of accidents had helped to bring the old family near to extinction.
        For the last hundred years no daughter-in-law of the house had been able to survive by many days the birth of
        her first male child.
        Girl-children had been born and no harm had happened but some fatality seemed to attend the birth of a son.
        Stephen’s great-grandfather had male issue, Hugh and Walter, and one daughter, Bertha, who died tragically,
        murdered in her chamber, no one knew by whom.
        It was after this incident that the fatality seemed to weigh on the house and popular superstition was not slow
        to connect the fatality with the deed.
        Hugh Abelard had already a wife and two sons at the time<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1075" href="#">2</a> of the
        occurrence, but Walter was unmarried.
        One year after the tragic and mysterious death of his sister he brought a bride home to Abelard and in yet
        another year a son had been born to him.
        But only seven days after the birth of her child Mary Abelard was found dead in her room, possibly from some
        unexplained shock to the heart, for she was strong and in good health when she perished, and Walter, unhinged by
        the death of his young wife, went into foreign lands where he too died.
        The tongues of the countryside did not hesitate to whisper that he only paid in his affliction the penalty of an
        undetected crime.
        Hugh’s sons grew up and married, but the same fatality fell upon the unions they had contracted; they died early
        and their sons did not live to enjoy the estate they successively inherited.
        Then Walter Abelard’s son came with his wife and daughter and took possession.
        Stephen was born two years later and within three days of his birth his mother had shared the fate of all women
        who married into the fated house.
        So strong was the impression made upon Richard Abelard by this fate or this strong recurrent coincidence that
        when he married again, he would not allow his wife to enter the home of his ancestors.
        He bought a house in the neighbouring county and lived there till his death from an accident in the
        hunting-field.
        After him Stephen reigned, a man modern-minded, full of energy and courage, who returned, scornful of antiquated
        superstitions, to the old family house, married and had two daughters, and then
        — well, coincidence insisted and the male child came and the mother, adored of her</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 967</p>
<p class="PE">
        husband, passed away.
        But there was no mystery about this death.
        She died of collapse after childbirth, her life fought for by skilful doctors, watched over by careful
        attendants, sleeplessly guarded at night by her husband.
        A coincidence, nothing more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6341">Therefore Isabel and Richard Lancaster Abelard came fearlessly to live at the
        fated house.
        The daughters of the house had been immune from any fatality, and when she became enceinte, no superstitious
        fears haunted the mind of any among the numerous<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1076" href="#">3</a> friends and
        relatives who loved her for her charm and her gaiety.
        About three months before the birth of the child could be expected her sister Aloÿse married, not as the
        Abelards had hitherto done, into the neighbouring families, but, contrary to all precedent, a young foreign
        doctor settled at Orringham, a man not only foreign, but of Asiatic blood.
        Popular as Dr. Armand Sieurcaye was in the neighbourhood, the alliance had come with something of a shock to the
        countryside; for the Abelards, though less wealthy than many, were the oldest of the county<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1077" href="#">4</a> families.
        But neither Abelard nor his daughter were troubled with these prejudices.
        The young man had powerfully attracted them both and the marriage was as much the choice of the father as of the
        daughter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6342">Armand Sieurcaye came from the south of France, and there was only the glossy
        blackness of his hair and the richer tint of the olive in his face to suggest a non-European origin.
        His grandfather, son of the mixed alliance of a Maratha Sirdar with the daughter of a French adventurer in the
        service of Scindia, had been the first to settle in France purchasing an estate in Provence with the riches
        amassed and hoarded by battle and plunder on Indian soil.
        Armand<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1078" href="#">5</a> was the younger of two sons and had studied medicine at
        Nancy and then, driven rather by some adventurous strain in his blood than any necessity, sought his fortune
        abroad.
        He went first to Bombay, but did little there beyond some curious investigations which interested his keen,
        sceptical and inquiring mind, but did not help his purse.
        At Bombay, he met John Lancaster, Richard’s brother, and was induced by him to try his fortune in the English
        county<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1079" href="#">6</a> town aided by whatever local influence his friend, plucked
        by an almost </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 968</p>
<p class="PE">miraculous cure from the grip of a fatal disease, could afford him in gratitude for the saving of his
        life.
        In twelve months Armand Sieurcaye had won for himself universal popularity, a lucrative practice, and Aloÿse
        Abelard.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6343">The old house, bathed in spring sunshine, had little in it of the ominous or weird
        to Armand Sieurcaye when with his young wife he entered it for a lengthened stay in the month of Isabel’s
        delivery.
        He was attracted by its old-world quaintness, by the mass of the green ivy smothering the ancient walls, by the
        heavenward question of its short pointed towers; but there was nothing there to alarm or to daunt.
        Isabel had hurried to the study to her father, and Armand guided by Richard<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1080" href="#">7</a> Lancaster repaired to the room into which the domestics had already carried his belongings.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6344">“Awfully good of you to leave your practice and come,” said Lancaster, “It’s a
        relief to have you.
        Herries<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1081" href="#">8</a> is a fool and I’m not used to the worry.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6345">Armand looked at him with some surprise.
        He had not expected even so much nervousness<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1082" href="#">9</a> in his cheerful,
        vigorous, commonplace brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6346">“Is there any trouble?” he asked lightly, “Isabel seems strong.
        There can’t be any reason for fear.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6347">“Oh, there isn’t.
        But I tell you, I’m not used to the worry,” and, then, starting off from the subject, “How do you like your
        room?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6348">Armand had not looked at his room, but he looked at it now.
        It was a comfortable, well-furnished room with nothing apparently unmodern about it except the old oak panelling
        of the walls and the unusual narrowness and length of the two windows that looked out on the grounds behind the
        house.
        His eyes fell on a door in the wall to his right hand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6349">“What’s there?” he asked.
        “I thought the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1083" href="#">10</a> room was the last at this end of the house.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6350">“I haven’t any idea,” was the indifferent answer.
        “It can’t be anything more than a balcony or closet.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6351">The door attracted Armand’s attention strangely.
        Of some slighter wood, not of the oak with which Abelard abounded, it </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 969</p>
<p class="PE">was carved with great plainness and struck him as more modern than the rest of the house.
        Still it was not precisely a modern door.
        He walked over to it to satisfy his curiosity, but the attempt to turn the handle brought no result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6352">“Locked?” questioned Lancaster, a little surprised.
        He too sauntered over and turned the handle in vain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6353">“I hope it’s not a haunted chamber,” said Armand, making the useless attempt
        again.
        He had spoken carelessly and was not prepared for the unwonted ebullition that followed his words.
        Richard’s face darkened, he struck the floor with his heel, angrily.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6354">“It’s a beastly house,” he cried.
        “When old Stephen dies, I’ll sell it for a song.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6355">More and more surprised, Armand turned to look closely at his brother-in-law.
        It might be his fancy which told him that the young man’s face was paler than ordinarily and an uneasy restless
        look leaped from time to time into the shallowness of his light blue eyes.
        It was certainly his fancy which said that Richard looked as an animal might look when it is aware of some
        hidden enemy hunting it.
        He dismissed the imagination immediately, and put away from him the thought of the door.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6356">But it occurred to him again when, returning from a solitary walk in the grounds,
        he chanced to look up at<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1084" href="#">11</a> the angle of the house occupied by his
        room and the locked closet or balcony<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1085" href="#">12</a>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6357">A corner of wall there did jut out beyond what he judged to be the limit of his
        room and then curved lightly round and formed a porch supporting a small room that could not have been more than
        eight feet by twelve in size; over the room a peaked tower.
        The erection was meant to imitate and harmonise with the older pointed towers of the building, but a slight
        observation confirmed the Doctor’s surmise that here was a later excrescence inharmoniously added for some whim
        or personal convenience.
        But the ivy was unusually thick on this side and even covered the great carved and high-arched orifices that all
        along the length of the erection did duty for windows.
        It must then be rather in the nature of a closed balcony than a room.
        It struck him casually how easy it would be for an intruder to climb up the strong thick growths of ivy from
        outside and enter </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 970</p>
<p class="PE">the house by the balcony.
        The possibility, no doubt, explained the locked door.
        Greatly relieved, he knew not why, Armand continued his walk.
        But he thought of the door idly more than once before nightfall.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6358">That night, Armand Sieurcaye, sleeping by the side of his wife, was awakened by
        what seemed to him a noise in or outside his room.
        The lamp was burning low but nothing stirred in the dimness of the room.
        His eyes fell on the locked door and a disagreeable attraction rivetted them upon it; to his newly-awakened
        senses there seemed to be something weird and threatening in the plain mass of wood.
        With a violent effort he flung the fancy from him and sought slumber again; the noise that awakened him was
        possibly some figment of senses bewildered by sleep.
        He knew not after how long an interval he again woke, but this time a cold air upon him, and before he opened
        unwilling eyes, he was aware of the door of<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1086" href="#">13</a> his room being
        softly opened and closed.
        Still the lamp burned,— the room was empty.
        Involuntarily his eyes sought the locked door.
        It was swung back on its hinges, wide open<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1087" href="#">14</a>!
        And if the closed door had alarmed something sensitive and irrational within him, how much ghastlier, more
        menacing seemed that open rectangle with the pit of darkness beyond!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6359">Cursing his nerves for fools Armand Sieurcaye leaped from the bed, turned up the
        lamp and, conquering a nervous reluctance the violence of which surprised him, stood, lamp in hand, at the
        threshold of the darkness beyond.
        It was, as he had conjectured, a wide balcony walled in so as to form a habitable sitting or sleeping-room in
        summer, and it seemed as such to have been utilised; for a bare iron bedstead occupied the width of the room
        near the wall, an old armchair with faded and tarnished cushions stood against the opposite end of the room.
        But the arched orifices were now heavily curtained with the thick folds of the climbing ivy.
        Otherwise the room was entirely empty.
        He decided to look out from these windows into the moonlit world outside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6360">But as he advanced into the room, he was aware of a growing disorder in his nerves
        which he could not control.
        It was </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 971</p>
<p class="PE">not fear, so much as an intense horror and hatred
        — of what, he could not determine, but, it almost seemed to him, of that bare iron bed, of that faded armchair.
        In any case, he carefully kept his full distance from both as he crossed the room to the ivied openings and
        thrusting aside part of those green curtains peered into the night.
        A great world of dark green flooded with moonlight met his eyes.
        And then he noticed in the moonlight a man standing in the grounds of Abelard looking up at the balcony with a
        hand shading his eyes.
        It was Richard Lancaster Abelard, heir of the old house, he who knew nothing of the door and the balcony.
        And then the strong descendant of old French and Maratha fighters recoiled as if he had received a blow.
        He did not look again but hastily crossed the balcony and entered his room casting a glance of loathing as he
        passed to each side of him, once at the iron bed, once at the disused armchair.
        He could almost have sworn that a shadowy form lay propped upon shadowy pillows on the old iron bed, that
        somebody looked at him ironically from the tarnished cushions of the chair.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6361">Wondering at himself Armand put on a dressing gown and sat down in an easy chair.
        “I must have it out with my nerves,” he said, resolutely<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1088" href="#">15</a>;
        “Whoever entered my room and opened the door, will, I feel sure, return to close it; I will wait, I will see him
        and prove to my nerves what unspeakable superstitious idiots they are.
        There is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1089" href="#">16</a> nothing strange in Richard Lancaster being out there in
        the moonlight; no doubt, he could not sleep and was taking a stroll outside to help pass away some sleepless
        hours.
        What I saw in him, was an optical effect of the moonlight
        — nothing more, I tell you, nothing more.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6362">For about half an hour he kept his vigil.
        As he sat his mind left its present surroundings and turned to the experiments in occultism he had conducted in
        Bombay.
        From his childhood he had been a highly imaginative lad with a nervous system almost as sensitive as an
        animal’s.
        But if Armand Sieurcaye had the nervous temperament of the Asiatic mystic, his brain had been invincibly
        sceptical not only with the material French scepticism but with the merciless Indian scepticism which, once
        aroused, is far more obstinate and searching than its grosser European </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 972</p>
<p class="PE">shadow.
        Refusing to accept secondhand proof, however strong, and aware of his own rich nervous endowment, he had himself
        experimented in occult science with the double and inconsistent determination to be rigidly fair to the
        supernatural and allow it to establish itself if it existed, and, secondly, to destroy and disprove it for ever
        by the very fairness and thoroughness of his experiments.
        He had been able to establish as undoubtedly existing in himself a fair power of correct presentiment, but
        against this he had to set a number of baulked presentiments; he therefore dismissed the gift as merely a lively
        power of divining the trend of events.
        He was also aware that his personal attractions and repulsions were practically unerring; but, after all, was
        not this merely the equivalent in man to the instinct which so often warns children and animals of their friends
        and enemies?
        It was probable that the adventurous life of his Maratha forefathers, compelled to be always on the alert
        against violence and treachery, had stamped the instinct deep into the hereditary temperament of their issue.
        All the rest of the phenomena<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1090" href="#">17</a> valued by occultists<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1091" href="#">18</a> he had, he thought, proved to be sensory<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1092" href="#">19</a> hallucinations or inordinate subconscious cerebral activity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6363">In the course of his reflections he returned suddenly to his immediate
        surroundings and, with a start, looked towards the balcony-chamber.
        The<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1093" href="#">20</a> door was closed, that had been open!
        There it stood shut, plain, dumb, denying that it had ever been anything else.
        Amazed, Armand leaped to his feet, strode to the door and turned the handle, ignoring a cry within that
        commanded him to desist.
        The door yielded not; it was not only closed but locked.
        Was it possible for any human being to have crossed his room, closed that door and locked it, under his very
        eyes and yet without his knowledge?
        Then he remembered the completeness of his absorption and how utterly his mind had withdrawn into itself.
        “Nothing wonderful in that!” he said.
        “How often have I been oblivious to time and space and circumstance<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1094" href="#">21</a> outside when absorbed in a train of thoughts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1095" href="#">22</a>
        or in an experiment.”
        The<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1096" href="#">23</a> visitor must have thought him<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1097" href="#">24</a> asleep in the easy chair and moved quietly.
        There was nothing more to be done that night and he returned, baffled, to his slumbers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6364"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 973</p>
<p class="PE">The first man he met next morning was Richard Lancaster who greeted him with his usual shallow and
        cheerful cordiality.
        There was no trace of yesterday’s disturbance in his look or demeanour.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6365">“Slept well?” asked Armand casually, but carefully watching his features.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6366">“Like a top!” answered Richard, heartily.
        “Didn’t raise my head once from the pillow from eleven to seven.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6367">Wondering Armand passed him and entered the library.
        Stephen Abelard sat deep in the pages of a book; a cup of tea stood untasted beside his elbow.
        After some ordinary conversation suggested by the book, Armand suddenly questioned his father-in-law:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6368">“By the way, sir, is there a room next to mine?
        I noticed a locked door between.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6369">Stephen Abelard’s eyes narrowed a little and he looked at his questioner before he
        replied.
        He had raised the cup of tea to his lips, but he put it down still untasted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6370">“Disturbed?” he questioned, sharply.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6371">“Not at all,” parried Armand.
        “Why should I be?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6372">“Why indeed?
        You don’t believe in the supernatural.
        Who does?
        But in our nerves and imaginations we are all of us the fools our ancestors made us.
        I had better tell you.”
        Stephen Abelard began sipping his tea and then pursued with a careful deliberateness.
        “The room you sleep<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1098" href="#">25</a> in was the chamber occupied by the
        unfortunate girl, Bertha Abelard, with whose name scandal in her life and superstition after her death have been
        busy.
        You’ve heard all that nonsense about the curse on Abelard.
        I need not repeat the rubbish.
        But this is true that only two people have slept in the balcony-chamber since her death.
        One was a guest, and he refused to sleep there after the first night.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6373">“Why?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6374">“Nervous imaginations!
        Somebody resenting his presence, somebody in the armchair opposite.

<p class="PE">“And he
        — ”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6377">“Was found dead in the iron bed the next morning.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6378">Armand Sieurcaye quivered like a horse struck by the lash.
        He restrained himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6379">“Any cause?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6380">“Failure of the heart.
        The Abelards are subject to failure of the heart.
        Might it not have happened equally in any other room?
        It has so happened, in fact, more than once.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6381">Armand nodded.
        Hereditary weakness of the heart!
        It might very well be.
        But what then was Richard Lancaster or the hallucination of him doing outside in the moonlight?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6382">“Since that death, out of deference to prejudices the balcony is kept locked and
        opened twice a week only when Roberts takes the key of the door from Isabel and cleans up.
        Roberts has no nerves.
        She believes in the ghost, but argues she, ‘Miss Bertha won’t hurt me; I’m<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1099" href="#">26</a> only keeping her quarters clean for her.’”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6383">Armand remembered the stories in circulation in the county<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1100" href="#">27</a>.
        Rumour had charged Walter Abelard with the responsibility for the death of his sister, partly on the ground of
        subsequent incidents, partly on the impossibility of an outside<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1101" href="#">28</a>
        assassin penetrating so far or, even supposing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1102" href="#">29</a> he entered,
        committing the deed and effecting his escape without leaving one trace behind.
        Why, there was the ivy.
        And even if the ivy were not so thick one hundred years ago, an agile man and a gymnast could easily ascend the
        porch to the arched orifices and descend again after his work had been done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6384">“You<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1103" href="#">30</a> are interested?” said
        Abelard, “well, we’ll go<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1104" href="#">31</a> at once and see the room.”
        And he rang for a servant to bring the key of the ominous chamber.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6385">Armand had by this time almost convinced himself that his nocturnal experience was
        only a peculiarly vivid and disagreeable dream.
        He followed Stephen with the expectation,— or was it not the hope?
        — of finding the room quite other than he had seen it in that uncomfortable experience.
        As Stephen<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1105" href="#">32</a> Abelard opened the door and light overcame its native
        dimness, the first thing Armand saw was a bare iron bed in the width of the outer wall, the next a faded
        armchair with tarnished cushions against </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 975</p>
<p class="PE">the inner masonry.
        The room was dim by reason of the thickness of the ivy choking its arched stone orifices.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6386">No dream then, but a reality!
        Someone had twice entered his room, once to open, once to shut the door of ill omen.
        Was it Mrs.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1106" href="#">33</a> Roberts, somnambulist, vaguely drawn to the door she
        alone was accustomed to unlock?
        But where at night could she get the key? for it was, Stephen had said, with Isabel Abelard.
        Again, it was as if a blow struck him.
        For, if the key was with Isabel, only Richard Lancaster could easily have got it from her at night, only he or
        she could have made that nocturnal entry.
        And it was Richard Lancaster he had seen under the balcony when he looked out into the moonlight.
        Was it the heir of the house who had entered, opened the door, gone out to look up at the room from outside and
        afterwards returned to shut it?
        But on what conceivable impulse?
        Was it the memory of a somnambulist returning to Armand’s question of the morning?
        That was a very likely explanation and fitted admirably with all the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1107" href="#">34</a> circumstances.
        Or was his action in any way linked to those nervous perturbations so new and out of place in this shallow,
        confident and ordinary nature?
        That was a circumstance into which the theory did not fit quite so easily<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1108" href="#">35</a>.
        A great uneasiness was growing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1109" href="#">36</a> on Armand Sieurcaye.
        In a supernatural mystery he did not believe, but he was too practised in life not to believe in natural human
        mysteries underlying the even surface of things.
        He knew that men of the most commonplace outside have often belied their appearance by their actions.
        A presentiment of dangerous and calamitous things was upon him, and he remembered that his presentiments had
        more often justified themselves than not.
        But to Stephen Abelard he said nothing; least of all did he say anything to Richard Abelard of that nocturnal
        outing which he had so glibly denied.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-door-at-abelard-ii">Chapter II</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6387"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 976</p>
<p class="PE">Another week had passed by, but Armand’s nerves were not reconciled to the door of ill omen that
        looked nightly at him with the secret of Bertha Abelard’s death behind it.
        Yet nothing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1110" href="#">37</a> farther had happened of an unusual nature.
        Richard Abelard was often absent and distracted, a thing formerly unknown in him, and his speech was
        occasionally irritable, but there was nothing out of the ordinary in his action.
        He walked, smoked, shot, rode, hunted, played billiards and read the light literature that pleased him, without
        any deviation from his familiar habits.
        Armand noticed that on some days he was entirely his old self, and then he invariably spoke with great
        satisfaction of the profound sleep he had enjoyed all night.
        Sieurcaye finally dismissed the presentiment from his mind.
        He had accepted the somnambulist theory; it was sleeplessness that was telling on Richard’s nerves.
        The whole mystery received a rational explanation on that simple hypothesis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6388">Two nights after he arrived at this cheerful conclusion, he woke at night for the
        first time after the experience of the open door.
        Every night he had thought of watching for the somnambulist, but, though<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1111" href="#">38</a> he had been accustomed all his life to light slumbers, a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1112" href="#">39</a> sleep as profound as that of which Richard Lancaster boasted, glued his head to the pillow.
        On this particular night his wife was not with him, for, to satisfy a caprice of Isabel’s, she was sleeping with
        her sister in their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1113" href="#">40</a> old nursery.
        Armand turned on his pillow, noticed with the surprise of a half-sleeping man the absence of his wife, then
        glanced about the room and observed that the door of his chamber was slightly open.
        A meaningless detail at first, the circumstance began to awaken a sort of indolent wonder
        — had Aloÿse come into the room to visit his sleep and gone back to the nursery?
        Or was it Richard the somnambulist driven by the monomania of the locked room?
        And then, as if galvanised by a shock of electricity, he sat up in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1114" href="#">41</a> bed, suddenly, violently, and stared at the door with unbelieving eyes.
        It had come back to him that, before turning into bed, on the spur of some unaccountable impulse, he had locked
        his </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 977</p>
<p class="PE">room and lain down wondering at his own purposeless action.
        And there now was the door he had thus secured, open, with the key in the lock, challenging him for an
        explanation.
        Had he got up himself in his sleep and opened it?
        Had he too grown a somnambulist?
        He remembered the profound slumber, so unusual to him, so similar to Lancaster’s, that had surprised him for the
        last few nights.
        Then an idea occurred to his rapidly working mind; he got out of bed, went to the inner door and turned the
        handle.
        It opened!
        He looked into the room with the iron bed.
        There was no one there, only the bed and the armchair.
        Then he closed the door, walked over to his own door, locked it, put the key under his pillow and got into bed
        again.
        His heart was beating a little faster than usual as he lay gazing at the door of Bertha Abelard’s death chamber.
        And then a very simple explanation flashed on him.
        Baulked by the locked door, Richard had climbed up by the ivy from outside and effected his entry from Bertha’s
        chamber.
        But Isabel was not with Richard tonight — how could he have got possession of the key?
        Well, conceivably, Isabel might have left her keys by oversight in her own chamber, or the somnambulist might
        have entered the nursery and detached what he needed from his wife’s chatelaine.
        But what settled waking idea, what persistent fancy of sleep drove Richard Lancaster to the ominous chamber,
        forced him to devise entrance against every obstacle and by such forbidden means?
        Armand shuddered as he remembered the story of Bertha Abelard’s death and his own theory of the means by which
        her assassin had gained entrance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6389">As he expected, he soon fell asleep.
        Rising the next morning, his first action was to walk over to the inner door and try it.
        It was locked!
        Well, that was natural.
        Somnambulists were often alert and keen-minded even beyond their waking selves and Richard, foiled again by the
        locked door, had climbed up once more by the ivy to efface all proof of his nocturnal visit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6390">Armand contrived that morning to be alone with Isabel in order to ask her where
        she kept the key of Bertha Abelard’s chamber.
        She turned to him with laughing eyes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6391">“You are not haunted, Armand?
        No?
        It’s always with me and the ghost, if she’s there, must get through solid wood to </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 978</p>
<p class="PE">invade your room.
        I keep my chatelaine at night under my pillow.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6392">“You had it there last night?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6393">“Armand!
        I am positive our ancestress has visited you.
        Yes, last night too.”
        And then suddenly, “Why, no, it was not.
        I put it last night in the box where I kept my doll and my toys.
        Don’t look<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1115" href="#">42</a> surprised, Armand.
        I’m a great baby still in many things and I wanted to have everything last night just as it was when we were
        children.
        I was a very careful and jealous little housewife, and before I slept I used always to lock up my chatelaine
        with my doll and playthings and treasure the tiny key of my box in a locket under my nightgown.
        I did all that last night.
        If you have been haunted, I’m not responsible.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6394">“Did you tell anybody what you were going to do?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6395">“I did not think of it till we went to bed.
        Only Aloÿse knew.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6396">“Does anybody else know of this habit of your childhood?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6397">“Only Roberts and papa.
        They don’t remember, probably.
        I had forgotten it myself till last night.
        What is puzzling you, Armand?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6398">“Oh, it is only an idea I had,” he replied, and rapidly escaped from farther<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1116" href="#">43</a> question to the sitting-room set apart for himself and Aloÿse.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6399">The thing was staggering.
        Somnambulism did not make one omniscient, and it was impossible that Richard Abelard should have known this
        arrangement of Isabel’s far-off childhood, extracted the key from his sleeping wife’s locket, the chatelaine
        from the box and restored them undiscovered, when his need was finished.
        The theory involved such a chain of impossibilities and improbabilities that it must be rejected.
        And then, as always, a solution suggested itself.
        Richard Abelard must have taken, long ago, the impress of the key and got a duplicate of it made for his own
        secret use.
        But if so, what unavowable<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1117" href="#">44</a> design, what stealthy manoeuvres must
        such a subterfuge be intended to serve?
        What legitimate need could Richard Abelard have of this secret and ominous exit or entry?
        Was it not Armand’s duty to warn Stephen Abelard of proceedings that must conceal in them something abnormal,
        perilous or even criminal?
        But there </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 979</p>
<p class="PE">was the danger that Isabel might come to hear of it and receive a shock.
        Armand decided to wait till after her delivery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6400">A knock at the door roused him from his thoughts and in response to his invitation
        Richard Abelard himself entered.
        He walked up to the fireplace, flung himself into a chair opposite Armand and jerked out abruptly:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6401">“Dr. Armand, you are a dab at medical diagnosis.
        Can’t you tell me what’s the matter with me?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6402">“Name your symptoms.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6403">“You’ve seen some of them yourself.
        I’ve observed you noticing me.
        But that’s nothing.
        It’s the mind.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6404">“What of the mind?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6405">“Oh, how should I know?
        Dreams, imaginations, sensations, impulses.
        Yes, impulses.”
        He grew pale as he repeated the word.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6406">“Can’t you be more precise?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6407">“I can’t; the thing’s vague.”
        He paused a moment; and then his features altered, a look of deep agony passed over them.
        “Somebody is hunting me,” he cried, “somebody’s hunting me.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6408">A great dread and sickness of heart<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1118" href="#">45</a> seized upon Armand Sieurcaye as he looked at his brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6409">“Steady!” he cried, “it’s a nervous disorder, of course, nothing more.
        But you are hiding something from me.
        That won’t do.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6410">“Nerves!
        Don’t tell me I’m going mad!
        Or if I am, prevent it, for Isabel’s sake.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6411">“Of course, I’ll prevent it.
        But you have got to be frank with me.
        I must know everything.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6412">A visible hesitation held Richard for a few seconds, then he said, “I’ve told all
        I can think of, all that’s definite.”
        Then, suddenly, striking the arm of his chair with his closed hand, “It’s this beastly house,” he cried;
        “there’s something in it!
        There’s something in it that ought not to be there.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6413">“If you think so, you must leave it till your nerves are restored.
        Look here, why not take John’s yacht and go for a cruise, oh, to America, if you like,— or to Japan.
        Japan will give you a longer spell of the sea.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6414"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 980</p>
<p class="PE">“I’ll do it,” cried Richard Lancaster, “as soon as Isabel’s safe through this, I’ll go.
        Thank you, Armand.”
        And with a look of great relief on his face, he rose and left the room.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6415">Armand had not much time to ponder over this singular interview, though certain
        phrases Richard had used, kept ringing in his brain; for that night the pangs of childbirth came upon Isabel and
        she was safely delivered of a male child.
        An heir was born to the dying house of Abelard.
        The strong health of Isabel Abelard easily shook from it the effects of the strain.
        There was no danger for her and the child seemed likely to inherit the robust physique of his parents.
        As for Richard, he was joyous, at ease and seemed to have put from him his idea of a flight from Abelard.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6416">But on the third night after the delivery Armand Sieurcaye had troubled dreams and
        wandered through strange afflictions; the rustling of a dress haunted him; a pang of terror, a movement of agony
        seemed to come from someone’s heart into his own, and there was a laughter in the air he did not love.
        And in the grey of the autumn morning, Stephen Abelard with a strange look in his eyes stood by his side.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6417">“Get up, Armand; dress and come.
        Do not disturb Aloÿse.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6418">In three minutes Armand was outside on the landing where Stephen Abelard was
        pacing to and fro under the whip of the sorrow that had leaped<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1119" href="#">46</a>
        upon him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6419">“Isabel is dead,” he said briefly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6420">With a dull brain that refused to think Armand followed the father to the death
        chamber of his child.
        The wall lamp was flaring high above the bed.
        A night-lamp that no one had thought to put out, burned on the toilette-table.
        In a chair far from the bed Richard Lancaster with his face hidden in his hands sat rocking himself, his body
        shaken by sobs.
        When Armand entered, he uncovered his face, cast at him a tragic look from eyes full of tears, and went swaying
        from the room.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6421">Armand stood at the bedside and looked at the dead girl.
        As he looked, a pang of fear troubled his heart, for his practised perceptions, familiar with many kinds of
        death, gave him an appalling intimation.
        Isabel had not died easily!
        Then something </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 981</p>
<p class="PE">peculiar in the pose of the head and neck struck his awakened brain.
        He bent down suddenly, then rose<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1120" href="#">47</a> as suddenly, his olive face
        sallow<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1121" href="#">48</a> with some strong emotion, strode to the toilette-table,
        seized the night-lamp and returning held it to Isabel’s neck.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6422">“What is it?” asked Stephen Abelard.
        One could see that he was holding himself tight to meet a possible shock.
        Armand carefully put back the lamp where it had stood and returned to the bedside before he answered.
        In the shock of his discovery he had forgotten his surroundings, forgotten to whom he was about to speak.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6423">“It is a murder,” he said, slowly and mechanically.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6424">“Armand!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6425">“It is a murder,” he continued, unheeding the cry of the father, “I cannot be
        mistaken.
        And effected by unusual means.
        There is a spot in the body which has only to be found by the fingers and receive a peculiar pressure and a man
        dies suddenly, surely, with so light a trace only the eyes of the initiate can discover it
        — not even a trace, only an indication, but a sure indication.
        The Japanese wrestlers know the device, but do not impart it except to those who are too self-disciplined to
        abuse it.
        That is what has been done here.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6426">Stephen Abelard seized Armand’s shoulder with a tense, violent grip.
        “Armand,” he cried, “who besides yourself knows of this means of murder?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6427">“John Lancaster knows it.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6428">Stephen’s hand fell limply<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1122" href="#">49</a> from
        his son-in-law’s shoulder.
        After a time he said in a voice that was again calm, “Armand, my child died of heart-failure as so many of the
        Abelards have done.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6429">“It is best so,” replied Armand Sieurcaye.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6430">“Now go, Armand,” continued Stephen quietly, “go and leave me alone with my
        child.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6431">Armand did not return to his chamber, but went into his sitting-room, lighted a
        candle and sat, looking at the chair in which Richard Abelard had consulted him only three days ago.
        John Lancaster, Richard’s brother, who alone near Orringham knew of the Japanese secret!
        What share had John Lancaster, </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 982</p>
<p class="PE">friend of Armand Sieurcaye, in the murder of Isabel Abelard?
        Was it for his entry that Richard had provided, by the duplicate key, by his strange and perilous manoeuvres
        with the ivy and the balcony room?
        But why not open the front door for him or leave unshuttered one of the lower windows, a much easier and less
        dangerous passage?
        Then he remembered that the great dog, Brilliant, lay at the bottom of the stairs and would not allow any but an
        inmate to pass unchallenged.
        John Lancaster was his friend, his benefactor, but Armand knew the man, a reckless flamboyant profligate capable
        of the most glorious and self-immolating actions and capable equally of the most cruel and cynical crimes.
        He remembered, too, how he himself had taught John that peculiar trick of the Japanese art of slaying.
        In a certain sense he himself was responsible for Isabel’s death.
        How wise were the Easterns<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1123" href="#">50</a> in their rigid reticence when they
        taught only to prepared and disciplined natures the secrets that might be misused to harm mankind!
        And then his mind travelled to Isabel and her sorrowful end slain in the supreme moment of a woman’s joy by the
        husband she loved.
        What grim and inexorable Power ruling the world, Fate, Chance, Providence, had singled out for this doom a girl
        whose whole life had been an innocent shedding of sunshine on all who came near?
        Providence!
        He smiled.
        There were still fools who believed in an overruling Providence, a wise and compassionate God!
        And then the insoluble problem returned to baffle his mind, what possible motive moved Richard to compass this
        heartless crime or John to assist him?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6432">All that day of sorrow Richard was absent from the house, and Armand had no chance
        of probing him.
        It was late at night, about eleven, that he entered.
        Armand met him on his way to his room, candle in hand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6433">“I should<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1124" href="#">51</a> like a word with you,
        Richard,” he said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6434">Richard turned on him, laughing with a terrible gaiety.
        “No use, Doctor Armand.
        You could not save me, you see.
        The thing was too strong.
        Mark my words, the thing will be too strong even for you.”
        And he strode to his room leaving Armand amazed on the staircase.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6435"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 983</p>
<p class="PE">Aloÿse had elected to sleep that night with her dead sister’s child and Armand once more found himself
        alone in Bertha Abelard’s chamber with no companion except the locked door, accomplice perhaps in the tragedy
        that had darkened the house.
        Again his slumbers were troubled and he dreamed always of the locked door open and someone traversing the room
        on a mission of evil, a work of horror.
        He woke with a start, his heart in him dull and heavy as lead and full of the conviction, which it called
        knowledge, that the tragedy was not finished but more crimes mysterious and unnatural were about to pollute the
        old walls of Abelard.
        Then his thoughts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1125" href="#">52</a> flew to Aloÿse.
        He dressed himself hastily and went to the room where she was sleeping.
        Aloÿse was asleep and the child’s nurse slept on a bed some five feet away, but Armand cast only a fleeting
        glance at the two women, for between the beds was the cradle of Isabel’s child and over it was a figure
        stooping, and as it lifted its face towards the opened door, he saw a face that was and yet was not the face of
        Richard Lancaster.
        Richard immediately moved over to the door.
        As he neared<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1126" href="#">53</a>, Armand drew away from it with the first pang of
        absolute terror in his heart he had ever experienced since his childhood.
        Richard Lancaster noted the emotion and it seemed to amuse him, for he laughed.
        And again there was something in the laugh that was not in the laugh of Richard Lancaster or of any human mirth
        to which Armand Sieurcaye had ever listened.
        As soon as Richard had left the room, Armand almost ran to the door, locked it and sat down at his wife’s
        bedside shaking with an excitement he could not control.
        He soon recovered hold of his nerves, but he did not leave the room and its unconscious inmates.
        He sat there motionless till at four o’clock in the morning a light knock at the door startled him.
        When he opened it, Stephen Abelard entered.
        He took Armand’s presence as a matter of course and went calmly to the side of the child and began looking down
        on the heir of his house, the little baby who was<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1127" href="#">54</a> all that was
        left to him of Isabel.
        When he turned from the cradle, Armand spoke.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6436">“Sir, you must do something about Richard.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6437">Stephen looked at him.
        “Come to my room, Armand,” he </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 984</p>
<p class="PE">said, “We will talk there.”
        Before following Stephen, Armand woke the nurse and bade her watch over the child.
        “Lock the door,” he added, “and keep it locked till I return.”
        As he went through the corridors, he passed Richard’s room.
        The door was open, but the room absolutely dark; still his practised eyes perceived in the doorway a figure
        standing which drew back when he looked at it, obviously not the figure of Richard, for it was shorter,
        slenderer.
        When he was entering Stephen’s room, it occurred to him that he had unconsciously carried away in his mind the
        impression that it was the figure of a woman.
        After the first disagreeable feeling had passed, he shook the absurdity from him; it must have been the
        dressing-gown that gave him the idea of a woman’s robe.
        After a brief talk with Stephen, the two were pulling in silence at the cigars they had lighted, when, perhaps
        half an hour after his leaving the nursery, someone knocked at the door and the nurse appeared and beckoned to
        Armand Sieurcaye.
        There was a look of terrible anxiety on her face that brought Armand striding to the door.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6438">“Will you come, sir?” she said, “I don’t know what’s the matter with the child.”
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6439">“Did you lock the door?” asked Armand, as they went.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6440">The nurse looked troubled.
        “I thought I did, though I could not understand why you wanted it; but it seems I can’t have turned the key
        well.
        For when I dozed off for two minutes, I woke to find the door open.”
        Then she paused and added with great hesitation.
        “And I almost<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1128" href="#">55</a> felt, sir, as if I had noticed a woman in the room
        standing by the cradle<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1129" href="#">56</a>, but I was too sleepy to understand.
        It wasn’t Mrs. Sieurcaye, for I had to wake her up afterwards.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6441">A woman!
        And the locked door that opened!
        Armand groaned; he could understand nothing, but he knew what he would find even before he bent with the already
        awakened and anxious Aloÿse over the dead child who had thus so swiftly followed his mother to the grave.
        And it was by the same way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6442">That morning Stephen Abelard spoke to his elder son-in-law.
        “Richard,” he said, “you will start for your sea-voyage today.
        Take John’s yacht at Bristol.
        You need not wait for the </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 985</p>
<p class="PE">funeral nor mind what people will say.
        If I were you, I’ld have a doctor on board.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6443">Richard Lancaster was very calm and deliberate as he replied, “I had settled that,
        sir, before you spoke.
        I’m going on a long journey and I’m going direct, not by Bristol nor in the yacht.
        As you suggest, I’ll not wait for the funeral and I’m past caring what people will say.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6444">“Don’t forget the doctor,” insisted Stephen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6445">“The doctor can’t come,” said Richard, “And he wouldn’t<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1130" href="#">57</a> like the voyage.
        I’m not mad, sir,— worse luck!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6446">The two sons-in-law of Stephen Abelard left the house-steps together, Armand for a
        stroll in the grounds to steady his heated brain and his shaken nerves, Richard in the direction of the stables.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6447">When Armand was returning to the house, a pale-faced groom ran up to him and
        pointed in the direction of the great avenue of stately trees before Abelard.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6448">“Mr. Richard’s lying there,” he faltered, “— shot!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6449">Armand stood stock-still for a moment, then ran to the spot indicated.
        Of this last tragedy he had had no presentiment.
        What was it?
        What was this maddening and bloody tangle?
        This death dance of an incomprehensible fate which had struck down mother, father and child in less than thirty
        hours?
        No gleam of motive, no shred of coherence illuminated the nightmare.
        His reason stood helpless at last in the maze.
        It was the locked door, he thought, that opened and revealed nothing.
        But his reason insisted.
        Richard Abelard was mad, and in his madness he had used the device John must have incautiously taught him to
        slay wife and child; and this last act of self-slaughter was the natural refuge of a disturbed brain made aware
        by Armand’s looks and by Stephen’s words of discovery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6450">Richard Abelard lay dead on the grass by the avenue, shot through the heart and
        the revolver lay fallen two feet from his outstretched and nerveless hand.
        Armand, bending to assure himself that life was extinct, caught sight of a small piece of paper lying close to
        the knee of the dead man.
        When he rose, he turned to the groom.
        “Mr. Richard’s dead,” he said, “go and tell </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 986</p>
<p class="PE">Mr. Abelard and bring men here to carry him in.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6451">The man reluctantly departed and Armand caught up the paper and put it swiftly
        into his pocket.
        It was not till an hour later that he had time to take it out in his parlour and look at it.
        As he had suspected, it was a brief note in Richard’s handwriting, and thus it ran, brief, pointed, tragic,
        menacing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6452">“Armand, you knew!
        But it was not I.
        God is my Witness, I am not guilty of murder.
        I can say no more; but in mercy to Aloÿse, look to yourself!”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6453">For a long time Armand Sieurcaye held in his hand the dead man’s mysterious
        warning.
        Then he flung it into the fire and watched its whiteness blacken, shrivel and turn into ashes.</p>

        against the teeth.
        The sobriety of history merely records that her face was twin sister to a ferret, her features sharp and if the
        word may be used without offence gritty: altogether she was an excellent type of that class of crude failures

        In the sky a bright moon pursued by clouds ran timidly up the ascent of the firmament; great arms of darkness
        sometimes closed over it; sometimes it emerged and proceeded with its still luminous race, ran, swayed, floated,

        of Colonel Luke Walter.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6480">The young Cavalier started and uttered a furious imprecation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6481">“It was he;” said the other, “he has great brain-power and penetration and a
        resolute genius.
        It is even possible he may succeed Cromwell, if the God of the Puritans gives him a lease long enough.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6482">“If I have the chance, I will shorten it,” cried Patrick Curran.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6483"></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 993</p>
<p class="PE">“Or I;” said the unknown, “for just now I too am a Royalist.
        But to proceed.
        You were proclaimed and doomed to a felon’s death in your absence; the Earl, implicated in the conspiracy, was
        compelled as the price of his pardon to betroth his daughter to Luke Walter, and the marriage is fixed for
        tonight.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6484">“Tonight!” groaned the young man, and he smote his thigh miserably with his hand.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6485">“At the Church of Worndale.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6486">“But will it matter if Luke Walter perishes before he has consummated his
        nuptials?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6487">“I promise you that,” said the unknown.
        “It does not suit you that Alicia should marry another.
        It does not suit me that there should be a strong successor to Cromwell.
        Charles Stuart is my good friend, and I wish that he should rule England.
        Therefore, Patrick, it is a bargain.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6488">“Who the devil are you?” cried the young man again, marvelling.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6489">As if to answer the moon peeped out from between two heavy angry masses of black
        cloud, illumining the earth’s intense and inclement whiteness.
        He saw beside him a young man of remarkable beauty, whose face was perfectly familiar, but his name could not be
        remembered.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6490">“As for your soul and your life,” said the stranger, and as their eyes met,
        Patrick shuddered, “you need not give them to the devil whether freely or as part of the bargain, for they are
        already his.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6491">He laughed a laugh of terrible and ominous sweetness, and in a moment Patrick
        remembered.
        He knew that laugh, he knew that face.
        They were his own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6492">At that moment the moon passed away into the second fragment of cloud.
        Patrick stood, unable to speak, looking at the dim shadow in front of him.
        Then it vanished.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6493">It was some time before the young man could command himself sufficiently to pursue
        his way.
        He tried to think for a moment that it was John Dacre, the illegitimate son of Sir Gerald by his sister-in-law
        Matilda Dacre, who resembled Patrick strongly and was his sworn comrade and lover.
        But he knew </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 994</p>
<p class="PE">it was not John.
        That was not John’s face or John’s speech or John’s thinking.
        It must have been a vivid dream or a waking illusion.
        He walked forward in the darkness, greatly disturbed, but with recovered courage.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6494">Again the moon shone out, this time with a clear gulf of sky just in front of her.
        Before Patrick the white road stretched long, straight and visible to a great distance and was marked out here
        by a high<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1133" href="#">3</a> snow-covered hedge from the equally white
        indistinguishable country around.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6495">“Come now, that is better,” said Patrick Curran.
        As he spoke, he saw far off on the road a dark object travelling towards him; he slackened his pace and was
        minded to turn off the road to avoid it.
        But it was approaching with phenomenal speed.
        As it came nearer, he saw that it was only a dog.
        Again Patrick stood still.
        A dog!
        There was nothing in that.
        It was not what he had feared.
        But he remembered that singular conversation and the impious prayer that had arisen in his heart about the brown
        Dog of the Dacres,— the dog which showed itself always when a Dacre was about to die and leaped on him whenever
        the doom was by violence.
        He smiled, but a little uncertainly.
        Then the moonlight seemed to dwell on the swiftly-travelling animal more intensely and he saw that it was brown.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6496">Never had Patrick seen any earthly thing master of such a terrible speed.
        It ran, it galloped, it bounded, and the wretched man watching the terrific charge of that phantasmal monster,—
        for it was a gigantic mastiff,— felt his heart stop and his warm youthful blood congeal in his veins.
        It was now within twenty paces; he felt the huge eyes upon him and knew that it was going to leap.
        He went down heavily with the ponderous frame of the animal oppressing his breast, its leonine paws on his
        shoulders, its hot breathing moistening his face.
        And then there was nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6497">That was the most terrible part of it, to have been borne down physically by a
        semblance, an unearthly hallucination, a thing that was this moment and the next was not.
        Patrick struggled to his feet, overcome by a panic terror; his nerves cried to him to run, to travel away
        quickly from this accursed night </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 995</p>
<p class="PE">and this road of ghastly encounters.
        But he felt as if hamstrung, helpless, clutched by an intangible destruction.
        He sat down on the snow, panted and waited.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6498">After a few minutes the blood began to flow more quietly through his veins, the
        pounding of his heart slackened and the sick agitation of his nerves yielded to a sudden fiery inrush.
        He leaped furiously to his feet.
        “The Dog of the Dacres,” he cried, “the brown Dog, the Devil’s Mastiff!
        And no doubt it was his master spoke to me in my own semblance.
        I am doomed, then.
        But not to the gallows.
        No, by God, not to the gallows.
        God’s doom and the devil’s, since I can resist neither, but not man’s, not Cromwell’s!”
        Then he paused.
        “Tonight!” he cried again.
        “At Worndale Church!
        But I will see her once before I go down to Hell.
        And it may be I shall take Luke Walter with me.
        It may be that is what the Devil wants of me.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6499">He looked about the landscape and thought he could distinguish the trees that
        bordered the distant Church of Worndale.
        That was in front of him.
        Also in front, but much more to the left, was Trevesham Hall, the home of Alicia Nevil.
        He began walking rapidly, no longer with his first cautious and doubtful treading, but with a bold reckless
        stride.
        And it was noticeable that he no longer stumbled or floundered into snowdrifts.
        Patrick knew that he had only a few brief inches of his life’s road left to his treading; for no man of the
        Dacre blood had ever lived more than twenty-four hours after the Brown Dog leaped on him.
        A desperate courage had entered into his veins.
        He would see</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6501"><b><span class="bukvica">I</span>t was</b> in the forests of Asan that the Golden
        Bird first flew out from a flower-besieged thicket and fluttered before the dazzled eyes of Luilla.
        It was in the forests of Asan,— the open and impenetrable, the haunt of the dancers and the untrodden<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1134" href="#">1</a> of human feet, coiling place of the cobra and the Python, lair
        of the lion and the jaguar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1135" href="#">2</a>, formidable retreat of the fleeing
        antelope, yet also the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1136" href="#">3</a> green home of human safety where a man and
        a maiden could walk in the moonlit night and hear unconcerned the far-off brool<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1137" href="#">4</a> of the kings of the wilderness.
        It was into the friendly and open places that the golden bird fluttered, but it came no less from the coverts of
        dread and mystery.
        From the death and the night it flew out into the sunlight where Luilla was happily straying.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6502">Luilla loved to wander on the verges of danger just where those flower-besieged
        thickets began and formed for miles together a thorny and tangled rampart full at once of allurement and of
        menace<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1138" href="#">5</a>.
        She did not venture in, for she had a great fear of the thorns and brambles and a high respect for her radiant
        beauty, her constant<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1139" href="#">6</a> object of worship and the daily delight of
        all who dwelt<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1140" href="#">7</a> for a while on earth labouring the easy and kindly
        soil on the verges of the forests of Asan.
        But always she wandered close to the flowery wall and her mind, safe in its volatile<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1141" href="#">8</a> incorporeality, strayed like a many-hued butterfly far into the forbidden
        region which the gods had so carefully secluded.
        Perhaps secretly she hoped that one<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1142" href="#">9</a> day some kingly and leonine
        head would thrust itself out through the flowers and compel her with a gaze of friendly and majestic invitation
        or else that the green poisonous head of a serpent, reposing itself on a flower, would scrutinise her out of
        narrow eyes and express a cunning approval of her beauty.
        It was not out of fear of the lions and the serpents that Luilla forbore to enter the secret places.
        She </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 997</p>
<p class="PE">knew she could overcome the most ferocious intentions of any destroyer in the world, four-footed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1143" href="#">10</a> or footless, if only he would give her three minutes before
        making up his mind to eat or bite her.
        But neither lion nor serpent strayed out of their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1144" href="#">11</a> appointed
        haunts.
        It was the golden bird that first fluttered out from the thickets to Luilla.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6503">Luilla looked at it as it flitted from bough to bough, and her eyes were dazzled
        and her soul wondered.
        For the little body of the bird was an inconstant flame of flying and fleeting gold and the wings that opened
        and fluttered were of living gold and the small shapely head was crested gold and the long graceful quivering
        tail was feathered trailing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1145" href="#">12</a> gold; all was gold about the bird,
        except the eyes and they were two jewels of a soft everchanging colour and sheltered strange looming<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1146" href="#">13</a> depths of love and thought in their gentle brilliance.
        On the bough where it perched, it seemed as if all the soft shaded leaves were suddenly sunlit.
        For as Luilla accustomed her eyes to the flickering brightness of the golden bird, it hovered at last over<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1147" href="#">14</a> a branch, settled and sang.
        And its voice also was of gold.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6504">The bird sang in its own high secret language; but Luilla’s ear understood its
        thoughts and in Luilla’s soul as it thirsted and listened and trembled with delight, the song shaped itself
        easily into human speech.
        This then was what the bird sang — the bird that came out of the death and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1148" href="#">15</a> night, sang to Luilla a song of beauty and of delight.</p>

        greener are the impenetrable thickets of Asan than her open places of life and more beautiful than the meadows
        and the pastures and the cornfields are the forests of death and night.
        More ensnaring to some is the danger of the jaguar than the attractive face of a child, more welcome the
        foot-tracks of the lion as it hunts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1151" href="#">18</a> than the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1152" href="#">19</a> pastures of the cattle, more fair and fruitful the thorn and the wild-briar

<b>COLLECTED PLAYS AND STORIES</b> comprises all of Sri Aurobindo's dramatic and fictional writings, with the
        exception of prose dialogues, verse dialogues more in the nature of poems than plays, and translations from
        Sanskrit drama. Writings in these three categories are published in <em>Early Cultural Writings</em>,
        <em>Collected Poems</em>, and <em>Translations</em>, volumes 1, 2 and 5 of THE COMPLETE WORKS OF SRI AUROBINDO.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6509">
<em>Collected Plays and Stories</em> is divided into three parts according to type of material. The first part
        includes the five complete plays; the second, incomplete and fragmentary plays; the third, prose fiction,
        complete, incomplete and fragmentary. The first two parts are arranged chronologically, from earliest to latest.
        The third is subdivided into two sections: <em>Occult Idylls</em>, a series planned by the author, followed by a
        section consisting of all other pieces of fiction, arranged chronologically.
    </p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="complete-plays">Complete Plays</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6510">The first of these plays was written around 1905, the last in 1915. Only one of
        them, <em>Perseus the Deliverer</em>, was published during Sri Aurobindo's lifetime.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6511"><b>The Viziers of Bassora</b>. The manuscript of this
        play was seized by the police at the time of Sri Aurobindo’s arrest in
        connection with the Alipore Bomb Case in May 1908. It seems to have been written
        a few years before that, towards the end of the period of his employment in the
        Baroda State (1893 – 1906).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6512">

        Sri Aurobindo never saw the manuscript of <em>The Viziers </em>after his
        arrest, and he is said to have particularly regretted its loss. Once in
        Pondicherry he tried to reconstruct one of the missing scenes using a
        partial draft he had with him, but soon abandoned the effort. In March
        1952, fifteen months after his passing, the manuscript was handed over

    </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 1002</p>
<p class="PE">

        to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram by the Government of West Bengal. It was transcribed and in 1959 published in the
        <em>Sri Aurobindo Mandir</em> <em>Annual</em>, as well as separately.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6513">

        The source of the plot of <em>The Viziers of Bassora </em>is "Nur al-Din Ali and the Damsel Anis al-Jalis", a
        story told in the <em>Arabian Nights</em> (thirty-fourth to thirty-eighth nights). Sri Aurobindo owned in Baroda
        a multi-volume edition of Richard Burton's translation of the Arabic text (London, 1894), which he considered
        "as much a classic as the original".

    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6514"><b>Rodogune</b>. Two complete, independent versions of
        this play exist. Sri Aurobindo wrote the first one in Baroda between 31 January
        and 14 February 1906, on the eve of his departure from the state to join the
        national movement. In May 1908 the notebooks containing his fair copy of <em>
            Rodogune</em>, like the notebook containing <em>The Viziers of Bassora</em>, were
        seized by the police when Sri Aurobindo was arrested. Fortunately, other
        notebooks remaining in his possession contained much of the penultimate draft of
        the 1906 version. Basing himself on these passages, he was able to reconstruct
        the play in Pondicherry around 1912. This version was published in the <em>Sri
            Aurobindo Mandir Annual</em> and separately in 1958. It supersedes the Baroda
        version, which was recovered in 1952.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6515">

        The plot of <em>Rodogune </em>derives ultimately from the history of Cleopatra, Queen of Syria, as recounted by
        such classical historians as Appian, Justin and Josephus. The immediate source probably was <em>Rodogune
        </em>(1645), by the French dramatist Pierre Corneille.

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6516">
<b>Perseus the Deliverer. </b>Sri Aurobindo wrote this play during the period of his political activity, and its
        publication history is marked by the uncertainties of that era. A notation from the now-lost manuscript,
        accidentally set in type, gives 21 June 1906 as the date of the writing or copying of Act III, Scene 1. Sri
        Aurobindo seems to have intended the play to be published in Baroda, and parts of it were composed there by
        August of the same year. This plan fell through, however, and the play did not appear until 1907, when it was
        brought out serially between 30 June and 20 October in the weekly edition of the <em>Bande</em>
<em>Mataram</em>, a journal of political opinion edited by Sri Aurobindo. The next year a book-edition was
        printed, but was destroyed by the printer
    </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 1003</p>
<p class="PE">at the time of Sri
        Aurobindo’s arrest. In 1942 the <em>Bande Mataram</em> text of <em>Perseus the
            Deliverer</em> – with the exception of three passages published in issues of the
        journal that were not then available, namely, all of Act II, Scenes 2 and 3, and
        the end of Act V, Scene 3 – was included in Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Collected Poems
            and Plays</em>. Sri Aurobindo revised this text, adding a new ending but ignoring
        the missing scenes of Act II. (The issues of <em>Bande Mataram</em> containing
        these two scenes were subsequently rediscovered, and in 1955 they were restored
        to the text.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6517">The plot of <em>Perseus the Deliverer</em> derives of
        course from the Greek legend of Perseus and Andromeda, the most important
        surviving classical source of which is the fourth book of Ovid’s <em>
            Metamorphoses</em>. Notable among modern retellings of the story are Corneille’s <em>
            Andromède</em> (1650) and Charles Kingsley’s <em>Andromeda</em> (1859), a poem in
        English hexameters with which Sri Aurobindo was familiar.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6518"><b>Eric</b>. Sri Aurobindo began work on this play in
        1910, shortly after his arrival in Pondicherry, and continued intermittently
        over a period of several years. No complete fair copy of the play survives. The
        fullest manuscript, a typed copy that contains the last version of Act II,
        breaks off in the middle of Act IV, Scene 2. Handwritten versions subsequent to
        the typed copy exist for Acts I and III and part of Act IV. There is only a
        single draft of Act V. Its interlinear and marginal revisions present unusual
        textual difficulties.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6519">
<em>Eric </em>was first published in 1960 in <em>Sri Aurobindo Mandir Annual</em> and as a separate book. The
        present text is thoroughly re-edited. As a rule, the last version of each act has been transcribed as far as it
        goes; where the last version is incomplete, the previous version is used for the remainder of the act. The order
        in which the last two manuscripts of Acts I and III were written and revised is not entirely clear. The unused
        versions of these two acts are reproduced in the reference volume (volume 35), along with two partial rewritings
        of Act IV, Scene 1, which could not be worked into the text of the play.

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6520">


        No specific source of the plot of <em>Eric </em>is known. Sri Aurobindo seems to have made free use of names and
        events from the history of Norway in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, a period that was the subject
        of much mediaeval Scandinavian literature.</p>

<p class="PE"><b>Vasavadutta</b>.
        This play was written in Pondicherry in 1915. The earliest extant draft is dated
        thus at the end: “Copied Nov. 2, 1915. Written between 18th &amp; 30th October 1915.
        Completed 30th October. Pondicherry. Revised in April 1916.” The fair copy, used
        as the text from Act III, Scene 4, to the end, gives details of this revision:
        “Revised and recopied between April 8th and April 17th 1916.” Subsequently, on
        three or four different occasions, Sri Aurobindo began to rewrite the play,
        stopping at an earlier point each time. The editors have used the last version
        of a given passage as far as it goes and then reverted to the previous version.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6521">


        A typed copy of <em>Vasavadutta </em>was prepared for Sri Aurobindo sometime in the late 1930s or early 1940s,
        and he made a few scattered revisions to it. When its publication was proposed, he demurred, saying it was "too
        romantic". The play did not appear in print until 1957, when it was published in the <em>Sri Aurobindo Mandir
            Annual </em>and as a separate book.
    </p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6522">As stated by Sri Aurobindo in his author’s note, he
        took the plot of <em>Vasavadutta</em> from the <em>Kathasaritsagara</em>, an
        eleventh-century Sanskrit story-cycle written by Somadeva Bhatta.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6524">The source of the plot of <em>The Witch of Ilni</em> is

        The plot of <em>The Prince of Edur </em>is based loosely on the life of Bappa
        Rawal, the eighth-century Rajput hero. The scene, which includes parts
        of what is now eastern Gujarat, was familiar to Sri Aurobindo, who
        was posted in the area while serving as a Baroda state officer.

<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6531"><b>The Birth of Sin</b>. This fragment, written in the

            of Sin</em>, was published in the <em>Karmayogin</em>, a weekly newspaper edited by
        Sri Aurobindo. The <em>Karmayogin</em> piece is more in the nature of a poem, and
        was published as such in <em>Collected Poems and Plays</em> (1942). (It is
        included in <em>Collected Poems</em>, volume 2 of <b>The Complete Works of Sri
            Aurobindo</b>.) The present draft is structured more as a drama, and is
        published as such here. The exact relationship between the two texts is not
        clear. Both obviously owe much to Milton.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CPS-6532"><b>Fragment of a Play</b>. This piece was written in
