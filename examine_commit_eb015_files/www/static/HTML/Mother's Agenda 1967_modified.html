<h2>Mother‚Äôs Agenda</h2>
<h3>1967</h3>
<p class="Pi" style="text-align:justify">
This tremendous document ‚Äî 6,000 pages in 13 volumes ‚Äî is the day-to-day account over twenty-two years of Mother's exploration in the body consciousness and of her discovery of a "cellular mind" capable of refashioning the nature of our bodies and the laws of the species as drastically as one day an infant "thinking mind" transformed the nature of the ape. It is a veritable document of experimental evolution. A revolution in consciousness that alters the laws of the species. And this is the very question of our times, for whatever the appearances, we are not at the end of a civilization but at the end of an evolutionary cycle. Are we going to find the passage to the next species... or perish? As scrupulously as a scientist in his laboratory, Mother goes back to the origin of Matter's formation, to the primordial code, and there, "by chance," stumbles upon the mechanism of death ‚Äî upon the very power that changes death ‚Äî and upon a "new" Energy, which curiously parallels the most recent theories on Matter's subatomic structure. The key to Matter contains the key to death... and the key to the next species.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-12">...In the afternoon, the lists [of appointments] have lengthened to such a point that I have no time left. Earlier, I would start my daily work (the mail to be signed and so on) at three-thirty, then it became four o'clock, and now it's a quarter to five. There was a time when I would have finished by four, so I worked on the translation of <em>Savitri</em> (that was long, long ago); later on, I finished at four-thirty, then I would still have time to take something, to eat a little; now I finish after five, so (<em>laughing</em>) that settles it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-13">It MUST be like that since it is like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-14">It's perhaps a lesson (it's an indication), but there is a purpose to it.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="4" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-15">It's the lesson that I have to understand, that I am trying to understand. I am learning to be very patient....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-16"><em>Yes!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-17">Oh, a patience ... People constantly bring revolt, abuse, all that. To me it's an absolute zero, and sometimes it's even amusing; sometimes I find it funny. But when I find it funny is not when I am in my best state, because when I am in my own state ‚Äî the true state of compassion ‚Äî it doesn't change anything, it doesn't even make a ripple on the surface, nothing. When it's funny is when it makes me start working on people who have done one thing or another. When something is at work, then I find it amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-18">Yesterday, I was asked the question; I was asked whether abuse, the feeling of being abused, and what in English is called <em>self-respect</em> (which is somewhat akin to self-esteem), have a place in the sadhana. Naturally, they don't, that goes without saying! But I saw the movement, it was extremely clear: I saw that without ego, when the ego</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 17</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-19"> isn't there, there CANNOT be that sort of ruffling in the being. I went back far into the past, to the time when I could still feel it (years ago), but now it's not even something unfamiliar ‚Äî it's something which is impossible. The whole being, and strangely even the physical constitution, doesn't understand what it means. It's the same thing when materially there is a knock (<em>Mother shows a scratch on her elbow</em>), like this for instance: it's no longer felt the way an injury is felt. It's no longer felt that way. More often than not, there's nothing at all, it goes absolutely unnoticed on the whole; but when there is something, it's only an impression ‚Äî a very ... sweet, very intimate impression ‚Äî of a help trying to make itself felt, of a lesson to be learned. But not the way it's done mentally where there is always a stiffening; it's not that: it's immediately a kind of offering in the being, which gives itself in order to learn. I am speaking of all the cells. It's very interesting. Of course, if we mentalize it, we have to say it's the sense or awareness of the divine Presence in all things, and that the mode ‚Äî the mode of contact ‚Äî comes from the state in which we are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-20">This is the body's experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-21">And the only perception when there is some <em>clash</em> or other in individuals, some shock or other, is always a clear vision of the ego ‚Äî the ego manifesting itself. They say, "It's the other's fault." I wouldn't say, "Oh, so-and-so was angry" or "Oh, so-and-so ..." No, it's his ego; not even his ego: THE EGO, the ego principle ‚Äî the ego principle intervening again. That's very interesting, because for me the ego has become a sort of impersonal entity, while for everyone, it's the acute sense of his personality! Instead of that, it's a sort of way of being (which we may call terrestrial, or human), a sort of way of being in greater or lesser quantity here or there or there, and which gives each one the illusion of his personality. It's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-22"><em>Yes, but the trouble is, others don't learn their lesson, so ... So they intrude upon you.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-23">Oh, if they learned their lesson, everything would change very quickly!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-24"><em>With the result that you are invaded, swamped.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-25">Can't be!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-26"><em>All your time is swallowed up, all your...</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 18</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-27">I can't be swallowed up! (<em>laughing</em>) I'm too big!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-28"><em>But even so, materially you're overburdened.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-29">I have noticed that if I resist, things go badly. If I have a sense of fluidity, there aren't anymore clashes. It's the same thing as with this scratch (<em>Mother shows her elbow</em>). You see, if you stiffen up and things resist, you knock yourself. It's like people who know how to fall: they fall without breaking anything. With people who don't know how to fall, the slightest tumble and they break something. It's the same thing. We must learn to be ... perfect oneness. To correct, to straighten things out, is still to resist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-30">So what's going to happen [if the invasion goes on]?... It will be amusing, we'll see! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) Since the others aren't in the same state, maybe they'll feel vexed, but I can't help it! (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-31">We should always laugh, always. The Lord laughs. He laughs, and His laughter is so good, so good, so full of love! A laughter that envelops you in an extraordinary sweetness.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>After the work, at the end of the interview, Mother suddenly seems to recollect something.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-48">Two nights ago, I was complaining that my nights were always spent in an obscure toil in the subconscient and that, after all ... (<em>laughing</em>) it was "not very amusing"! That's how it was, a whim. I was saying, "I would really like to have at night the full consciousness that I have when I am awake. There is something missing and what's missing is..." And I was trying to define that "something" which was the precise expression of what the physical creation has contributed to the immense Manifestation, and which is specific to the physical consciousness as nowhere else, in no other domain. So</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 20</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-49"> this was the problem: If it (<em>this "something" contributed by the physical consciousness</em>) can't be had in sleep, it means that when we lose our body, we'll lose a degree of precision, doesn't it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-50">Before going to sleep I was in that frame of mind, and during the night there was a series of experiences to show all the different states of consciousness of the different states of being. When I got up in the morning, there was a very keen observation of the difference contributed by the physical. I saw how that difference could persist in the new physical state once it had shed its false side. And then, for ... I don't know, certainly two hours, there was a concrete Presence of what I call "the Supreme Lord" (but we can call it by any name, it doesn't matter: Truth, Consciousness, whatever we like ‚Äî the words don't matter, it's something beyond all that). A concrete presence, there, like this (<em>Mother clenches her two fists as if to evoke a palpable solidity</em>), in all the cells, in the whole being. I went on doing all the absolutely trivial and tiny little things ‚Äî like bathing, the usual things, eating too, speaking ‚Äî and it stayed there. And it was as if telling me, "This is how it will be." A joy, a power, a blossoming ‚Äî extraordinary, to such a point that I wondered how it was that this (<em>body</em>) didn't change.... It's because THE STATE DIDN'T LAST LONG ENOUGH. It lasted for only about two hours (give or take a little); afterwards, back came the everyday routine, everyone with their problems, etc. (<em>Mother makes the familiar gesture of the "truckload" being dumped</em>). But I am not accusing anything of having made the state go away: it went away because this (<em>body</em>) isn't yet capable of holding it, that's all. That is to say, at that moment, while it was there, there was an intimation that I had to write a note.... That's what I wanted to tell you. I had to write a note. (<em>Mother breaks off abruptly, then speaks as if words were being dictated to her:</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-51">"Because of the necessities of the transformation, this body may enter a state of trance that will appear cataleptic....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-52">Then I knew it was Sri Aurobindo speaking, because he started taking his ironic tone, and he said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-55">I didn't have the time to write it down. But Sri Aurobindo himself said to me, "On Saturday, when you see Satprem."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-65">Because this intimation was very... imperative, it was an imperative necessity ‚Äî which to me seems to prove that it will happen. "Because of the necessities of the transformation..." That was when the experience was there and I became aware of all that had to change for this body to be capable of holding the thing constantly, for it to be there all the time. So that came. And I wanted to write it down, but didn't have the time, I was already terribly late; then came very clearly from Sri Aurobindo, "On Saturday, when Satprem is there."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-78" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-79">I have seen relatively clearly that that trance depended on the ratio between two aspects (the proportion between two aspects): that of the individual transformation (that is, the transformation of this body), and that of the general, collective and impersonal work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-80">If a certain balance is kept, that state (<em>of prolonged trance</em>) may be dispensed with, but then the same work which would have been done in a few weeks or a few months (I don't know) will extend over years ‚Äî years and years. So it's a question of patience ‚Äî patience isn't lacking. But it's not only a question of patience; it's a question of proportion: there must be a certain balance between the two, between the pressure from outside of the external work (not "external," the collective work), and the pressure on the body for its transformation. If wisdom is still there, that is, if the instrument is constantly and infallibly capable of doing exactly what is expected of it (to put it into words: the supreme Lord's precise will), then the trance would not be necessary. It would only be if there is a resistance in the execution (out of ignorance).</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-81">That's how I perceive it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-82">This possibility of transformation in trance was announced to the body about... yes, about sixty years ago, and periodically afterwards. And there has always been a prayer: "No, may it not be necessary: it's the method of laziness." It's the method of inertia. Now all those preferences, all that is gone. There is only an increasingly alerted, awakened consciousness, but awakened to the point of being alerted to the possibility of unconscious resistances, with the will for them to disappear. All depends on the plasticity, the receptivity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-83">You understand, even if this body is told, "You will have to last a hundred or two hundred years for the work to be done without trance," it says, "It's all the same to me." All it wants is to be conscious. All it wants is, "Lord, to be conscious of Your consciousness," nothing else. That's its sole, exclusive will: "To be conscious of Your consciousness," that is, to consciously become You in another mode. But it isn't in a hurry, because it has no reason to be in a hurry.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-84"><em>You said just before (if I understood rightly) that "state" could last for years. Were you referring to the state of trance?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-85">No, that's not possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-86"><em>It's not possible.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-87">No, it's not possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-88"><em>The duration of that trance doesn't depend on outward conditions, on the preparation of the world, for instance?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-89">I don't think so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-90">That's another possibility that came up in the past (but it's part of the vision of all the possibilities ‚Äî there are all kinds of possibilities). Once, there was that vision (I had it when Sri Aurobindo was here) of the whole town engulfed by bombs, I think (I don't remember now,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="8" href="#">1</a> but it wasn't lived: it was known, like something that had already been), and the engulfing had resulted in a sort of burying very deep underground, in a grotto with a radiant atmosphere, therefore the body was preserved. Then I woke up two thousand years later. And the experience began after those two thousand years: I saw how I had learned where I was and how I had come out of that grotto, how I knew the number of years that had elapsed, and so on. All that</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 25</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-91"> unfolded one day and I related it to Sri Aurobindo. He said to me, "It's one of the innumerable possibilities that offers itself up in order to be manifested." He didn't attach more importance to it than that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-92">All kinds of things are presented as possibilities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-93"><em>So you don't envisage the possibility of a long duration ‚Äî that trance won't be very long?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-94">I don't think that's materially possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-95"><em>And the purpose of that trance would basically be to fix the supramental vibration in the body?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-96">To transform what's not receptive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-97">There are billions of elements in the body, so it's a mixture of receptivity and non-receptivity. It's still mixed. And that mixture is why the appearance<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="8-1" href="#">2</a> remains what it is. Well then, to make everything receptive in every element is a work, you understand, a formidable work. If it had to be done in detail, it would be impossible, but through the pressure of the Force it can be done. So then, the trance would be made necessary precisely so that it's done quickly (relatively quickly). This work is BEING DONE (I am conscious of it), you understand (<em>laughing</em>), only it may stretch over hundreds of years! That's what Sri Aurobindo said: a state of consciousness has to be established in which the collective life of the cells can be preserved for as long as desired; that means the Lord's Will must be sufficiently active to keep the balance between all those elements for as long as necessary for all of them to change. And always, it has always been said that the most external form would be the last to change; that the whole internal, organic functioning would be changed before the external form, the appearance (it's only an appearance, of course); that the appearance would be the last to change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-98">It seems to me to be the legacy of primordial habits ‚Äî the habits of Matter. This Matter, of course, comes from total unconsciousness, and throughout the ages and all the ways of being, it returns to total consciousness ‚Äî it goes from one extreme to the other; well, it's these habits of static immobility that give this need for trance. It shouldn't be necessary. Only (how can I explain?...), logically, as things are, it depends on the balance between the body's capacity of receptivity and its external activity: it's obviously far more receptive when it is immobile, because its energies are occupied with the transformation.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 26</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-99">There is also another thing which could change the course of events: it's that the vital is becoming more and more receptive and collaborative. This whole vital zone, which was the zone of revolt and deliberate opposition to the divine transformation, is becoming more and more collaborative, and with its collaboration (because this vital zone is the zone of movement, action, energy put to use), with its conscious collaboration, the methods of transformation may become different (it's something I have been studying these last few days). It may change the methods. But that's a whole world to be learned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-100">One should become more and more not only attentive but receptive, with a precision for details which would mean that at each second one would know what had to be done and how it should be done (not outwardly: inwardly). These cells should learn to have at each second the attitude necessary for everything to unfold smoothly, in rhythm with the supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-101">To replace the need for immobility and immobile rest by the power of inner concentration and inner peace ‚Äî that peace which is perfectly independent of action, which can be there, unchanging, even in the midst of the most frantic actions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-102"><em>Is that where you envisage the vital's intervention?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-103">Yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-104"><em>I often wonder what the best possible attitude is for us. Is it better to be simply in a state of silence, open above, a wide silence, or...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-105">I think that's it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-106">But what's the alternative?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-107"><em>Or should one have, I don't know, a special concentration in our activities?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-108">No, because the transformation is the only thing that doesn't call for the mind's intervention: the mind befuddles everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-109">I clearly see what its use will be ‚Äî why there has been the mind, why it exists, what its use will be ‚Äî but that will come afterwards.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-110">The mind will be transformed quite naturally, effortlessly; it's not the same as with this body. But for the moment, it can't be used. It can be used only through aspiration, like this (<em>gesture open to the above</em>), a constant aspiration ‚Äî the constancy of aspiration and receptivity to let the forces and the light come through.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-111">There. So we'll meet again on Saturday.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-112"><em>I'll bring you the text of those "instructions."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-113">Yes. There's no hurry ‚Äî I don't think there is. It's better if it's ready, but ... The highest part of the consciousness is clearly in favour of the trance being unnecessary. And if the lower part becomes receptive enough in time, it won't be necessary. Or it will be reduced to very little. Just keep the text, that's all, keep it ready (<em>Mother laughs</em>).<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="9" href="#">3</a></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-120"><em>Soon afterwards</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-121">Something still rather indefinable is happening.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-122">The body was in the habit of fulfilling its functions automatically, as something natural, which means that for it, the question of their importance or usefulness did not arise: it didn't have that mental vision, for instance, or vital vision of things, of what's "important" or "interesting" and what isn't. That didn't exist. But now that the cells are becoming conscious, they seem to step back (<em>Mother makes a gesture of stepping back</em>): they look at themselves, they begin to watch themselves act, and they very much wonder, "What's the use of all this?" And then, an aspiration: "How? How should things truly be? What's our function, our usefulness, our basis? Yes, what should be our basis and our 'standard' of life?" To express it mentally again, we could say, "How will we be when we are divine? What will be the difference? What's the divine way of being?" And there, what speaks is that whole kind of physical base which is entirely made up of thousands of small things absolutely indifferent in themselves, whose raison d'√™tre is only as a whole, as a totality, like a support to another action, but which in themselves seem devoid of any meaning. And then, it's again the same thing: a sort of receptivity, of silent opening to let oneself be permeated, and a very subtle perception of a way of being that would be luminous, harmonious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-123">That way of being is still quite indefinable; but in this search there is a constant perception (which translates itself in vision) of a multicoloured light, of all the colours ‚Äî all the colours not in layers but as though (<em>stippling gesture</em>) a combination of dots, of all the colours. Two years ago (a little more than two years, I don't remember), when I met the Tantrics, when I came into contact with them, I started seeing that light, and I thought it was the "tantric light," the tantric way of seeing the material world. But now, I see it constantly, associated with everything, and it seems to be what we might call a "perception</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 29</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-124"> of true Matter." All possible colours are combined without being mixed together (<em>same stippling gesture</em>), and combined in luminous dots. Everything is as though made up of this. And it seems to be the true mode of being ‚Äî I am not yet sure, but in any case it's a far more conscious mode of being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-125">I see it all the time: with eyes open, eyes closed, all the time. And one has a strange perception (for the body), a strange perception of subtlety, permeability (if I may call it that), of suppleness of form, and not exactly an elimination but a considerable lessening of the rigidity of forms (the rigidity is eliminated, but not the forms: a suppleness in the forms). And for the body itself, the first few times it felt that in some part or the other, it had the impression of ... being a bit lost, with the sense of something eluding it. But if one remains very quiet and waits quietly, it's simply replaced by a sort of plasticity and fluidity that seems to be a new mode of the cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-126">It would be probably what on the material level must take the place of the physical ego; that is to say, the rigidity of the form seems to have to give way to this new way of being. Of course, the first contact is always very ... surprising. But the body is getting used to it little by little. What's a little difficult is the moment of transition from one way to the other. It's done very progressively, yet at the moment of transition there are a few seconds that are ... the least we can say is "unexpected."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-127">In that way, all habits are undone. It's the same with all the functionings: blood circulation, digestion, breathing ‚Äî all the functions. And at the moment of transition, it's not that one abruptly takes the place of the other, but there is a state of fluidity between the two which is ... difficult. It's only because of that great Faith, a perfectly still, luminous, constant, immutable faith in the real existence of the supreme Lord ‚Äî in the SOLE real existence of the Supreme ‚Äî that everything goes on apparently as it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-128">There are as if great waves of all the ordinary movements, ordinary ways of being, ordinary habits, which are pushed back and which come back again, and try to engulf and are pushed back again. And I can see that for years the body and the whole body consciousness used to rush back into the old way to seek safety, as a measure of safety, in order to elude; but now, the body has been persuaded not to do it any more and on the contrary to accept, "Well, if it's dissolution, let it be dissolution." But it accepts what will be.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-129">Mentally, when that happens in the physical mind (it was years ago, but I had observed that), it's what gives people the feeling that they're going insane, and they get frightened (and with fear things</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 30</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-130"> happen), so they rush back into ordinary common sense to escape it. It's the equivalent ‚Äî not the same thing, but the equivalent of what happens in the material: you feel all the usual stability is vanishing. Well, for a long time ‚Äî a long time ‚Äî there was that retreat into habit, and then you are quite at peace and you start all over again. But now, the cells no longer want that "Come what may, we'll see!" The great adventure.</p>

That's why the integral preparation of the consciousness must go hand in hand with the perception of the Power. And then, there are differences so subtle that for the understanding (I am not referring to the ordinary understanding, but even for a quite spiritualized and prepared state of consciousness, which is not THE consciousness), even an insignificant, almost imperceptible, tiny little movement could bring about a catastrophe.</p>

Illness is always a lapse into unconsciousness through the incapacity to sustain the movement of transformation. And death is the same thing ‚Äî the same thing, somewhat more total.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-158">"One should be careful not to scorn what one does not understand, for innumerable are the marvels sealed from our narrow view.<br/>

They have a sort of dumb admiration, which is looked upon as silly, for anything they don't understand. But they at least have goodwill. While the others on the lofty heights of their so-called intelligence, anything they don't understand is worthless. This man came here and said, "One can't work with these people, they are Indians!"

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-181">(<em>Laughing</em>) In the meantime, it makes a fine mess!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-182">The other method is much quicker: abolition. (I mean not only material abolition, but abolition of the PRINCIPLE of the thing; that's what I said: when you go beyond animality, the material fact no longer has any reason to be, so it falls away.) That's so to say immediate. But if you carry on until nausea ensues, that's another method!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-183"><em>Carrying on until nausea isn't the most dangerous thing; it's covering up this business with spirituality, making a "yoga of sexuality."</em></p>

Oh, I have to say I knew some old, very old people who were full of dirty things; but that was probably because they were repressed during their entire youth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-186">There is something very repugnant about it, isn't there, which people overcome in order to get the "pleasure"; but at bottom there is something very repugnant about it, which, as soon as the pleasure is gone, becomes thoroughly repugnant.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-187">Lots of sects and movements have been accused of practicing this kind of sexuality (I think it was the "moral" basis for the accusation against the Templars). It's probably the result of the Christian attitude; Christianity has spoken of "sin" and made it a sin, so there's the result. It's the reaction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-188">But as soon as you are capable of having the true Ananda, truly, spontaneously, it's absolutely repugnant, just like wallowing in mud.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-223">I have some interesting things to tell you. It's about this cold. An extraordinary healing power ... All the phases in their most acute form, with the study of the process, and each phase gone through in a few hours, or a few minutes (depending on what it was). Usually, when you have a cold, you go through one phase, then another (you know how it is), then it goes lower down, then you cough, then... All that was gone through quickly, and in two days it was over. And with the whole process, but not the mentalized process, not at all: the vibratory process, showing how the Force comes, acts, and at once... Oh, it was very, very interesting, because there was the part played by the inconscient, the part played by conscious reactions, the part played by the will (tremendous, an enormous part), the part played by mental suggestion (tremendous too), and... the action of the supreme Vibration. The whole thing in detail, day and night, constantly; to such a point that at moments I stood still, like that, to follow the course. And it lasted (I saw you on Saturday) for... Sunday, Monday, Tuesday: those three days.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-224">It's my fault it started; as I told you, I had complained about these sinuses which were a constant nuisance, and there was also that constant inflammation of the mouth and the throat. So it had its effect. I can't say it's fully over because there still remains a lot, quite a lot of the old habit, but it came with the intention of changing things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-225">And all this has been learned in detail from a vibratory point of view. It's very interesting, I haven't wasted my time!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-226"><em>Because what applies to a cold obviously applies to any disorder, doesn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-227">It's a detailed process for each case. That was one of the manifestations of a cold.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-228"><em>I mean, it could act on other illnesses too, couldn't it?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-229">Each illness represents its own vibratory mode. Each illness has</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-230"> its own vibratory mode; it represents a whole field of vibrations to be corrected. It's the EXACT measure of what in Matter resists the divine Influence ‚Äî the exact measure, down to the atom.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-231">Oh, how interesting it is, if you knew how interesting.... Take coughing, for instance (not in the chest, in the throat). So, the first vibration: an irritation that draws your attention in order to make you cough. It has a certain kind of vibration which we may call "pointed," but it's not violent: it's light, annoying. It's the first little vibration. So with that vibration: awakening of the attention in the surrounding consciousness (<em>of the throat cells</em>); then a refusal to accept the cough, a rejection here (<em>in the throat</em>), which at first almost causes nausea (all this is seen through a microscope, you understand, they are very tiny things). The attention is focused. Then, at that point, there are several possible factors, which are sometimes simultaneous and sometimes one drives away the other; one is anxiety: something goes wrong and there is apprehension at what's going to happen; the other is a will that nothing should be disturbed by the irritation; and then all of a sudden, the faith that the Force is capable of restoring order everywhere immediately (none of this is intellectual: it's vibrations).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-232">Then, sometime yesterday morning, something very interesting occurred: a clear perception that the vast majority of the cells (in THIS CASE: I'm not talking about the whole body, I am talking about this particular spot ‚Äî throat, nose, etc.), the vast majority of the cells still have a sort of feeling ‚Äî which seems to be the result of innumerable experiences or of habits (it's both; not clearly one or the other, but both) ‚Äî that Nature's force, that is to say, the nature governing the body, knows what needs to be done better than the divine Power: it's "used to it," it "knows better." That's how it is. And then, when this new consciousness which is being worked out in the physical being (<em>the mind of the cells</em>) has caught hold of that, oh, it was as if it had caught hold of an extraordinary revelation; it said, "Ah, I've got you, you culprit! You are the one who is preventing the transformation."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-233">It was tremendously interesting. Tremendously interesting!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-234">All this is magnified in order to be expressed, but it's on the scale of the body's cells. And there was something like a flash of luminous Power as soon as that was discovered: it came down like that, brrm! (<em>gesture like a sword of light plunging into Matter</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-235">And it hasn't gone away since then. To the extent that I tried to recall that state of consciousness in order to note it down in detail ‚Äî it no longer exists.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 44</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-236">Those actions are ... miraculous, but in tiny details, you see, which is why they don't look miraculous: because they are only actions in details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-237">The attitude taken by the cells, the action of the will, the habit of Nature, the Intervention ‚Äî all that was seen minutely, phase after phase. Because these cells (<em>in the throat</em>) were complaining; they were the ones that said things weren't changing, that they remained as they were. They clearly saw that things were kept under control, but there was no sign of transformation. And that cold came as a magnifying glass, you understand. It came and magnified everything so it would become more visible and more easily observed. And the detail of all that's going on is, oh, really marvellous: it's a whole world, and they are tiny little things that generally go unobserved because we observe mentally. But like that... For instance, at a certain point during those successive phases, all the signs are there that the body's will is going to flag and that you are going either to faint or to fall "sick" for a while. Then comes the choice made within by the cells, which weigh up the possibilities from the standpoint of the progress of transformation: "What can act? What can be the most useful in order to produce the greatest result? Is it to yield and have an apparent fall (it's only apparent), and in that fall, to allow the Force to do its work without interference; or is it to follow the course of conscious transformation?" And that's where this marvellous discovery of the cells came in: they really felt Nature knew better (<em>laughing</em>) because it was used to it. That was exquisite! Admirable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-238">All this must be going on in everyone, only people are unconscious. It's the consciousness of the cells which has awakened, you understand. It's so interesting!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-239">I am now fully aware of the causes of allergy (studied in detail), and why cases of allergy are multiplying here in the Ashram. Naturally, it's based on... (<em>Mother starts coughing and concludes:</em>) Ah, forbidden topic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-240">(<em>After a moment of silence, Mother resumes:</em>) It's the nerves that become more and more receptive to the Force (and consequently, more and more sensitive), and they don't have the wisdom or equilibrium necessary to counterbalance the increase in sensitivity. But then, the doctors' treatment is idiotic! What would be needed is just the opposite: what's needed is (how can I put it?) to breathe wisdom and peace into the body, not to deaden it.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 45</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-241">Yesterday evening, something amusing happened. I received some soups from Japan. It was all written in Japanese, impossible to read. When the doctor came (he comes every evening), I asked him, "Would you like to try a Japanese soup?" And I gave him a packet to take with him. Yesterday evening, when he came back, I asked him, "Did you taste the Japanese soup?" He said, "It's shellfish soup," and he added, "It's not good for you." I asked him, "Why is it not good for me?" (I asked him just for information, to know what my "illness" was(!), why I couldn't eat shellfish?) He answered me, "Oh, you would have an allergic reaction." Then I looked at him and, with great force, said to him, "I have NO allergic reactions." (<em>Mother laughs</em>) The poor man! He gave a shudder ... and he is down with fever!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-242">It's true that now, as soon as the nerves (but you know, it's an observation of every second), as soon as the nerves start protesting ... and it happens very often when they are interested in a sensation: they become interested in a sensation, they concentrate and follow it, then suddenly, it exceeds ... (how should I put it?) the amount they are used to considering as pleasant (it can be put that way), so there's a slight tipping over and they start going wrong, they start protesting. But if there is observation, there is the action of the inner "mentor" that tells them, "Now, all sensations can be borne almost to their maximum: it's quite simply a bad habit and a lack of plasticity. Remain calm and you will see." (Something of the sort.) Then they are docile, they stay calm, and ... everything smoothes out. Smoothes out, and then ... the allergic reaction is over. So I think I've learned the knack! That's why I answered the doctor with such force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-243">It's very amusing. That's how you learn things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-244">Only, how to communicate this to people? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-245">It's a very subtle observation, so subtle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-246">At the same time, there is another factor (oh, there are several methods). You have a small material action to do (quite uninteresting in itself, but anyway, it has to be done) and there is precisely that inner disquiet which can cause things to tip over to the wrong side at any moment; if the consciousness ‚Äî the total consciousness of the body ‚Äî is busy with something else; it goes away without your noticing it. So there is this possibility: of keeping the consciousness interested in something else. But then the possibility of illness or disorder isn't cured. So it's a constant choice between the work of transformation and (or) an equilibrium sufficient to go on with the general work.</p>

Well, I noticed (she went out around two; every day I get up at 4:30), I noticed that during those two and a half hours I didn't sleep ("didn't sleep," I mean I didn't exteriorize). And I wasn't "thinking" (thank God!), there was simply a kind of consciousness watching. And time went by with such fantastic speed that I was myself flabbergasted.

It occurred apropos of a young disciple who did not understand how everything ‚Äî impulsions, desires, etc. ‚Äî could come from "outside," from universal Nature, as Sri Aurobindo moreover declares, "I become what I see in myself."</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-273">I told him once that he would begin to be intelligent when he could set all opposites face to face and make a synthesis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-274">What they lack is the sense of the fourth dimension, so they don't understand. There, everything holds together, in a very concrete, palpable way, the "outside" and the "inside".</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-275">Th√©on, for his part, insisted very much on adverse forces, while Sri Aurobindo didn't talk about them. So when I came here I asked him, "But do hostile beings and adverse forces exist?" He said to me, "Yes, they exist, but in order to master them it's easier to regard them as being outside, rather than inside as a part of your nature." He insisted on the One: everything is the One distorted to a greater or lesser extent, even the "adverse" forces. What we call "adverse forces" are, at bottom, distortions of consciousness. When those distortions</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 49</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-276"> predominate in a being, that is to say, when his nature obeys distorted influences and no longer responds to the divine influence, we may call it a "hostile being" (they do exist, God knows!). But here in India, they have insisted above all on the notion of Oneness. Of course, at the origin of the worlds a separation took place, but it's mainly the Tantrics who have insisted on that; they say that in order to re-form Godhead, the two poles must be reunited.... All this is words, a manner of speaking that fills the gaps and complements each other. And depending on the individuals, the times and countries, there were manners of speaking more or less pure, some closer than others. But all said and done... We could say that the Lord enjoys narrating Himself in all possible ways.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-277">And when you are on the very lowest rung of the ladder of consciousness, those manners of speaking become increasingly concrete, absolute, hard, and exclusive of all that isn't themselves: those are religions.... Oh, by the way, it seems the Pope was approached about Auroville and he asked if there would be a Catholic church!... They put the question to me. I said, "No. No churches, no temples."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-278">But it might be amusing if we put together one specimen of every religion from every country and every epoch. A city of religions, can you see that?... The totem pole next to the cathedral! Oh, that would be very amusing! All the ancient religions ‚Äî the Egyptian, the Tyrian, the Scandinavian gods ... ‚Äî and then the new religions.</p>

The explanations could be read out by some guide or other, but they would be prepared by someone with a slightly higher vision (oh, not a supramental vision, just a slightly higher one), and who would show human creeds and how men have shed blood in the name of "God."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-282">The most bloodthirsty god is the most popular, I think. All the slaughters, all the horrors, all the tortures that have been committed in the name of God ...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-290">Yet outwardly, it's apparent chaos.... You know, an equilibrium is made up of a multitude of interlockings which hold together creating stability. But when you want to move on to a higher equilibrium, all that must be disintegrated, so to speak (<em>gesture of a pyramid being flattened</em>), then encompassed in a broader way, and all the interlockings must be formed again on a higher level. It's the transition from one to the other that's difficult. The disequilibrium is what prepares a new equilibrium.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-291">We are in the middle of the chaos.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-292">And the only solution at such a time is to draw back, as it were (<em>gesture of drawing within</em>), and hang on unshakeably to something higher, fasten on to it while the hurricane passes by. Then you can go through.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-302">All these last days I have been considering the proportion that should be maintained between what was accomplished and established in the past and the attitude of complete acceptance of what comes from the future.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-303">There is obviously in Nature a tendency to want a slow transformation from what was habitually regarded as "good" (expressive, good, harmonious) to the new Thing. And I was observing the extent to which there is attachment: the attachment of habit, something very spontaneous and uncalculating. Then recently (yesterday), I had an amusing example.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-304">Do you know little S.?<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="17" href="#">1</a> Have you ever spoken to her?... I've heard she beats sixteen-and seventeen-year-old boys at logic and new mathematics. I saw her today. She is obviously quite remarkably intelligent. And yesterday was her birthday. You know that Y. (<em>her adoptive mother</em>) has gone into hospital; and when she went she asked me to send something to Thoth every day (you know who Thoth<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="18" href="#">2</a> is don't you?), because it seems that whenever he receives something from me, he is quite calm for two hours. Very well. So I sent something the first day (that was yesterday). And yesterday was little S.'s birthday. I thought that rather than for her to fetch from the secretary the fruit I give for Thoth, it would be better if she came to see me at ten and I'd give her her card and her bouquet of flowers at the same time. But then, everything is disorganized and not very <em>efficient</em>: she wasn't informed. When she came it was too late because it was 10:30 or 11 while I had said "before ten." So she wrote me a letter.... I saw the girl today, she is really very intelligent, no doubt about that, and here is her letter. (Note that when she came to live with Y., she knew French because she had learned it with the Sisters ‚Äî she was a pupil at the "Mission" some three years ago ‚Äî and for three years Y. has been giving her French lessons.) So here is the child's letter:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-305" style="text-align: right;">(<em>translation</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-306">Sweet Mother,<br/>

<p class="p-num">Page 53</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-308" style="text-align: right;">S.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-309">It's not French, of course. You clearly feel that the thought isn't ordinary.... I found that very interesting. But for a French class, it would be riddled with errors.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-310"><em>Yes, but there is a "tone" in it....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-311">Exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-312">I was surprised, because Y. (<em>the adoptive mother</em>) knows French well, obviously, and she is quite capable of teaching her to write correctly: she hasn't taken the trouble (or didn't want to), I don't know why. But there is a certain force there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-313"><em>Oh, yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-314">It's interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-315">And after all, what we want ... we know that we need, not an artificially new language, but something supple enough to be able to adapt to the needs of a new CONSCIOUSNESS; and that's probably how that language will emerge, from a number of old languages, through the elimination of habits.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-316">What's specific to each language (apart from a few differences in words) is the order in which ideas are presented: the construction of sentences. The Japanese (and especially the Chinese) have solved the problem by using only the sign of the idea. Now, under the influence from outside, they have added phonetic signs to build a sentence; but even now the order in the construction of the ideas is different. It's different in Japan and different in China. And unless you FEEL this, you can never know a foreign language really well. So we speak according to our very old habit (and basically it's more convenient for us simply because it comes automatically). But when I "receive," for instance, it's not even a thought: it's Sri Aurobindo's formulated consciousness; then, there is a sort of progressive approximation of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 54</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-317"> the expression, and sometimes it comes very clearly; but very often it's a spontaneous mixture of French and English forms and I feel it is something else trying to be expressed. At times (it follows the notation), it makes me correct something; at other times it comes perfectly well ‚Äî it depends.... Oh, it depends on the limpidity. If you are very tranquil, it comes very well. And there, too, I see it's not really French and not really English. It's not so much the words (words are nothing) as the ORDER in which things come up. And when afterwards I look at it objectively, I see it's in part the order in which they come in French, and in part the order in which they come in English. And the result is a mixture, which is neither one language nor the other, and endeavours to express... what might be called "a new way of consciousness."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-318">It leads me to think that something will be worked out that way, and that any too strict, too narrow attachment to the old rules is a hindrance to the evolution of expression. From that point of view, French is a long way behind English ‚Äî English is much more supple. But the languages in countries like China and Japan that use ideograms seem to be infinitely more supple than our own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-319"><em>Surely!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-320">They can express new ideas and new things far more easily through the juxtaposition of signs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-321">But now, with this "new logic" and "new mathematics," a whole set of new signs is beginning to be universal, that is to say, the same signs express the same ideas or things in all countries, whatever language is used in the country, quite independently.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-322">These new thoughts and new experiences, this new logic and new mathematics, are now taught in higher studies, but all the primary and secondary studies have remained in the old formula, so I have been very seriously thinking of opening primary and secondary schools in Auroville, based on the new system ‚Äî as a trial.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-323"><em>But how is it done? It's a problem that interests me very much: how do you catch this new expression?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-324">It can only be done ... This is my experience: if I want to express clearly what Sri Aurobindo says (he doesn't "say," I don't know how to explain it ... it's his consciousness doing this ‚Äî <em>gesture of projection</em> ‚Äî expressing itself), well, first the mind must be silent, that goes without saying. But the difficulty is the passage to expression; that's</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 55</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-325"> what I have studied and where I have seen the extent of that sort of spontaneous and automatic attachment to the old habits.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-326"><em>Yes!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-327">So what should be done there (and what I am trying to do) is the same work of receptive silence and to let inspiration, the inspirational consciousness, gather the necessary elements. For that we must be very tranquil. We must be very supple, in the sense of <em>surrendered</em>; I mean, allow as little habitual activity as possible to mix in ‚Äî be almost like an automaton. But with the full perception of the consciousness trying to be expressed, so that nothing gets mixed in with it. That's the most important thing: to receive this consciousness and hold it like ... really like something sacred, without anything getting mixed in with it, like that. So then, there is a problem of attraction, we could say, and of concretization in the formula.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">4</a> I always tell myself that if I knew many languages, it would make use of all that; unfortunately I know only two (I "know" only two thoroughly) and I have only very superficial and minimal glimpses of two or three others ‚Äî that's not enough. Only, I have been in contact with very different methods: the method of the Far East and the Sanskrit method, and of course the methods of the West. It does give a sort of base, but it's not sufficient ‚Äî I am at the opposite extreme from erudition. I have always felt that erudition shrivels up thought ‚Äî it parches the brain. (But I have great respect for scholars, oh! indeed, and I seek their advice, but... for myself it won't do!)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-328">Once, very long ago, when Sri Aurobindo was telling me about himself, that is, of his childhood, his education, I put the question to him, I asked him, "Why am I, as an individual being, so mediocre? I can do anything; all that I have tried to do I have done, but never in a superior way: always like this (<em>gesture to an average level</em>)." Then he answered me (at the time I took it as a kindness or commiseration), "That's because it gives great suppleness ‚Äî a great suppleness and a vast scope; because those who have perfection are concentrated and specialized." As I said, I took it simply like a caress to comfort a child. But now I realize that the most important thing is not to have any fixity: nothing should be set, definitive, like the sense of a perfection in the realization ‚Äî that puts a total stop to the forward march. The sense of incapacity (with the meaning I said of mediocrity, of something by no means exceptional) leaves you in a sort of expectation (<em>gesture of aspiration upward</em>) of something better. And then, the most</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 56</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-329"> important thing is suppleness ‚Äî suppleness, suppleness. Suppleness and breadth: reject nothing as useless or bad or inferior ‚Äî nothing; set nothing up as really superior and beautiful ‚Äî nothing. Remain ever open, ever open.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-330">The ideal is to have this suppleness and receptivity and surrender, that is, so total an acceptance of the Influence that no matter what comes the instrument adapts itself instantly to express it naturally, spontaneously and effortlessly.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-332">The nature (<em>of Mother</em>) was rather shy, and as a matter of fact, there wasn't much confidence in the personal capacity (although there was the sense of being able to do anything, if the need arose). Till the age of twenty or twenty-one I spoke very little, and never, never anything like a speech. I wouldn't take part in conversations: I would listen, but speak very little.... Then I was put in touch with Abdul Baha (the "Bahai"), who was then in Paris, and a sort of intimacy grew between us. I used to go to his gatherings because I was interested. And one day (when I was in his room), he said to me, "I am sick, I can't speak; go and speak for me." I said, "Me! But I don't speak." He replied, "You just have to go there, sit quietly and concentrate, and what you have to say will come to you. Go and do it, you will see." Well then (<em>laughing</em>), I did as he said. There were some thirty or forty people. I went and sat in their midst, stayed very still, and then ... I sat like that, without a thought, nothing, and suddenly I started speaking. I spoke to them for half an hour (I don't even know what I told them), and when it was over everybody was quite pleased. I went to find Abdul Baha, who told me, "You spoke admirably." I said, "It wasn't me!" And from that day (I had got the knack from him, you understand!), I would stay like that, very still, and everything would come. It's especially the sense of the "I" that must be lost ‚Äî that's the great art in everything, for everything, for everything you do: for painting, for ... (I did painting, sculpture, architecture even, I did music), for everything, but everything, if you are able to lose the sense of the "I," then you open yourself to ... to the knowledge of the thing (sculpture, painting, etc.). It's not necessarily beings, but the spirit of the thing that uses you.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-366">We may say that all experiences tend towards a single revelation ‚Äî that consciousness alone exists. And that it is the decision or choice (the words are inaccurate), a decision of the consciousness that creates the form ‚Äî all forms, from the most subtle to the most material ones; and the material world, the apparent fixity of the material world results from a distortion or a darkening of the consciousness, which has lost the sense of its all-powerfulness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-367">This distortion has been still more pronounced since the advent of the mind, which in its working, has taken the place of consciousness so much that it has substituted itself for consciousness as it were, and to the extent that the mind, in its ordinary working, cannot be distinguished from consciousness ‚Äî it doesn't know what consciousness is, and so ... (<em>Mother makes a gesture expressing a shrinking or hardening</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-368">It's becoming very, very precise, very clear, very visible in the developed human mind. For the functioning of the body, for example, the difference between the action and perception of the consciousness, and the action and perception of the mind. And in our world as it's still organized, the mind is more ... (oh, it is a very interesting impression) much more concrete ‚Äî "concrete" in the sense of what we are in the habit (the bad habit) of calling "real" ‚Äî and fixed. It's not translucent, not fluid; it's not plastic, not fluid: it's mental, concrete. And then, the mind needs acquired knowledge and all the contacts with the outside.... Let's take a disorder in the body's functioning (which may come for all kinds of reasons that are very interesting to observe, but anyhow, we can't speak of everything at the same</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-369"> time), the disorder is there and is expressed through a sense of discomfort; the way the consciousness behaves and acts and the way the mind behaves and acts are entirely, absolutely different (we can't say opposite, but absolutely different). Then there is the weakness (I am talking about the sensation of the body itself), the weakness arising from old habit. It's not a lack of faith, the body knows in an almost absolute way that there is only one salvation, one saviour: THE Consciousness. But there is a weakness that causes a sort of slackening, a letting go to habit, and that's where an intensity of faith is needed ‚Äî but an energy in the faith ‚Äî in order not to yield. This goes on in a very small sphere, you understand, it's a question ... not even of minutes ‚Äî of seconds. And if there is a letting go, it means illness; while the other way (<em>of the consciousness</em>) means, little by little, little by little, the unreality of the disorder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-370">But it means an intensity of faith which, compared to the present state of mankind, may be regarded as miraculous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-371">And the acceptance of illness is the acceptance of the usual end, which is generally called "death" (that doesn't mean anything), but anyway, it means that the aggregate is unable to be transformed and is dissolved.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-372">These are things (<em>those "seconds"</em>) that happen very often, and without any relationship whatever to outer circumstances. Which means that if one were all alone ‚Äî all alone, immobile, in meditation ‚Äî it would be more radical and definitive. But it's mixed in with the movement of life, with outer circumstances, and because of the necessities of those outer circumstances it goes more or less unnoticed.

<p class="Ps">(<em>Then it is question of Mother's last birthday, on February 21, and the difficulty in containing the increasingly chaotic stream of outer activities.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-379">I live amidst a growing confusion. It has one advantage, I see that very clearly: there can no longer be any automatism. When you live a well-organized life, things become automatic ‚Äî that's not possible anymore, at each minute the consciousness must be like a guiding light that is projected in order to know what must be done. I clearly see it's meant to be like that. It's deliberate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-380">Some of the things I said in the Talk you've just read to me today, were true at the time, are still true for the majority of people, but are no longer true for me....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="22" href="#">1</a> To the present vision, there is nothing that isn't willed and doesn't come <em>purposely</em> (not exactly deliberately, but with a precise aim in view), and it is AT THE SAME TIME a complete, multifaceted and integral whole (which is why it's very difficult to grasp). But now the thing is very clearly felt. And that is since two or three days, following a very minute observation ‚Äî precise and minute... The centre of consciousness is fairly high up (<em>gesture far above the head</em>); in the past it was always there (<em>gesture near the top of</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 66</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-381"> <em>the head)</em> and it would see things around and inside, but it seems to have ascended and the field of the consciousness is much vaster. Also, the body has become transparent, so to speak, and almost nonexistent; I don't know how to put it ... it doesn't obstruct the vibrations: all vibrations can go through. For example (I'll give an example to make myself understood, omitting details deliberately), I was asked for a certain amount of money, an increase. (On the material level a certain number of things are controlled ‚Äî <em>by Mother</em> ‚Äî from here, and which I have to pay for regularly.) So then, an increase was asked for. Not that the request was unreasonable, that's not it (it was an increase for something special, a daily increase), but I don't know why (because here ‚Äî <em>gesture to the forehead</em> ‚Äî nothing happens, I am absolutely, not only <em>blank</em>, but transparent, and everything is allowed to go through unobstructed), when I had to take the decision, there was immediately a vision (but a vision, as I said, from above, which sees over a much larger field), of conflict, battle, and to the observation there was something (<em>in Mother</em>) very much displeased, like a protest. I wondered why. If it had been translated into words, there would have been indignation at that request (without there being in the consciousness the least reason for this indignation: it all becomes very, very impersonal ‚Äî very impersonal). I went on looking with the vision of the consciousness, and then, as if automatically, through this mouth I asked how much this increase would amount to per week (because even the mental state that enables you to calculate isn't there at all: it's only a question of consciousness). I asked someone who was there, and he told me. Then, there immediately came the decision: "I will give so much once a week." And everything calmed down. Why and how and who? I haven't the faintest idea.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-382">So I am forced to conclude that it's a highly superior consciousness which sees things with reasons that completely elude us, sees how things must be done and sets them in motion (<em>global gesture to indicate the play of forces</em>) until they are done as they must be done. And where there was a person, it no longer exists ‚Äî there are no more "persons": there are forces in movement that bring about certain material actions, but no more persons.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-383">Since then, there has been an observation: I have noticed that everything concerning this body has become like that. So the body itself has barely the sense of its limits (<em>gesture as if the delimiting form had melted</em>). It's fairly new. I can see it has come about rather progressively, but it's fairly new, so it's hard to express. But it's this same body that no longer feels those limits (<em>same gesture</em>): it feels spread out in everything it does, in everything around it, in all things, people,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 67</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-384"> movements, sensations, in all that.... It's spread out like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-385">It has become very amusing, very interesting. It's really new.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-386">And it has become more precise after February 21. There were one or two very difficult days around the birthday, then a kind of adjustment took place inside, and afterwards came the experience. It was the outcome. There really is a change.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-387">One has to be a little attentive and careful not to bump into things or drop them: the gestures are somewhat wobbly. It's very interesting. It must be a transitional phase, which will last until THE true consciousness is established; then it will have a wholly different functioning from the one it had previously, but with a precision that one can foresee will be incalculable. And of a very different order. With many things, for instance, the vision is clearer with eyes closed than with eyes open, but the same clarity is beginning (it began long ago), beginning to come with open eyes; they see differently (<em>gesture showing the inside of things</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-388">There are amusing details on the whole, but I will tell you about them later because they involve certain people, so I'd rather not talk (the details are interesting only with the names), I'd rather not talk about them right now.... It is regarding the "power of the Mother" and how it will manifest ‚Äî amusing things, ambitions perhaps (it took on the appearance of ambitions), but I am watching (the "I" above ‚Äî the true "I" is watching to see if it corresponds to a concrete reality).... From a quite external and ordinary point of view (and it's not like that, it's not SEEN like that), but expressed in the human consciousness, those are ambitions caused by the fact that the material age is increasing (<em>Mother has just turned 89</em>) and so one may foresee ... (<em>laughing</em>) my disappearance. It's very amusing. But I'll tell you about it later.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-389">Very well. (<em>Mother laughs a lot</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-390"><em>You must see some funny things!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-391">It remains to see when I'll disappear!... Sri Aurobindo said to me, "Your body on earth..." He said, "What I see is that your body is the only one that has sufficient endurance to go through the ordeal." But, you understand, this body knew nothing about it, it has no ambitions (!), still less pretensions. But basing myself on that, when he told me, "You will do the work," I said yes. So there we are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-392">But now, I see ‚Äî I have seen: to hold on is hard. It's hard. It takes both an unflinching energy ‚Äî a constant energy, like this (<em>inflexible gesture</em>) ‚Äî and at the same time, a perfect humility ready to abandon</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 68</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-393"> EVERYTHING, because all that is, is nothing in comparison with what must be. A perfect humility. I don't think there are many bodies like that. It really (<em>laughing</em>) has goodwill!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-394">Oh, these last few days there have been moments ... a few minutes (it could hardly last more) when it was really hard. And then, what makes it possible for the body to go through is that at such moments, it's completely like this (<em>gesture of surrender</em>): "Lord, what You will." Nothing, no thought, no speculation ‚Äî nothing: "What You will." And "You alone exist." That's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-395">Moments of anguish, you know ... in an ordinary consciousness it would find expression in physical pains that are hard to bear, but the Grace is there ‚Äî the UNREALITY OF THE SUFFERING is there, fortunately.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-396">Oh, a marvellous Grace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-397">So then, the result (these few days were difficult), the result is this: that the body itself has truly changed consciousness. Its consciousness is up above: there's nothing left here inside, it's all like that, like something everything goes through.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-398" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-399">It may have one ambition (it's expressed as an aspiration, at any rate): the possibility of making this unreality of suffering felt everywhere. When the possibility is glimpsed of transmitting everywhere the unreality of suffering, there is a joy ‚Äî there is a light, a joy in the body. That makes it happy.

There were two bunches: one was bigger, the other not so big; I don't know for whom was the biggest and for whom was the other: they came from both sides, they were presented like this (<em>gesture to the right and to the left of Mother</em>). One was on a plate, the other on a square of white paper. I presumed the one on the square of white paper was for me!</p>

I replied from my experience that that's not the way levitation works, it's not because one escapes from the law of gravity: it's because physical bodies are supported by materialized vital forces (slightly materialized). So then, it put me back in contact with those forces and beings, and last night they said that to me; they told me, "Why aren't you using us any longer? We were quite happy!" I said, "Come along and do some work!" And there you are (<em>the grapes</em>).</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-413">Yes, this problem of the transformation, I see more and more clearly that there are three approaches, three ways to go about it, and that in order to be more complete, one should combine the three.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-414">One ‚Äî the most important, naturally ‚Äî is the way we could call "spiritual," which is that of the contact with the Consciousness ‚Äî Love-Consciousness-Power, that is; these three aspects: supreme Love-Consciousness-Power. And the contact, the identification: to make all the material cells capable of receiving Him and expressing Him ‚Äî of BEING That.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-415">Of all the ways, that is the most powerful and the most indispensable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-416">There is the occult way, which brings all the intermediary worlds into play. There is a very detailed knowledge of all the powers and personalities, all the intermediary regions, and it makes use of all that.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24-1" href="#">2</a> That's where one makes use of the Overmind godheads: it's in this second way. Shiva, Krishna, all the aspects of the Mother are part of this second way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-417">Then there is the higher intellectual approach, which is the projection of a surpassing scientific mind and takes up the problem from below. It has its importance too. From the standpoint of the detail of the operation, it reduces approximation, it gives a more direct and precise action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-418">If one can combine all three, then obviously the thing will go faster.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-422">I've received a certain number of questions from the older students (not the young children, the older students) on "death," the conditions of death, why are there are so many accidents at present, and so on. I have already answered two persons. Of course, the answer is on a mental level, but with an attempt to go beyond.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-423">It is that sort of mental logic which wants ... yes, which wants things to be deduced one from the other according to that logic, and so they have arrived at ... impossible questions.</p>
<p class="Q">(<em>the text of the questions:</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-424"><em>Are the time and manner of death always chosen by the soul? In huge human destructions through bombings, floods, earthquakes, have all the souls chosen to die together at that time?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-425">The vast majority of human beings have a collective destiny. For them, the question does not arise.<br/>
One who has an individualized psychic being can survive even in the midst of collective catastrophes, if such is the choice of his soul.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-426"><em>How is the soul conscious of being and existing after death, once it is separated from its physical, vital and mental beings?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-427">The soul is a spark of the Supreme Divine, I do not see how the Lord needs a body in order to be conscious of being.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 72</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-428">It's nothing very new, but it's a broadening of the consciousness. And all these questions have in fact been coming into the atmosphere lately, giving at first the impression that man knows nothing about death ‚Äî he doesn't know what it is, doesn't know what happens, he has built all kinds of hypotheses but has no certainties. And by pressing on ‚Äî by insisting and pressing on ‚Äî I have reached the conclusion ... that there is really no such thing as death.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-429">There is only an appearance, and an appearance based on a limited view. But there is no radical change in the vibration of the consciousness. This came as an answer to a sort of anguish ‚Äî there was in the cells a sort of anguish at not knowing what death really is; a sort of anguish, like that. And the response was very clear and very persistent: it was that the consciousness alone can know, because ... because the importance attached to the difference of state is a merely superficial difference based on an ignorance of the phenomenon in itself. One who could retain a means of communication would be able to say that as far as he himself is concerned, it doesn't make much difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-430">But this is something which is being worked out. There still remain grey areas and some details of the experience are missing. So it would be better to wait, it seems to me, until the knowledge is more complete, because rather than give an approximation with assumptions, it would be better to give the complete fact with the total experience. So we'll put it off till later.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-431"><em>But you say there is no difference.... When one is on the other side, does one go on having, or is one able to have, the perception of the physical world?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-432">Yes, yes! Exactly. Exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-433"><em>The perception of beings, of... [I meant to say seagulls over the sea, trees, the pretty sunshine on the earth].</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-434">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-435">Only, instead of having a perception... You leave a sort of illusory state and a perception which is a perception of appearances, but you do have a perception. That is to say, at certain times I had the perception, I was able to see the difference, but of course, the experience wasn't total (it wasn't total in the sense that it was interrupted by people), so it's better to wait awhile before we talk about it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-436">But the perception is there.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 73</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-437">Not absolutely identical, but with an effectiveness which is sometimes greater in itself. But it's not really perceived by the other side. I don't know how to explain. I've had the example (not an example: it was lived with the full perception) of a being who lived with me for years, who remained in perfectly conscious contact after he had left his body (and left it quite materially), and who didn't merge, but closely associated himself with another living being and in this association went on living the life of his OWN CONSCIOUSNESS. I can give neither the names nor the facts about all this, but it's as concrete as can be.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="25" href="#">1</a> And it's going on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-438">All this has been seen ‚Äî I've been seeing it for a long time, but just this morning it came back as an illustration of the new knowledge. Extraordinarily concrete (<em>the "association"</em>) in its effects, changing the capacities and movements of the other's consciousness. And consciously ‚Äî an absolutely conscious life. And it's the same consciousness that was conscious during the phase when there was no body left at all and the presence was visible only in the nocturnal vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-439">There are other cases.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-440">This one is very close and intimate, which is why I have been able to follow it in all its details.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-441">But it's clear, precise and EVIDENT only with this new vision, because (how can I explain?...) I knew this ‚Äî I knew it before, I knew it ‚Äî but I saw it again with the new consciousness, the new way of seeing, and then the understanding was total, the perception was total, absolutely concrete, with elements that were completely missing ‚Äî convincing elements that were completely missing in the first perception, which was a vital-mental knowledge. While this is a knowledge of the consciousness of the cells.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-442">But all this would only be interesting with all the facts (which can't be given). So I'd like to have a more complete and "impersonal" experience, you might say, I mean not illustrated by facts but an overall vision of the process. Then I will be able to talk about it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-461"><em>Soon afterwards</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-462">It's quite amusing, all the experiences that one has in the vital, in the mind and above, are occurring in the material, in the cellular consciousness, and they are a reproduction, as it were, but with a slight alteration caused by Matter. When you stir water, for instance, when you agitate it, it's no longer transparent; there are movements, and those movements prevent the water from being transparent. You can no longer see through it. It's the same thing materially: when you are restless, when you don't have that sort of calm (which isn't stillness but the opposite of restlessness, I don't know how to describe it ‚Äî it's something imperturbable). Very few people have that, and when</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 76</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-463"> they come near, there are immediately ... (<em>gesture of trepidation and seething in the atmosphere</em>) vibrations, disorder and confusion settle in. You can see it occur on a small scale with people coming here; you can see it on a larger scale with the movements of the Ashram; and you can see it on an even larger scale with the movements of the earth. It's the same thing with that sort of mental restlessness people have (excitement and restlessness): as soon as there is excitement and restlessness, it's impossible to see clearly; it's the same as with water, it goes like this (<em>same gesture of trepidation and seething</em>), lots of movements of confusion, and you can't see anything. It's the same thing materially. And then, as soon as a problem has to be solved (especially a material problem), people are in the habit of getting restless, and as soon as they get restless, it's absolutely impossible to find any solution. And it makes the confusion worse.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-464">This is something I experience constantly, every minute. If I am in my normal atmosphere, however intense the action may be (or also the intensity of the problem to be solved), one sees clearly, and the solution imposes itself as something absolute, irrevocable: this is how it must be done. The minute the restless atmosphere of someone else comes in (and as soon as a problem arises, there is not one in a thousand who doesn't become restless, at least inwardly a little), it starts going like this (<em>same gesture of trepidation</em>), and not only do you stop seeing, but things are no longer in their place! And so the solution ... you have to mend the disorder before you can think of the solution. It's an experience of almost every moment. I see numerous people; with some, as soon as they enter the atmosphere, their confusion enters with them, and you can't see anything anymore ‚Äî you have to wait a little, try and calm things down, and then you can see. With some it never calms down ‚Äî it's hopeless, you can only send them back. With others, it calms down after a certain length of time, then you can begin to see and know what needs to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-465">But materially it results in something very interesting. When I am alone and everything is tranquil in my atmosphere, at any moment I can take anything, any object: it's exactly in its place. And everything goes without a hitch. As soon as someone (anyone) is there, as soon as someone is there, there is a little vibration (<em>same gesture of trepidation</em>). With some people the vibration gets much worse ‚Äî and I lose my things! I lose them almost irretrievably ... until the atmosphere has calmed down again. Then the thing comes back quite naturally, almost as if it had gone away and come back ‚Äî it didn't go away and come back: it was only the confusion veiling everything. And I find the place again, the thing in its exact place. This goes on from</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 77</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-466"> morning to night (I can't say from night to morning because I go off into another region!). But it's constant. And so I feel I am living in constant confusion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-467">At times it is rather difficult. For instance, here in the mornings, when there are three or four sources of confusion at the same time, it becomes acute. I have only one solution, that is to be alone somewhere or other and stay like this (<em>gesture of withdrawal into absolute stillness</em>), until everything is back to normal again. Then everything is back to normal, the Lord's Presence is there again ... it's always there, but it can express and manifest itself ‚Äî while it can't get through that (<em>confusion</em>)! So I stay still and all goes well. And there, I can face any fresh disorders that come (provided they don't rush in too close on each other's heels!), but anyway, I pull through. To tell the truth, I always pull through, but there are disorders that shouldn't be, that are useless. I always feel like telling people, "Oh, I beg you, be quiet!..." But not the "quiet" of an apathetic quietude, not slumped in a corner and you don't move anymore (while anyway it keeps going like this inside (<em>gesture of seething</em>), no: quiet, quiet, like this (<em>vast gesture</em>) in the consciousness, then everything becomes limpid. And in that limpidity you see very clearly, decide very clearly, everything works out, things organize themselves, you don't even need to intervene.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-468">All difficulties... I see that, I've seen it lately with regard to political organizations, relations between nations and all that, all the problems to be solved ‚Äî it's all the same thing: people are like this (<em>same gesture of trepidation</em>), all the time, all the time, all the time ... one wave of restlessness, then another and yet another wave of restlessness coming on top of it ‚Äî and you don't see anything anymore! You can't see anything anymore! While if one can stay quiet for a while....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-469">It's the same with all the questions I am asked (I receive innumerable questions), it's all like this (<em>same gesture</em>), everything is like this and one can't see anything. If one remains quiet ... the Light goes through, everything becomes limpid, transparent, and ... it becomes so natural, so simple! So simple, so obvious: there is ONE thing that can be done and it's the true thing. All the rest ... (<em>same gesture of seething</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-470">Some people live in a constant whirl, and they're quite surprised that everything goes wrong! They meet with complications, with... And it's always that (<em>same gesture</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-471">Of course, I am not talking about those who are tamasic and completely inert: they are like an inert mass, so the Light can't go through ‚Äî it is the restlessness of others that goes through and stirs</p>

Everything, the entire universe moves forward rapidly at a fantastic pace and in perfect immobility. Words seem idiotic, but you can feel this ‚Äî you can feel it, see it, live it. A luminous immobility moving forward at a fantastic pace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-473">In that immobility there is perfect transparency ... and the problem does not exist: the solution precedes the problem. That is to say, things organize themselves (<em>gesture showing the movement of universal forces</em>) in such a way that they can change positions or take a different place in order to express the new thing that must be expressed: something new constantly enters the manifestation (as if emerging from the Un-manifest), it enters the manifestation and transforms. And it takes place automatically. A vast, immense Movement...

Of course, the general reason is very clear (it's easy to understand), but even from the point of view of the sadhana: that way, probably, nothing is overlooked.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-513">What's interesting is to follow this kind of change in the consciousness of the cells: there are still many of them with a sense of wonder that the Truth exists. That's the form it takes: a sense of wonder.... "Ah, so that's what it is!" A wonder. A wonder at the existence, the UNIQUE existence of the Lord ‚Äî a joy! Such an intense joy and a child-like wonder, you know: "Oh, so it's really like that!" And this goes on in one part of the body after another, one group of cells after another. Truly charming. And then, when the mantra comes spontaneously, oh!... There is an adoration: "It's like that, like that! That is true, it is THAT which is true ‚Äî all the disorder, all the ugliness, all the suffering, all the misery, all of that isn't true! It's not true, it is THAT which is true." And not with words (words trivialize it): with an extraordinary sensation, extraordinary! And then ... it's the beginning of that sort of glorious, marvellous life. It's still at the stage of wonder; that is, something unexpected in its sublimity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-514">At the same time, there is an overall vision which becomes more and more total, in which each thing has its own purpose, its own place, and which excludes nothing. That need to exclude the mind in order to surpass it no longer exists.

It receives a command, then it does something precise for a precise reason, a very precise action, and then ... silence and calm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-547">"... I must tell you once more that for us spiritual life does not mean contempt for Matter but its divinization. We do not want to reject the body but to transform it. For this, physical education is one of the means most directly effective ..."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-548">Last time, there was something I didn't have the time to tell you; now, regrettably, it's only a memory ‚Äî not quite, not just a memory, something remains. The effect remains. But while it was there ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-549">Sri Aurobindo said, but he said it as the expression of a knowledge that had always been expressed at the summit of the scale of consciousness, as one more rung beyond the state in which one knows (one knows it, lives it), that the essential Oneness, that everything is "That," is the expression or manifestation or objectification or ... of "That." Naturally, according to the times and epochs and milieus, it has been said in different words, but it seems to be the supreme experience. And the conclusion, when you go outside of time and space, is that all is from all eternity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-550">Sri Aurobindo regarded this (we talked about it), he regarded it as the realization (not just the knowledge: the realization) which gives supreme Peace and puts an end to all the whys and hows and all the wills to rectify things. All that, that whole drama of life, disappears when you realize that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-551">I have had this experience. I've had it in an almost constant way. And in the most conscious part of the being (that which is one with the heights), the expression of this experience, let's say, "All is from all eternity" or "All is the expression of the supreme Vision" (I am not using the word "will," I'll say why in a moment), there was the sense of a limitation. I don't know how to express it, but that's how it was (it goes without saying that all words are approximations). Always, each time the experience was there, it was there with the sense that... to put it crudely I might express it with the phrase, "That's not it!"</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 90</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-552">So the other day (the day before I saw you), it came at the time of my experiences, that is, very early morning (the time of my lived experiences), and it was like that, with that same sense of inadequacy. Then I entered a certain state in which "that" remained quite luminous and clear, but at the same time ‚Äî at the same time, simultaneously ‚Äî there came the perception ... (how can I put it?) of the original Vibration, as it were, in all the splendour of its all-powerful Light, and the two things ‚Äî that and That ‚Äî were simultaneously translated on the level of expression, without opposition, both together like this (<em>Mother clasps her two hands, interlacing her fingers</em>), tightly joined, in an identical Light: every instant ‚Äî every instant ‚Äî it's like a pulsation of that Force (it is: creative Force-Light-Power, contained in the global Vibration of Love); with every pulsation, a complete re-creation.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="29" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-553"></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-554">When the two things are like this (<em>same gesture</em>) and you live in that Consciousness, then there is a sense of absolute Freedom: that nothing is impossible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-555">It lasted for a few minutes perhaps, complete; then it began to be objectified, but at first it simply was... that IS, that IS. Afterwards it began being objectified, that is to say, to be a witness of That at the same time as one is that ‚Äî a slight descent. But at that moment, while it was there, it was THAT.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-556">It was omnipotence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-557">Absolute omnipotence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-558">Then, at the same time, at the same moment, there came the experience (not an objectified one), the experience that the Will is on a much lower level than "That," or rather, much more external. Because the Will sees and does ‚Äî sees AND does ‚Äî whereas there, it's not seeing AND executing AND doing, or seeing AND being: it's simultaneous. It's something above vision ‚Äî above vision and above will ‚Äî something ... (<em>silence</em>) something that IS. And at that moment, simultaneously, that is to say, without any possible space (space or time, of course, it's quite outside that, because it's not a vision that sees itself seeing, it's not a perception that's conscious of its perception, not a consciousness conscious of its consciousness), it IS, like that (one could say), such as it will be projected in space and time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-559">So when we say, "To want what God wants" or "To unite with the divine Will," it's our way of looking (<em>gesture from the bottom upwards, or from below to above</em>). And it's quite approximate. But there ... And the marvellous thing is that it's not what we in our infirmity may conceive of as a simplification, it's really ... the Whole: the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 91</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-560"> manifested, the non-manifested, the yet-to-be-manifested, everything, but everything ‚Äî the Whole. At that second, when you are there, it's omnipotence. Omnipotence, absolute freedom, the unforeseeable, and the existent whole. And that ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-561">Naturally, words are idiotic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-562">When I came back from That (it lasted long enough for me to have the full experience of it ‚Äî full, total), there were many things I then understood. One, for instance, which I had noticed with Sri Aurobindo for all the small details of life, well all things as they are on earth ‚Äî mere nothings; when I went to him with an inner vision and said to him, "This is how I see that" (I would say it to him with words or not), it would AUTOMATICALLY become true, it would become real: things that were neither in my hands nor in his nor ... And it wasn't that we would take a decision: it was automatic. I noticed this several times and found it wonderful.... It so happens that in a few psychological cases, that is, when it has to do with individual consciousness, since quite recently (it hasn't been like that very long), when someone is sincere (one must be sincere) and expresses an aspiration, for instance, a hope, or a vision of how he or she should be, I have seen this same phenomenon occur: it automatically becomes true.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-563">It's not very frequent yet, but it has happened. And now I understand how it happens.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-564">The day we are able to keep that state I was in the other day, wherein the will is already a secondary movement, then it will be like that: it's omnipotence. Because those two ideas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="30" href="#">2</a> that appear most contradictory are only as if two ways of looking at... the same thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-565">Naturally, when you try to bring that back into the consciousness that expresses itself, it becomes very difficult, but when you live it, while you live it, it's different.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-566">Now the experience has become a memory, but a memory that remains quite living and whose effect in the cells (<em>Mother touches the skin of her hands</em>) is making itself felt constantly. It is expressed here as a sense of a Freedom of choice. And a choice all-powerful in its execution. The impression that ... with life's every pulsation, the universe chooses ... what it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-567" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-568">It was followed by another peculiar experience.... Some people in Bombay have taken it into their heads to prepare a big event for 1968, when I turn ninety (supposedly ninety!). So they have prepared</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 92</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-569"> brochures which they are going to distribute to lots of people and so on ‚Äî I am quite indifferent to it, but they sent it to me for my approval. I stuck it in a corner and didn't bother about it. They returned to the charge, went and saw Nolini, said they were in a hurry because it's a big work and they needed to have it right away, so I shouldn't keep them waiting. So Nolini started reading out the brochure. And as he was reading ... (they included all that Sri Aurobindo said on the "universal Mother," the Mother's "Aspects" and all that, the whole old story ‚Äî generally it leaves me quite indifferent), but while he was reading, when he gave all the quotations and sentences, there was a kind of sensation (I don't know how to explain it), a sensation of imposed limitation, with a malaise, and something that wanted to break those limits. I didn't say anything. I said, "I don't want to concern myself with this, do what you like, it's no business of mine." And he answered along those lines, politely. But I found it very interesting, because that sense of malaise, of constriction ‚Äî limitation, constriction ‚Äî was very, very strong. So I said, "What's going on? What is it, why do I feel this way? What is it?..." As I said, usually I let myself float in an indifference, like that ‚Äî not "indifference," but... (<em>vast gesture</em>). Instead of that, it was as if someone wanted to shut me in something. Then I looked, and the memory of the experience [of the pulsations] came back, and I understood. It's interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-570">All this is felt in the body; all the experiences are in the body, in this ‚Äî which, besides ... I sometimes look (<em>laughing</em>), I look to see (I look from above), to see if there's still a form! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) ... It's peculiar. And why does it remain like this? ... Oh, I have stopped asking this question too. It's like that ... it's like that as the effect of a supreme Grace, because if it were otherwise ... it would be intolerable ‚Äî intolerable for everybody.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-571">Just the state of consciousness when I act spontaneously (the "I" is a habit of speech, it's to avoid having to make sentences), when I act spontaneously, without objectifying myself, it is generally fairly unbearable: the reactions in others are tiresome. I always have to [contain myself] ... It does happen, but generally I am obliged to be careful, especially when I have to speak.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-572">And there is a very amusing observation; it's exactly what Sri Aurobindo writes in <em>Savitri</em>: "The wise men talk and sleep ..." God grows up while the wise men talk and sleep.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="31" href="#">3</a> And that's how it is: wholly</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-575" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-576">When Nolini read me sentences from that brochure, at first when I felt that malaise, I wondered ... Because, as I have said several times, for the transformation to take place freely in this body, those very Entities and Powers and Beings were all keeping at a distance, they were no longer manifesting so as not to cause any mixture and so this (<em>body</em>) could be transformed. At first I thought, "That's what it is: I have lost (the body, I mean), has lost the habit of manifesting that (<em>the gods, the aspects of the Mother</em>), and so, when it comes into contact with that, there is a malaise." I thought it was that. And for a day (a whole day), it came back again and again, like a problem to be resolved. Then, suddenly, looking at it attentively, I saw it was the very opposite! I saw it was the sense of a constriction, of a limitation. Instead of it being an unbearable weight (<em>those gods or aspects of the Mother</em>), it was something preventing the free manifestation!... It seems so limited ‚Äî all those Entities, all those Powers, all those qualities, all those differences, all those attributes, all... oh! (<em>Mother makes a cramped gesture</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-577">There, that's what I wanted to tell you today.</p>

But it's here, the contact hasn't been abolished. Only, it's not the Manifestation.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-586">Mon petit, when the cells get into this state, it's wonderful, you can't imagine! It changes life com-plete-ly. They are like that: a sense of wonder at the first Contact. "Is it possible? Can it be that beautiful! Is it possible?" Like that. And constantly, all the time, at any moment, about anything: "Can it possibly be like that?" Such a sense of wonder! Then you see the difference with the old habits and everything people have had crammed into their heads (<em>renunciation, the beyond</em>) ‚Äî it's marvellous! Unbelievable. All morning again it was like that.... There comes a malaise (it always comes from outside, from this and that, in relation to this and that; that's how it comes), and immediately, they remember immediately. They remember, they say, "No! What You will, Lord." That's their attitude, an attitude of such complete self-giving! Much, much more complete, much simpler, much more charming than in any other part of the being. It's, "What You will.... You, You, You, what You will. To be... to be You not with an idea of aggrandizement, but to melt, to flow, to disappear in You like that." And then, "But You are reality!" And all these words are a diminution. Diminution not of sensation, but of consciousness ‚Äî it's a marvel of consciousness, you know: "You, You ... But You alone</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-587"> exist, You alone are." Then all the discomforts, all the pains, they vanish without a trace. It's a marvel, one can't imagine!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-588">Sri Aurobindo once wrote somewhere, after an experience like this of the Divine Presence in the being, he wrote, <em>"If men knew how marvellous is the way.... But they don't know."</em> He wrote it, I can't quote because I'll quote it incorrectly, but he had this experience, "If men knew how marvellous it is, they wouldn't hesitate for a minute."</p>

One should have this in order not to fling everything out of the window and just remain like that (<em>beatific gesture</em>), like an idiot doing nothing. It's thanks to that old discipline that everything I do is automatically done with a will for perfection. It's an old discipline.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-604">If they still need to oppose one thing to another (because that wretched mind doesn't work when it's not given an opposition), if they need an opposition, let them take the opposition between Truth and Falsehood, it's somewhat better (I am not saying it's perfect, but it's somewhat better). But then, in all things Falsehood and Truth are there, mixed, everywhere; in the so-called "spiritual life," in the sannyasins, the swamis, those who think they represent divine life on earth, all that, there is also that mixture of Falsehood and Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-605">It would be better not to make a split.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-606" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-607">For the children, precisely because they are children, the best would be to inculcate in them the will to conquer the future; the will to look ahead always and to move forward as rapidly as they can towards ... what will be. But not to drag along, like a millstone around their necks, the burden of a whole past weighing down on them. Only when you are already very high up in consciousness and knowledge is it good to look back in order to find the points wherein the future began to be outlined. When you can see the whole at a glance, when you have a very general vision, it's interesting to know that what will be realized ahead was already announced before; just</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-608"> as Sri Aurobindo said that "the divine life will manifest on earth because it is ALREADY buried in the depths of Matter." From this point of view it's interesting to look back or look at the very bottom (not in order to know what happened or to know what men have known ‚Äî that's quite useless).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-609">As for the child, he should be told, "There are marvels to be manifested, prepare yourself to receive them." Then, if they want something a little more concrete and easy to understand, they can be told, "Sri Aurobindo came to announce these things; when you are able to read him, you will understand." This awakens the interest and the desire to learn.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-610"><em>I do see the difficulty he alludes to: most people (in what we see written or in the conferences they have here), use pompous words ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-611">Yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-612"><em>...devoid of any truth of personal experience and without any effect. They rather have a negative effect. That's what he alludes to.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-613">Yes. But that's why it would be better to do as I said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-614">Oh, but not so long ago, the majority of the teachers were saying, "Ah, we must do this here because it's done everywhere." They have (<em>smiling</em>) already come a little way. But they still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-615">But above all, what is most important is to get rid of that division. And they all have it in their minds ‚Äî each and everyone of them! The division between living a spiritual life or living the ordinary life, having a spiritual consciousness or having an ordinary consciousness ‚Äî there is only ONE consciousness!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-616">In most people it's three-quarters asleep and distorted; in many it's still quite distorted. But what's necessary is not to leap from one consciousness to the other ‚Äî it is, quite simply, to open one's consciousness (<em>gesture upward</em>) and fill it with the vibrations of the Truth, putting it in harmony with what must be here (up there, it's from all eternity), but HERE, what must be HERE: the tomorrow of the earth. And if you weigh yourself down with a whole burden that you have to drag along ... if you drag behind you all that you should let go of, you won't be able to move forward very fast.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-617">Mind you, knowing things from the past of the earth can be very interesting and useful, but it must not be something that binds you</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 98</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-618"> or holds you back. If you use it as a springboard, it's all right. But in fact, it's rather secondary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-619">From the individual standpoint, there was a time (besides, it was fairly widespread in people who dealt with so-called occult things) when it seemed thrilling to know one's past lives, one's past experiences; but as soon as I came here and I understood the change that Sri Aurobindo had brought about, I found all that absolutely immaterial. It's childish curiosity. It doesn't help you in any way, it's merely either to glory in it or for fun, but it's unimportant. Some people still write to me, "Will you please tell me what my past lives were?" I answer them, "It's not interesting. What's interesting is the life you want to realize, not the errors you made in the past!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-620" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-621">It would be interesting to formulate or work out a new method of teaching for the children, taking them very young. Very young, it's easy. We need people (oh, we would need remarkable teachers) who have, first of all, sufficient documentation on what is known to be able to answer any question; and at the same time, at least the knowledge, if not the experience (the experience would be better) of the true intuitive intellectual attitude, and ... (naturally, the capacity would be still preferable) but in any case the knowledge that the true way to know is mental silence: an attentive silence turned towards the truer Consciousness, and the capacity to receive what comes from there. The best would be to have that capacity; in any case, it should be explained that it's the true thing, a kind of demonstration, and that it works not only with regard to what must be learned, the whole field of knowledge, but also with regard to the whole field of what must be done: the capacity to receive the exact indication of HOW to do it, and as one progresses, it turns into a very clear perception of what must be done, and the precise indication of WHEN it must be done. At the very least, as soon as the children have the capacity to reflect (it begins at seven, but around fourteen or fifteen it's very clear), they should be given some first hints at the age of seven, and a complete explanation at fourteen, of how to do it and that it's the sole means of being in contact with the deeper truth of things; that all the rest is a more or less clumsy mental approximation of something you can know directly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-622">The conclusion is that the teachers themselves should have at least a sincere beginning of discipline and experience: it is not a question of piling up books and of repeating them like that. That's not the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 99</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-623"> way to be a teacher ‚Äî the whole earth is like that, let it be like that outside if it makes them happy! As for us, we aren't propagandists, we simply want to show what can be done and try to prove that it MUST be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-624">When you begin with very small children, it's wonderful! With them, there's so little you have to do: it suffices TO BE.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-625">Never make a mistake.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-626">Never get angry.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-627">Always understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-628">Understand and see clearly why this movement took place, why that impulse, what the child's inner constitution is, which point needs to be strengthened and brought to the fore. That's all you have to do, and then leave them: leave them free to blossom, just give them the opportunity to see many things, touch many things, do as many things as possible. It's great fun. And above all, do not try to impose on them something you think you know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-629">Never scold, always understand, and, if the child is capable, explain. If he isn't capable of understanding an explanation (if you are yourself capable of it), replace the false vibration by a true one. But that... that's asking of the teachers a perfection they rarely have.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-630">But it would be very interesting to draw up a program for the teachers, and the real program for study, starting with the very small ones ‚Äî they are so plastic and anything leaves such a deep stamp on them! If they were given a few drops of truth when they are very small, they would blossom out quite naturally as their being grows.</p>

But at present she is splashing and floundering in the muddle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-639">Sri Aurobindo has shown that the truth does not lie in running away from earthly life but in remaining in it, to <em>transform it, divinize it</em>, so that the Divine can manifest HERE, in this PHYSICAL WORLD.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Satprem complains as usual about his totally unconscious nights</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-651">There has been for some time a deliberate will not to leave the body. In the mornings, when I emerged from my nocturnal activities, I would often notice that there was a whole work of readjustment to be done in the body, as though the concentration of forces had been disturbed and even undone in the night and everything had to be started up again. It was a sheer waste of time, a waste. Previously, in the evening when I would lay down on my bed, I would go limp, a complete relaxation (one should always do that), that is, <em>surrender</em>, and the consciousness would rise above. There was a concentration of forces, but it wouldn't last: after two or three hours, everything was taken up by the night's activities. But now, instead of that, there is a will to keep the whole consciousness in the body, to concentrate and to keep all the energies so that the work in the cells may go on undisturbed. And I see the effect lasts much longer; even when I wake up (or rather when I get into external activity), I can see it goes on, it doesn't cease, and it resumes as soon as I am outwardly awake. A sort of concentration of energy, of consciousness, force, light, which starts working in the cells at night. And then there's nothing, no activity, there's a contemplative silence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-652">I had only one instance of activity these last four days, one morning between two and four, that I spent absolutely conscious and active with Sri Aurobindo, who had made "changes" in his activities and his organization of the subtle physical; he had made changes and wanted to show them to me, to let me know about them. And he showed it</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-657">It seems the man who discovered it did so by accident (that's always how it happens): he took a dose without knowing it and without knowing what it was, and the effects on him were extraordinary. (It was in Switzerland, a doctor, I believe, or a chemist, I don't know.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="34" href="#">2</a>) And now, for the first time after years (the discovery took place years ago), for the first time he has consented to give a description of his experiences. Naturally, Y. enthused over it, she prepared a report and sent it to me.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-658">As you know, I am very busy. I didn't have time to read these papers, but I know too that Y. is rather impatient(!), and these last three or four days I had been saying to myself, "I must ABSOLUTELY see that, otherwise it won't do. I MUST see that ..." And it kept coming back. Then one morning (in the morning, at the time when I have all my experiences), while I was sitting, I suddenly felt something so heavy in my head, heavy in my chest, and ... odd. I had never felt that before. And all the sensations had become almost violent. So I closed my eyes, and... you know, an avalanche, a cavalcade of forms, sounds, colours, even odours, which imposed themselves with a reality and intensity ‚Äî I had never known that before, never.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-659">I watched, then I said to myself, "But that's a good way to go mad!" And I started doing what had to be done for it to stop. But it wouldn't stop! It wanted to go on. So I thought, "It's obviously here for a reason. Since it's imposing itself in this way, it means there's a reason for me to have this experience." I watched, studied, observed. And I saw it was a magnified faculty of sensation ‚Äî inordinately magnified, you understand ‚Äî BECAUSE the equilibrium between all the faculties of the being had been disrupted.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-660">The natural equilibrium which makes things balance each other, harmonize and organize spontaneously into a coherent whole with a conscious existence, was shattered ‚Äî shattered to the benefit of the faculty of sensation. And naturally, that faculty of sensation was terribly multiplied (or aggravated, one could say) and even imposed itself brutally. And I saw that something had upset the equilibrium. Something that had the power to upset the equilibrium of the being ‚Äî to insist on one point to the detriment of all others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-661">Once I had seen that, a sort of tranquillity came into me and it was over.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-662">I didn't give it any more thought. For three days I didn't think about it again. It seemed to me to be some extravagance or other. Yesterday evening, I decided I would read those papers. I asked Pavitra to read them to me. The man describes his experiences ‚Äî the first description is just what happened to me!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-663">So I had the experience he had when he took the medicine!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-664">He describes it (I couldn't read it all), he describes it exactly as I had felt it. So (<em>laughing</em>) I had the experience without swallowing the medicine! Simply because the consciousness was turned to that.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="35" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-665">But then, I understood! And those people imagine it's a way to "develop human consciousness" and open up "unknown horizons".... The effect (now I am absolutely sure of it) is the dislocation of the being's equilibrium.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-666">To me, it's very sensitive, because the equilibrium is very conscious, very willed, very organized, and naturally that makes a considerable difference; for them (<em>laughing</em>) it's just like that, a fantasy. And then, they are convinced (Y. included) that humanity can make great progress with that! It makes them "conscious of a whole realm they didn't know." But... it creates one more falsehood in the consciousness, because the perception of ONE aspect of reality to the detriment of all others is a dreadful falsehood. As I said, the impression it made on me was: It's a good way to go mad.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-667">To them it's accidental, because they take the medicine and think, "When I will stop taking the medicine, naturally it won't happen again" ‚Äî but that's not true! It can give the being the habit of disorder, the habit of imbalance.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-670">I haven't read the whole thing, only half of it, I am going to read the other half. But according to what they say there, now it's, oh, tremendously widespread!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-671">Now, we may ask if it's necessary for mankind to fall into general imbalance in order to reach a higher equilibrium?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-672">But it's perfectly clear that one doesn't need drugs in order to have experiences ‚Äî I didn't take drugs!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-673">That's what they think, they think it gives them a certainty that it (<em>the other worlds</em>) isn't imagination, or, for the more reasonable ones, that there are many more things than they can know or can imagine.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-682"><em>But do you still hold the same opinion after reading to the end? Because you hadn't read the whole thing.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-683">That it upsets the being's equilibrium there is absolutely no doubt. And of course, upsetting one's equilibrium may lead you to a higher equilibrium. But there is a risk.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-684" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-685">It's probably part of the preparations. The only thing is, the results can be fairly catastrophic.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-686">It could be part of a scientific discipline. But then, that's how it should be done, as a discipline, and under the supervision of those who know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-687">You see, he takes great care not to say anything about the harmful effects. I have personally met two people who had done the experiment and had met with dreadful effects ‚Äî they decided never to touch it again in their lives.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-688">They are very careful not to say anything about that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-689">It should be done as an educational discipline, with all the necessary safeguards and supervision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-690">It's the same as all the rest: it's the method that starts from below. The true method starts from above ‚Äî it's more difficult, less spectacular, and it takes more time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-691">From the standpoint of study and observation, it's very interesting. But it should be done scientifically, in a spirit of discipline and almost consecration, as a means of study.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-692">Of course, just the contact with a small amount of the Force from above disturbs many people's minds; so here, I think the effect would be very general.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-693">It's a risk to be run.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-694">If someone ‚Äî someone conscious, who already knows much, who is very much master of himself and has control over his reactions ‚Äî does it as a means of study, it can be very interesting. But giving it to a poor devil who knows nothing and goes headlong into it out of curiosity can be disastrous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-695" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 106</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-696">In the last part, what he calls the "cellular level" is indeed the description ‚Äî ONE description ‚Äî of cellular phenomena and activities on their level of consciousness, and also on the level of consciousness of the infinitesimal. He speaks of "great currents" and "cellular transformations" and all that; it's quite correct, only....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="36" href="#">1</a> It's what is going on at present, but it's just the consciousness reduced to the dimension of the infinitesimal. And it's a reproduction of what takes place in the other dimensions. But, for example, after all this discipline of the cells that there has been for... several years now, his description strikes me as the same thing SEEN THROUGH AN ILLUSION. And the illusion is caused by that very imbalance: the illusion of an absolute reality, while it's a quite relative reality. You understand, it's the difference between seeing something with a sense of relativity, with a whole immensity of other things, and seeing it all alone as an exclusive and unique reality. It's the sense of the harmony and balance of the Whole that is gone. And so, it becomes "dreadful": as he says, some people may find it frightening. And that's precisely because that equilibrium is missing. It's the same thing in a smaller version in an individual: that vision of the whole which gives the proportion of every event, the importance of every event and every thing, changes completely when you have the sense of the Whole, and what appears frightening or catastrophic or marvellous becomes again just a part of the Whole. It's the sense of equilibrium that is gone. When I read the end, it gave me one more confirmation of my experience.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-697">It may be necessary, in certain cases, to disrupt that equilibrium so as to come into contact with something new, but that's always dangerous. And the way of consecration and <em>surrender</em> to the supreme Power is infinitely superior ‚Äî it's slightly more difficult. It's more difficult than swallowing a drug, but infinitely superior.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 107</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-698">We could call it "yoga within everyone's reach"! But... it's not without danger.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-701">That the Force is working is without a shadow of doubt, and that this is the result of the action of the Force is also without a shadow of doubt.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-702">There are other, very interesting examples. There's a Burmese (you may have heard of this) who has just received a "peace prize." He has written an article (he is Burmese, I don't know which language he wrote it in, but it has been published in French in a Swiss newspaper), in which he says what everybody knows, but what everybody forgets too: that if all the money wasted on preparing means of destruction were used for the progress of human well-being, we could work wonders. And he adds (I can't quote him exactly): for that to be possible, men ‚Äî nations and men ‚Äî must stop distrusting and fearing each other, and live in the sense of unity. And he says, if, for that, HUMAN NATURE HAS TO CHANGE, it's high time it changed and we must all work for that to happen.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-703">I am extremely happy to hear this. Here is a man who has caught the true thing.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="37" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-704">And it's beginning to spread. In Korea, too, there is someone who says the same thing and who is known to thousands of people. They are all asking for the change in [human] nature, a "new consciousness."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-705" style="text-align: right;">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-706">There is something interesting in this cellular consciousness: they have a sense of sincerity which is MUCH sharper, and what they call in English <em>exacting</em>, than in the vital and the mind (even the material</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 108</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-707"> vital and mind). There is a sort of absoluteness in the sincerity which is very remarkable, and they have a rigorousness between them which is quite wonderful. It's extremely interesting. If anything, any part, any movement, tries to cheat, they catch it like this (<em>gesture of nipping it and wringing its neck</em>), and in such a sharp and precise way.... In all the vital or mental movements, there is always a kind of (<em>sinuous gesture</em>) suppleness, something that tries to adapt ‚Äî while here, oh... it's like this (<em>inflexible gesture</em>). So when there is invocation, prayer, self-giving, surrender, trust, all those things become so pure ‚Äî so pure, so crystalline, you know, that... oh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-708">And precisely, there is a growing conviction that a perfection realized in Matter is a perfection that is FAR MORE perfect than anywhere else. That's what gives it a stability it has nowhere else.... If there is something somewhere (when there is a great offering and then a joyous self-giving, joyous surrender), if there is something that comes in with even the slightest self-interest ‚Äî for instance, a suffering in some little corner (a pain or disorder), which hopes for or wishes or expects some improvement ‚Äî then it gets caught like this (<em>same gesture of nipping and wringing its neck</em>) and it's told, "Oh, insincere one! Give yourself unconditionally." Then it's magnificent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-709">It's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-710">And this joy, this enthusiasm at the possibility: that being wholly sincere is POSSIBLE; almost, I could say, that it is permitted (these are words): "Life is such a disorder and muddle of insincerity that THAT is really what is expected of us, THAT; THAT is what's permitted, THAT is what must be realized: to be absolute in the joy of self-giving." It's a marvel, a marvel!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-711">Also, the contact with all those beings of the Overmind, all those gods, all those Entities, all those divinities.... There is here, in the cells, a sort of... (what can I call it?) rectitude, and, yes, sincerity and honesty that says, "Oh, what fuss they make! How all this is (<em>Mother puffs up her cheeks</em>) puff! puff! swollen up." It's very interesting, really very interesting. The vision of the world is quite different. It's far more honest ‚Äî far more honest, far more sincere, far more upright. It's strange.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-712">The consciousness expressed in transformed cells is a marvel. It justifies all those ages of misery. To reach that was really worth the trouble. Really worth it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-713">Especially all pretence, all exaggeration, all vanity, oh, it's all looked at as through the ingenuous eyes of a very pure child (it's much better than that! The comparison is invidious).</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 109</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-714" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-715">Then there is a sort of internal code of regulations. When there is a pain somewhere, something that goes awry, you should see the others' attitude!... A seriousness that first says (I have to translate, and it loses all its charm), but first it begins with, "Don't you make such a fuss and to-do" (or "don't you all," it depends). Then, a pressure to surrender. And that action to make the Light circulate everywhere.... I am interpreting; with interpretation, the mind always mixes in, unfortunately. The thing itself isn't thought ‚Äî it isn't thought, it doesn't watch itself be, it's very spontaneous. Very spontaneous and thus very sincere. It's pretty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-716">It's like an immense society, you understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-717">And during the work there are ... (what should I call them?) conglomerations, or very small groups of cells that have retained imprints, imprints made on them. Or sometimes here (<em>gesture to the brain</em>), but there it's full of a great light like that, compact; all the same there are corners ‚Äî many dark nooks and crannies ‚Äî and then unfolds all of a sudden, the memory of the circumstances, events, sensations, perceptions that built that (<em>the imprint</em>), all seen in the new Light, and to be eliminated. And then ... yes, as they<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="38" href="#">3</a> say, you "trip," you travel in an immense world, indeed; and it's not things from the past, it's ... an immense Present in which you travel.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-718">Only, you travel consciously and voluntarily, instead of through the effect of a drug. That's superior.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-719">This morning again, the lesson was repeated with, for instance, bits of old things still clinging, reactions, small movements (inner movements): "Only one solution, one single solution: self-annulment, perfect self-giving, the <em>surrender</em> of everything."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-720">Then there's the joy of Light ‚Äî the beauty, the joy ... a splendour!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-721" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-722">It's the only remedy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-723">Naturally, everything is good, everything is possible (<em>L.S.D.</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="39" href="#">4</a> ), but... it seems to be a very circuitous route to arrive at the same place.</p>

LSD reveals cellular dialogues imperceptible to the normal state of consciousness, for which we have no adequate symbolic terms. You become aware of processes you never sensed before. You feel yourself sinking into the soft swamps of your own body's tissues, slowly drifting below dark red aqueducts, floating through endless capillary factories, gently propelled through endless factories of cells, grandfather clocks of fibers tirelessly jingling, clinking, tinkling, pumping. This experience is striking when you have it for the first time; it can also be a dreadful, frightening and at the same time marvelous experience....‚Äù Then his description of the ‚Äúprecellular level‚Äù: ‚ÄúYour nervous cells become aware, as Einstein did, that all matter, ail structure is nothing but pulsating energy. Your body and the world around you dissolve into a sparkling lattice of white waves. You have penetrated matter's intimate structure and vibrate in harmony with its primeval and cosmic pulse.‚Äù</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-724">Yesterday evening, I received a big file from Y. on "prenatal education".... She says that during the first months of its life, the child needs to touch its mother's skin, and that this (<em>Mother shows the photo of a naked Negress carrying her naked child on her back</em>) is the ideal way to carry children!?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-725">I read it yesterday, because she had spoken so much of this prenatal education, saying the child is fully educated by the age of three, so I wanted to know what she proposed. But there isn't a single thing in it, she doesn't say what should be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-726"><em>Just at the last page.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-730">A child to whom you must never say, "Come".... That's not easy in the language if you can't tell him, "Come"!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-731"><em>No one ever tells him, "You must."</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-733">Where is she going to find parents to do that!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-734"><em>Yes, it's the parents who should be educated!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-735">Yes, to begin with.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-736">Just in this last page there is a hint of what that education might be, but it's the negative side, what must not be. That's all. But the positive side isn't there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-737">She had already spoken to me once about prenatal education, so I thought it must have some meaning, but here ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-738">Of course, we know from experience you can give the form that you imagine; in the broad lines, you can give the character you imagine; all that is quite correct. So to begin with, it's the mother who should be educated, not the child. Then, through a very strict control of your own reactions, you can prevent certain wrong impulses from mixing into the child's making. But all that isn't new, it's been known for a long time since it's what I practiced when I was expecting a child. So I know it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-739">But once again, it's the mother who must be educated, before she has a child, that's what matters.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-740">As for me, I understood that you could already give the child ideas, aspirations, tendencies (I didn't know how that was possible), but she doesn't say anything leading to that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-741">There's only one thing, she says somewhere that during the first few weeks, for the child the separation is painful, and so the physical contact is necessary ‚Äî the touch ‚Äî the contact with the skin to give the child the taste of life and the understanding of physical life.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="40" href="#">1</a> That's possible. But nowadays doctors say, "The last thing you should do is touch your child ‚Äî put it in a cradle. You should not touch it because that will deform it." It runs quite counter to her theories. Of course,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 112</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-742"> she may be right to a certain extent, it's possible. But anyway, it's a very small detail, it's nothing. I expected a lot and have been somewhat disappointed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-743">But what this Burmese man has said is fine ‚Äî that's much more interesting: this idea that it's high time human nature changed. That's good. Because in ordinary life, ordinary people tell you, "I can't help it, that's the way I am!" It's the answer you always get.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-744" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-745">To do things properly, we would need a small "educational booklet" for the children of the future. A "preconceptional booklet" to prepare the father and mother (especially the mother, that's the most important). Then a booklet for the first three years of life: the qualities required, the attitude to be taken.... At any rate, the father and mother should first know the possibility (at least the possibility) of a child being more than a mere animal man.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-746">Then, conception should take place entirely outside of desire. That's another very difficult condition to be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-747">And the mother, throughout the gestation, should be in an atmosphere absolutely protected from all degrading influences: an ideally beautiful place, a wonderful climate where everything is harmonious, and a wholly spontaneous, free and harmonious and beautiful life sheltered from all vulgarities of life. And the mother herself should have the ideal of the new child. It should be done not as a mechanical but as a conscious, willed thing in an absolutely "creative" atmosphere, we might say.</p>

The least separation may cause an irreparable trauma, that ‚Äòfall on the head‚Äô which is the usual but abnormal condition of the newborn in civilized peoples. This is well-known to primitive peoples, where the mother keeps the naked child on her naked skin and never parts with it.... Until the other senses are specialized, it is chiefly through the surface of the skin that the child receives its education.... If one wants it to incarnate really, to be friends with matter, its body to become as intimate as its soul, one must invent for it a yoga of caresses and play.‚Äù (It is worth noting that an attempt to put these alluring and specious theories into practice was to have catastrophic results, as we shall see later in the <em>Agenda</em>: the main effect of the said ‚Äúcaresses‚Äù is to attract into the child's body vital forces of a dark order, and ‚Äúgenii of sex‚Äù rather than anything else are likely to be incarnated.)</p>

("From above" is a manner of speaking, because if you think about it, it may also be from the depths: there's no sense of direction, no high or low or anything of the sort.) But it's no longer leaning on the surface for support ‚Äî for standing, walking, sitting, for making movements....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-764">There is also the pressure of external agitation (the world lives in perpetual agitation), the external agitation: everything and everyone is rushing towards ... one really doesn't know why. They want to do ten times more things in a given space of time than is normally possible, so it goes like this (<em>gesture of trepidation</em>). And to have the strength to remain calm and well-balanced in the middle of it, in that whirl ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-765">It's very interesting, really.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-766">What people generally call "force" (in the English sense of the word <em>strength</em>) is something very heavy and tamasic. True force is a tremendously rapid movement, but ... in perfect calm. There is no agitation; the movement is fantastically faster, but without agitation,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 115</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-767"> in such calm!... They generally don't even feel that Force, yet it is the one that makes ‚Äî that will make ‚Äî the transformation possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-768">The difficulty is always the transition. You see, the body acts (it is carried, so to speak: things are done without the sense of resistance or fatigue, nothing of the sort, that doesn't exist), and then, if for some reason or other (generally an influence or a thought coming from someone else), if the memory of the other method (the ordinary method, the universal method of all human beings) comes all of a sudden, it is as if ... (it's very strange) it is as if the body could no longer DO ANYTHING, absolutely as if it were about to faint. Then, there immediately comes the reaction, and the other movement gets the upper hand again. But that makes for a difficult time. When these lapses will become impossible, there will be security. But as it is now, it's difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-769">Only, now (formerly there was a moment when it was dangerous), now there is immediately in the cells that movement of adoration, which calls, "You, You, You ..." Then it's all right.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Regarding the "darshan" of April 24, the forty-seventh anniversary of Mother's coming to Pondicherry.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-773">How was the 24th? Did you stay at home for the meditation?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-774"><em>No, I always come.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-775">It was rather peculiar.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-776">Here is the sequence of events: someone living here had a very bad cold some seven or eight days before the darshan. I said to myself, "I must not catch it"(<em>in fact, Mother has a bad cold</em>). So I did a special prayer not to catch it. But it has had consequences.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-777">I told you about that experience (which has been growing increasingly concrete and constant) of the Vibration of Harmony (a higher harmony expressing the essential Consciousness in its aspect of love and harmony and, as it draws nearer to the manifestation, of order and organization), and of the nearly constant and general vibration of disorder, disharmony, conflict ‚Äî in reality, Matter's resistance to this Action. The two vibrations are like this (<em>Mother slips the fingers of her right hand between those of the left</em>), as if they interpenetrated each other and a simple movement of consciousness sent you to one side or the other, or rather, the aspiration, the will for realization, put you into contact with the Vibration of Harmony, and the SLIGHTEST slackening made you lapse into the other. It has become constant. And then, on the 24th, right from morning there was a constant aspiration, a constant will for the triumph of the Vibration of Harmony. Then I sat down at my table as I always do, about five or</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 117</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-778"> ten minutes before it began. And instantly, with a puissance ‚Äî a puissance capable of crushing an elephant ‚Äî this Vibration of Harmony came down like that, massive ... to the point that the body lost the sense of its existence altogether: it became That, it was conscious of nothing but That. And the first quarter of an hour literally flashed by in a second. Then, there were three people in the room; one of the three, or maybe all three, felt a malaise (nothing surprising!), and that woke me up: I saw the light (I burn a candle on my table) and I saw the time, but it wasn't me ‚Äî something saw. Then there was a sort of pacifying action on the place, and then ‚Äî gone again. And one second later, the call of the end!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="44" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-779">It's the first time that has happened to my body. It always used to remain conscious. Sri Aurobindo, too, told me the same thing, that he never, ever, had samadhi in his body. Neither did I: I always, always, always used to remain conscious. While that... only the Force remained, there was nothing left but the Force at work: there was a concentration here, a concentration on the whole country, and a concentration on the whole earth. And all that was conscious, like that (<em>vast gesture above the head</em>), at work. But something massive, as powerful as an elephant ‚Äî enough to crush you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-780">I didn't say anything to anyone; I wanted to know (because when I speak, people try to find something, while I wanted to know the spontaneous reaction). The first thing I received was a letter from G. saying that he was at the Samadhi, and just before it began, a force came down on him so strongly that he fell (he was sitting, he fell forward). So he asked me what it was. I haven't replied yet. Then there have been other people, other things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-781">To me, that was unique, because it's the first time it has happened to me. But it has had a result: all that still clings, within, to that old habit of disorder and disharmony ‚Äî which is the cause of, oh, everything, all mischief, all illnesses, everything ‚Äî that has been ... Yesterday afternoon, I saw there was something that needed to be eliminated, and it changed into a head cold. It's nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-782">It's nothing, and it has given me an opportunity to see that all the cells everywhere, even those that according to the old habit should be in discomfort because of the cold, are all in a blissful aspiration of transformation. And they truly and spontaneously feel that what's happening to them is for it all to move a little faster. So they are very happy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-783">But things should move still faster; that is, all these things such as colds and so on, should pass off very quickly ‚Äî come in and go out.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-784">There are still many bad habits ‚Äî that will pass.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-785">And there was the consciousness ‚Äî the Total Consciousness, in a light ... a light without any equivalent here, yet it was quite material. If you like, it was like molten gold ‚Äî molten and luminous. It was very thick. And it had a power ‚Äî a weight, you know, like that, it was astonishing. And then, no more body, nothing anymore ‚Äî nothing anymore, nothing but That. And the vision of That, like this (<em>gesture widening out above the head</em>), in its immediate action, its action on the country, and its action on the whole earth. An action that doesn't cause any movement, I don't know how to explain it. A sort of pressure ‚Äî a pressure in which nothing is displaced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-786">The pressure went away after the meditation, but the effect has remained, and when, out of the old habit, I got up afterwards to take something on the table over there, I nearly fell! The body no longer knew how to walk! I had to concentrate, then it came back.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-787">Something still remained (but not as strong as that), something remained when I went to the balcony (<em>in the afternoon of the 24th</em>). At the balcony I was different from what I usually am. I don't exactly know what it was. But then, the photographs are very different; there is something in the photographs that isn't there usually. There was a special atmosphere.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-789">I remembered something Sri Aurobindo told me sometime during the last months; he told me, "When the supramental Force" (which he was constantly calling down, of course), "when the supramental Force is there and for as long as it is present, you get a sense of all-powerfulness ‚Äî an unconditioned all-powerfulness: an ALL-powerfulness." But he said, "<em>It goes in the background</em>" when the pressure of the Force goes.</p>

The day before there were less, maybe forty-five), and there was a little child, less than a year old, carried by his father. He was sleepy, leaning on his father's shoulder, like that. The father came in; when he came near me, the child saw me ‚Äî he opened his eyes, a man's eyes! It wasn't a child anymore, you understand. Then he looked at me. He had a blissful smile and ... held his hand out to me! He caught hold of my hand, I gave him my hand ‚Äî how happy he was! But the father wanted to do <em>pranam</em> [prostration], so he put him down. There was a large tray beside me with about fifty of these small books (which contain all the quotations of the passages in which Sri Aurobindo spoke of God). The child looked; he took a book, looked at it, fingered it, tried to open it ‚Äî without a word, nothing. Naturally, the parents, who think they are very wise, the father who thinks he is a wise man, said, "We can't leave this book in the child's hands," and he took it to put it back in its place ‚Äî the child howled! Then C. took the book and gave it to the little one, and while the others did pranam (there were a dozen people), all the while he kept looking at the golden letters, feeling them....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-802">He is certainly one of the most remarkable, but not the only one. All the children less than a year old who are brought to me are like that (more or less). This one is very, very conscious. Such eyes, you know ‚Äî fully conscious eyes.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-807">Pavitra has been filing old letters, and so ... I told you, didn't I, that since the 24th there is a CONSTANT insistence, every minute, to give full support to the Harmony and not to allow disorder, disharmony and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 124</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-808"> confusion to manifest ‚Äî from the physical, vital and mental points of view. Like that, like someone pounding something, since the 24th (I told you the other day about the Force that came; it's been like that since then). And yesterday or the day before, Pavitra, while sorting out those letters, came across something I had written to someone in English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-809">"Yes, the good-will hidden in all things reveals itself everywhere to that one who carries goodwill in his consciousness.<br/>
"This is a constructive way of feeling leading straight to the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-810">I found this very interesting (it was written years ago, in any case more than a year ago, and Pavitra told me he hadn't even found it in a letter: it was there among the files). And it was as if to tell me, "See, you were already speaking like this before." Because the "goodwill" is the Harmony (psychological, of course), it's the will for everything to go well psychologically. I found this rather interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-811">And it's good it came back; it's a form quite within everyone's grasp, which they can understand ‚Äî you aren't asked extraordinary things: you are asked goodwill. When I found this again, I smiled and found it amusing, I said, "Well, I could have written the same thing about cheerfulness! I could have said, 'Be cheerful and you will see cheerfulness everywhere.'" ‚Äî One can say many things (<em>Mother rotates her hand slowly as if to present various facets</em>), it always makes me think of a kaleidoscope with colour arrangements to express something else which ... shrinks, becomes diminished, generalized and finally within everyone's grasp. But there is something: like a FORMIDABLE conflict taking place over the earth at this moment, with this wonderful divine Grace always helping, always striving for the best and exerting a pressure, "Come now, be cheerful, come now, have goodwill, come now, have, yes, have that inner Harmony of contentment, of hope, of faith. Do not accept the vibrations of ... decomposition ‚Äî the vibrations that diminish, degrade and lead towards destruction."</p>

I can no longer eat, I can hardly rest anymore, I see literally hundreds of people and things and papers and ... This poor body could say, "Phew!" ‚Äî but not at all. And if the tension in others at any given time happens to cause a slight loss of balance, the body spontaneously says like this: "Oh, but You, You are there" ‚Äî and it's all over.

You see images, you see thoughts, you see ... There is a vital vision: you just have to close your eyes to see all sorts of things. It's not always pretty. It's the kind of dreams you have. You will have had dreams of that kind which weren't very pleasant. And then, for (how long?) twenty, thirty years (I started seeing when I was quite small ‚Äî I didn't know what it was) but when I began to know what it was, I complained a lot that I didn't have perfectly objective visions (<em>Mother gestures in front of her open eyes</em>): not those one sees here around the head; not those one sees when one is in the vital; but those one sees like this, with open eyes. And when I met quite ordinary mediums, people who saw with open eyes, I used to say, "Those people are great!" When I met Sri Aurobindo, I told him. Naturally he made fun of me ‚Äî he was right. So I took no more interest in it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-838">Then, quite recently, when I began doing the yoga in the cells, lo and behold, they started seeing! But then ... what a caravanserai! And it kept going and coming, and seeing and seeing, constantly, all the time. I would open my eyes: instead of seeing material things, I would see the physical things behind them. Oh! Then I said, "I understand!... It was the aspiration of Ignorance, now I understand: people who don't see are blessed!" Because I always used to say, "My visions aren't concrete, they are subjective visions since they are inner visions; they are subjective visions, not concrete ones ‚Äî I want concrete visions, I want to see the material world as it is; not in its deceptive appearance ‚Äî AS IT IS." When I started seeing, I said, "No thanks! We are blessed not to see."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-839"><em>But that's not what I am asking.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-840">No, I know that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-841"><em>I want to see the Light.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-842">Yes, you want to see the Light. But you see it!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 129</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-843"><em>No, I don't!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-844">Ah, mon petit, I know you do, because since the very first time you told me, "I want to see," I assure you in all honesty that I said, "But why doesn't he see? He should see." Then, the first time I met Sri Aurobindo (that is, immediately afterwards), I said to him, "Satprem wants to see." He answered me, "He sees, but without knowing it. But he sees."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-845">So I thought there may be ... You know, sometimes there's a very small <em>gap</em> (we have many layers of consciousness that interpenetrate like that), if there is just a <em>gap</em>, a lacuna, a void between the two, it is enough to not know. That's what Th√©on explained to me: "All your states of being are there in the fourth dimension, one inside the other; what you lack is a very small level." It's nothing, you know, in your consciousness you don't notice it, but in its construction something is undeveloped, and so what's on the other side can't come through; it's lost between this and that. It's lost. So I asked him, "What can be done?" He told me, "You must develop it." And I did the experiment (he told me and I did it). And indeed I had a "nervous subdegree" (he used to call the "vital" the "nervous"), a nervous subdegree that wasn't developed, not sufficiently conscious. And for a year, day after day after day, a concentration to develop it, applying the consciousness, applying the consciousness ... ‚Äî absolutely no result. For at least ‚Äî at least ‚Äî six months continuously, a concentration every day; I kept an hour for that ‚Äî absolutely no result.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-846">Only, I didn't doubt. I simply thought, "How very stupid of me, I don't know how to do it ..." I was living in Paris; come summer, I left on holidays. I went to some friends' who had a property by the sea. There was a small wood, large meadows, it was pretty. And after lunch, I go and lie down on the grass ... and all of a sudden, everything ‚Äî from the air, the earth, the water, from everywhere ‚Äî everything came. Everything, but everything I wanted to have came like that. Suddenly. Like that, effortlessly. The result of six months of work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-847"><em>But I very often feel the lack of Nature here.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-848">You feel it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-849"><em>Yes, a lot. I miss it a lot.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-850">Yes. My feeling... (because I've studied your problem a good deal ‚Äî I seem as if I couldn't care less, but that's not true! I've studied</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 130</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-851"> your problem a great deal), my feeling is that in your higher mind, the faculty of expression is developed ‚Äî highly developed ‚Äî so that as soon as the Light touches, it is transformed into ideas, words, concepts, like that. It DOESN'T HAVE THE TIME to be visualized. It's not outwardly, but right up above that it is (how can I put it?) particularly and exceptionally active and expressive (something quite rare, because generally, in everyone, it's nebulous up above). And because it has developed in that way (which is a higher condition), you are lacking the primary condition which is the vision, the shock of the Light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-852">So there is only one solution. To me, there is a solution: it's the sudden contact with a HIGHER light in the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo said (that's obvious, it's always like that) that there are several <em>layers</em> (it's not quite like "layers", but never mind), several layers of supramental light. The first (the one that has manifested), that one you immediately transformed into conceptions, ideas and words. That is, something a large number of intellectuals are praying and imploring to have ‚Äî you had it spontaneously, let's say. So the first contact, the dazzling contact of the Light, that you haven't had. But when a HIGHER light comes, you will have it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-853">I am waiting for that moment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-854">I don't know if your mind is critical or if... To make myself clear, I mean whether your critical mind OR your faith, which of the two is stronger ‚Äî I hope it's the faith. So to the faith (not to the critical mind, I don't speak to it), to the faith I say that since the 23rd we've been working hard. And I have asked a great deal that you may, tomorrow, be put into contact with that higher light, that you may have the bedazzlement of the vision of the Light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-855">If you have faith, you will have it. If the critical mind is stronger, it will be slightly delayed, maybe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-856">There, now I've made my confession!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-857">It's as yet an unmanifested supramental light ‚Äî with the first shock of contact, you will see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-858">You understand, I don't want to say anything that encourages the vanity of the ego, if there is any. But your contact with the Light is <em>unusual</em>; for you it has become something quite natural. But the truth is, it's exceptional. So you see people who don't have this realization at all but who enjoy the contact with the Light, precisely because for them it's something marvellous and new ... And so you are <em>deprived</em> (it's Sri Aurobindo speaking to me), <em>deprived</em> of the pleasures they have. But you should know that it's because you have been given a much higher realization. Only, with aspiration, with opening, with</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 131</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-859"> self-giving, can you contact something really new. And then you will have the shock of the new.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-860">This is his answer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-861">But, for that, the mind should keep quiet.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-862">With all these experiences of the cells, how many times all that so-called wisdom, which is in the material consciousness and comes from rubbing against life, from so-called experience ‚Äî the wisdom that comes from experience ‚Äî how many times has it started expressing itself and Sri Aurobindo has said, but <em>mercilessly</em>, "<em>Shut up, you are foolish!</em>"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-863">It has learned its lesson. It has learned its lesson, but quite recently.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-911">Well, read me this notation by Pavitra, I'd be curious to know how it is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-912">"About physical suffering, Mother says:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-913">"There are three different layers or levels of consciousness that are the origin of that suffering. They are as if juxtaposed, superimposed, but don't intermingle. You pass from one to the other in alternation, without fixed order.</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 135</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-914">It's not quite like that. It has become so rigid! Never mind, read on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-915">"One is a repulsion, a fear that sometimes borders on terror. The second is a perverse, unavowed attraction. The third, a sense of inevitability, of 'can't be helped,' of total helplessness.<br/>
"Almost everyone allows himself to be thus ensnared, so there is one remedy ‚Äî only one ‚Äî to cure all those diseases (doctors are something else altogether, they are another ill, which doesn't really cure).<br/>
"This remedy ‚Äî it's good for all earth life ‚Äî is to attain and open up to the consciousness of Harmony ‚Äî not mental or vital harmony, but the 'essential' harmony, the 'principle' of harmony.<br/>
"It's always the same remedy. It's wonderfully effective if one can apply it, but that is difficult because the human consciousness is very unstable, in constant change. That change is what gives man the sense of life and movement. It's absolutely stupid, but that's how it is!<br/>
"So, if one can make one's consciousness stable and bring those juxtaposed layers into contact with the consciousness of harmony, there are seemingly miraculous results. For instance, S. came back this morning, ten years younger; as you know, he was half-dead....</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-918">He even told me (I saw him), he even told me the vision that was at the origin of his cure. And it was really interesting. He said he saw it, as it were, almost with open eyes: everything was dark (it was in the night), the room was dark, he felt absolutely depressed, and ‚Äî it was a heart attack ‚Äî had no more interest in anything, no more interest in life, and felt as if he was letting himself "slip into death," just like</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 136</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-919"> that. Then, suddenly, he thought of me. And ‚Äî he says his eyes were open ‚Äî the whole room was dark, except for a sort of oval of light just in front of him. A quite dazzling oval of light, which remained. So he looked (he wasn't asleep), he looked to see what could be causing that light (he is sufficiently materialistic), but then, nothing ‚Äî he realized there was nothing. Then he started watching that light, and he saw, rising from the bottom (he didn't know from where, couldn't see from where) like a flame ‚Äî two small flames ‚Äî of a very, very pale light, very bright. He found it interesting, and continued to watch. And all of a sudden, he saw in the light the shape of what he calls ... I think it's Mahasaraswati (I forget which, but I think it's Mahasaraswati: "perfection in work"), that he saw there, staying there. And at the same time he felt in himself, oh, a great desire to serve, to work well, to consecrate his life to the divine work, all that. And the next morning, when the doctors came they said, "Oh, everything is changed!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-920">Interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-921">And it coincided with the moment when I was doing my concentration here. (I had got the telegram from a young boy he adopted and is very fond of: he had sent a telegram to let me know that the doctors had all but condemned him.) Then he had that experience ‚Äî it's a transcription, of course, according to his conception. But it's interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-922">But above all, I don't want anyone to know what I am saying here: everyone must be left to his own conception. As for him, he is convinced it's Mahasaraswati who gave him back his life (all the same, he has much devotion for me, but that doesn't matter ...). I don't want it known. I didn't say anything to him, I smiled at him ‚Äî yes, I told him, "You are receptive." And when he expressed his gratitude, I said, "We needed you to do some work." Like that, quite simply.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-923">But I found that interesting, because... It's generally like this: the Force is there, working, and if something comes (a call from someone, a prayer or something), all this (<em>gesture to the forehead</em>) generally remains absolutely still, immobile, letting only the Force pass through, and all I sometimes do is simply (<em>gesture of offering or presenting something upward</em>): "Lord, here is this task, it's for You." That's all, and I leave it. But in this case, I was sitting at my table (the telegram had just come), and I concentrated and quite deliberately and consciously I put him in contact with the Force. Because there was a whole world of suggestions, he expected the end: "This time it's the end." So because of that, I concentrated and put a formation.</p>

And, interestingly, he felt it, he said, "Oh, but it's as if the old man had died, I am a new man." That is to say, I found in him the energy he used to have twenty or thirty years ago.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-934">Yes, all that is very interesting, but I can't get an answer. There's a complete lacuna.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-935"><em>Had you heard sounds or what?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-936">(<em>After a silence</em>) Listen, I'll give you an example. Some two years ago, I had a vision about U.'s son. She had brought him to me (he was almost one) and I had just seen him there (<em>in the music room</em>). He struck me as someone I knew very well, but I didn't know who. Then, that same day in the afternoon, I had a vision. A vision of ancient Egypt, that is I was someone, the high priestess or I don't know who. (Because you don't say to yourself, "I am so and so"! The identification is total, there is no objectivity, so I don't know.) I was inside a wonderful monument, immense, so high! But it was completely bare: there was nothing, except for one place where there were magnificent paintings. That's where I recognized the paintings of ancient Egypt. I was coming out of my apartments and entering a sort of great hall: there was a kind of gutter to collect water (<em>on the ground</em>) running round the walls. And I saw the child (who was half-naked) playing in it. I was very shocked, I said, "What! This is disgusting!" (But the feelings, ideas and so on were all expressed in French in my consciousness.) The tutor came, I had him sent for. I scolded him. I heard sounds ‚Äî well, I don't know what I said, I don't remember those sounds. I heard the sounds I uttered, I knew what they meant, but the expression was in French, and I didn't retain a memory of the sounds. I spoke to him, telling him, "What! You let this child play in that?" And he answered me (I woke up with his answer), saying (I didn't hear the first words, but to my thought it was), "Such is the will of Amenhotep." I heard "Amenhotep," I remembered it. So I knew the child was Amenhotep.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="52" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-937">Therefore, I know I spoke; I spoke in a language, but I don't remember more. I remembered "Amenhotep" because I know the word Amenhotep in my active consciousness. But otherwise, the other</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-938"> sounds didn't stay. I don't have the memory of the sounds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-939">And I know I was his mother; at that moment I knew who I was, because I know that Amenhotep is so and so's son (and also I looked it up in history books). Otherwise there's no connection: a blank.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-940">I always admire those mediums (they generally are very simple people) who have the exact memory of the sound and can tell you, "This and that is what I said." That way we could have a phonetic notation. If I remembered the sounds I uttered we would have the notation, but I don't.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-941">I remember these questions: I suddenly thought, "How interesting it would be to hear that language!" And then, being curious, "How did they rediscover the pronunciation? How?" Besides, all the names of ancient history we were taught when we were very small have been changed now. They said they had rediscovered the sounds, or rather they claimed they did. But I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-942">It's the same thing with ancient Babylon: I have extremely precise and perfectly objective memories, but when I speak I don't remember the sounds I utter, there is only the mental transcription.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-943">I don't have the memory of the sounds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-944">So how did they rediscover them? Do you know?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-945"><em>By crosschecking; that's in fact what Pavitra explains to you. They found stones with inscriptions in Egyptian, in Greek and in Coptic: the same thing said in those three languages. So they pieced it together.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-946">Now, with the gramophone and all that, the sounds will be remembered, but at that time they weren't noted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-947"><em>I wondered what gave rise to your questions.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-948">That's what, the awareness that I don't have the memory of sounds. Some people have the memory of sounds, but I don't. So I'd be interested to know how it was. Otherwise I was always able (when I found something from the past doubtful or interesting or incomplete), I always found a way to recall it into the consciousness. But the sounds don't come. They come as a state of consciousness that's translated mentally, and it's translated mentally into words I know. So that's quite uninteresting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-949">Even now, even when I used to play music, the memory of sounds was vague and incomplete. I had the memory of the sounds I heard at the "origins of music" (<em>gesture above</em>), and when the material</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 140</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-950"> music reproduced something of those sounds, I would recognize them; but there isn't the precision, the accuracy that would enable me to reproduce exactly the sound with the voice or an instrument. It's not there, it's lacking. Whereas the memory of the eyes was ... it was astounding. When I had seen a thing ONCE, that was enough, I would never forget it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-951">Several other times, in visions ("visions," I mean memories: relived memories), I spoke the language of that time, I spoke it and heard myself speak, but the sound didn't stay. The MEANING of what I said stayed, but not the sound.</p>

Because, naturally, the servants were afraid, even the neighbours, anyway it wasn't to their liking. Once, Thoth walked into the room, so the maid started screaming; the neighbour came (luckily he has enough sense), he remained quiet and simply looked at Thoth, with some severity, probably. Then Thoth left without anything happening. But at other</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-958"> times, when Thoth is not happy, he tears up bed sheets or whatever. Finally the neighbour came and told me the incident (that was long ago). I said to him, "You don't know the first thing about animals! Happily you have a peaceful nature, but animals are extremely sensitive to our feelings or sentiments: if you are afraid, they instantly get afraid; if you are angry, they instantly get angry; and if you are gentle, kind, affable, they become gentle, kind, affable." He understood quite well, and ever since all has been well. But he isn't alone in the house.... An orangutan is a big thing, you see!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-959">That Thoth is really remarkable. Did I tell you what happened when I first saw him? (And I asked Y. very insistently whether she had taught him, but she hadn't said anything at all to him ‚Äî neither taught nor said anything.) He came with her, and as soon as he saw me (he was on Y.'s arm), he folded his hands! And then he made a speech to me: his mouth moved; there weren't any sounds, but his mouth moved. And an expression ... Then I complimented him, and he immediately leapt onto my knees, curled up in my arms, and ... went off into a semi-trance ‚Äî stopped moving, kept still. It lasted at least five minutes. After five minutes, I thought, "He can't just stay here forever, he should go now!" ‚Äî then he opened his eyes and went away!... The receptivity is far more remarkable than in human beings. Then he looked around him, looked out of the window, well, took interest in the place. Then he again looked towards me, came back on my knees, and rested against my shoulder.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-960">Long afterwards, a year afterwards, I asked Y. if he was in the habit of greeting with folded hands; she told me, "He's never done it, he did it only with you."

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-993"> the result is the perception of such imbecility!... When you live, while you live something (you don't even know what you live while you live it), you feel you are in a light, that you receive a direction, that you follow that direction, that, well, that a light of consciousness is acting; and when there is that pressure of THE Consciousness (like that, from above; we could call it the "truth-consciousness" or anything ‚Äî THE consciousness), then all you have done, all you have thought, all you have felt, all you have seen, all those things which appeared to be conscious ... it all becomes so idiotic that you really need a faith very ...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-994">All morning I reviewed all kinds of movements of consciousness (not a recollection in thought or sensation or vision, but a recollection in the consciousness) of whole periods of life, especially life with Sri Aurobindo, because at the time, I felt I was relying on the divine Consciousness and acting under its pressure (already); so it's interesting that it should now look like an abyss of imbecility. And then, you wonder what Sri Aurobindo ‚Äî he who was conscious ‚Äî what he must have felt? How he must have seen all that around him, all those people bustling and acting and moving around him ... (<em>Mother takes her head in her hands</em>). You say to yourself that if he had the consciousness which is here now (he surely had it! He had that consciousness), well, it was a marvel of patience. That's my conclusion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-995">You see, an undeniable goodwill, a will to do the right thing (<em>Mother is speaking about herself</em>), an attitude that seemed as good as possible, and already the sense of a <em>surrender</em> and an effort to express not at all personal movements, but the guiding Will ‚Äî all that, that whole attitude (which at the time seemed quite good), seen with today's consciousness!...

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1012">Here, I added, "But anyway, since you ask me the question, I will answer you."</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1013">"The Divine is an absolute of perfection, eternal source of all that exists, whom we grow progressively conscious of, while being Him from all eternity."</p>

All that we want to become ‚Äî that's the Divine." He was so happy! He told me, "Oh, that way it becomes easy!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1015">But when you look at it ‚Äî when you emerge from mental activity and look at the experience you have, you wonder, "How to say it? How to explain it?" ... The nearest, most accessible, is this: into that "something" we aspire to become, we instinctively, spontaneously put everything we want to exist, all the most marvellous things we can imagine, all the objects of an intense (and ignorant) aspiration, all of that. And with all that, you draw near "something" and ... In fact, you don't get the contact through thought; you get the contact through something IDENTICAL in the being, which is awakened by the intensity of the aspiration. So, as soon as you have got for yourself, be it for one second, this contact ‚Äî this fusion ‚Äî there's no more need to explain: it's something that imposes itself in an absolute way, and that is outside and beyond all explanation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1016">But to get there, everyone puts into it all that makes it easier to lead him there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1017">And when you have the experience, at the time of this fusion, this junction, to the consciousness it's obvious that the identical alone can know the identical, and that consequently it's proof that That is there (<em>Mother points to the heart centre</em>). It's a proof that That is there. And through the effort of aspiration, It awakens.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1018">When I was given the question, it was just as if that person were saying to me, "Yes, yes, that's all very fine, but after all, what IS the Divine!"

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1020">And at the same time, when there was that look at the "something" which had to be defined, there was a great silence everywhere and a great aspiration (<em>gesture like a rising flame</em>), and all the forms that that aspiration has taken. It was very interesting.... The history of the aspiration of the earth ... towards the marvellous Unknown we want to become.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1021">And each one ‚Äî each one who was destined to effect the junction ‚Äî believes in his simplicity that the bridge he has walked is the only one. The result: religions, philosophies, dogmas, creeds ‚Äî battle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1022">Seen as a whole, it's very interesting, very charming, with a Smile that looks on. Oh, that Smile ... looking on. That Smile seems to be saying, "How complicated you make it! When it could be so simple."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1023">To put it in a literary way, we could say, "So much complication for something so simple: to be oneself."</p>

And not an answer with words that can be argued, an answer ... like that, a something: a vibration that's something almost constant now.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1028">Naturally, men create difficulties (I think they must love them, because ...), for everything, the SLIGHTEST thing, there's always a world of difficulties. So you spend your time saying, "<em>Quiet, quiet, quiet</em> ‚Äî be quiet."

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1038">"I know it is the Russian explanation of the recent trend to spirituality and mysticism that it is a phenomenon of capitalist society in its decadence. But to read an economic cause, conscious or unconscious, into all phenomena of man's history is part of the Bolshevik gospel born of the fallacy of Karl Marx. Man's nature is not so simple and one-chorded as all that ‚Äî it has many lines and each line produces a need of his life. The spiritual or mystic line is one of them and man tries to satisfy it in various ways, by superstitions of all kinds, by ignorant religionism, by spiritism, demonism and what not, in his more enlightened parts by spiritual philosophy, the higher occultism and the rest, at his highest by the union with the All, the Eternal or the Divine. The tendency towards the search of spirituality began in Europe with a recoil from the nineteenth century's scientific materialism, a dissatisfaction with the pretended all-sufficiency of the reason and the intellect and a feeling out for something deeper. That was a pre-war [of 1914] phenomenon, and began when there was no menace of Communism and the capitalistic world was at its height of insolent success and triumph, and it came rather as a revolt against the materialistic bourgeois life and its ideals, not as an attempt to serve or sanctify it. It has been at once served and opposed by the post-war disillusionment ‚Äî opposed because the post-war world has fallen back either on cynicism and the life of the senses or on movements like Fascism and Communism; served because with the deeper minds the dissatisfaction with the ideals of the past or the present, with all mental or vital or</p></blockquote>
<p class="p-num">Page 150</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1039"> material solutions of the problem of life has increased and only the spiritual path is left. It is true that the European mind having little light on these things dallies with vital will-o-the-wisps like spiritism or theosophy or falls back upon the old religionism; but the deeper minds of which I speak either pass by them or pass through them in search of a greater Light. I have had contact with many and the above tendencies are very clear. They come from all countries and it was only a minority who hailed from England or America. Russia is different ‚Äî unlike the others it has lingered in mediaeval religionism and not passed through any period of revolt ‚Äî so when the revolt came it was naturally anti-religious and atheistic. It is only when this phase is exhausted that Russian mysticism can revive and take not a narrow religious but the spiritual direction. It is true that mysticism <em>√† revers</em>, turned upside down, has made Bolshevism and its endeavour a creed rather than a political theme and a search for the paradisal secret millennium on earth rather than the building of a purely social structure. But for the most part Russia is trying to do on the communistic basis all that nineteenth-century idealism hoped to get at ‚Äî and failed ‚Äî in the midst of or against an industrial competitive environment. Whether it will really succeed any better is for the future to decide ‚Äî for at present it only keeps what it has got by a tension and violent control which is not over."</p>

When one has the real thing in oneself, one goes through and finally takes the full way of sadhana, but it is only a minority that does so. It is better to receive only people who come of themselves and of these only those in whom the call is genuinely their own and persistent."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1129">I saw Y. on the 31st. She stayed for about an hour and told me of her hopes: she sees the possibility of a sort of world television (I don't know how that would be arranged), with a telephone, and there would be a central office with a collection of answers to all possible questions ‚Äî each question answered by someone eminent or qualified. The result would be the organization of a universal education ‚Äî well, terrestrial ‚Äî that would really be an education for all countries, in which the knowledge and best qualities of every country in the artistic, literary and scientific fields would be gathered in a kind of transmitting centre, and all you would have to do would be to get into communication with it. So then, instead of having more or less incapable teachers to teach what they also know more or less, you would have the answer to every question, the most competent and best answer. Thus there would really be all over the earth an education that would be the best possible, from which everyone would receive only what he wants; you wouldn't have to attend classes, a number of useless classes, in order to catch the little you want to know: you would have it just by getting into communication with the centre; you would ask for such and such a number and would get your answer.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 164</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1130">If it could be realized, it would be very good. It means that the most beautiful works of art, the most beautiful teachings, all the best of what humanity is GOING to produce, would be collected and within reach of all those who had a television. There would be the image along with the explanation, or the text or speech. A kind of imposing central building where everything would be gathered. I found it rather attractive. I told her that we would have that in Auroville (not the central office: just a receiving set). She said that instead of teachers who teach poorly what they know, there would be the best teaching on each subject.... (I didn't ask her WHO would select those people ‚Äî that remains the somewhat delicate point.) But I found the idea very attractive. She said things are moving in that direction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1131"><em>Yes, but it's still a kind of encyclopedia....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1132">Yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1133"><em>It's very interesting, but the best education is one that could put you in contact with the region of knowledge where you find all answers.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1134">Ah, that would be very good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1135"><em>Yes, that would be the true education. It's not finding answers in a super-library, but catching hold of something up above ‚Äî and you have all the answers.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1136">But that's more difficult, isn't it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1137"><em>Maybe not.... When I was a kid, I was quite conscious of being able to PULL something down from above, and that the answer was there, above.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1138">Yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1139"><em>On the contrary, they're taught to rely on books, precisely on encyclopedias. I had to come here to understand what it meant, why I used to "pull" from above. That is to say, it wasn't at all encouraged when I was a child.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 165</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1140">But Z has done experiments like that. He told me the story of a girl at the School who had no imagination: when she was asked a question she could only answer what she had learned, and when she was given a problem she could never solve it. She was like that, blocked above. And he taught her to try and make contact precisely with that intuitive zone, by keeping quiet, falling silent and listening. And it seems that after some time, she had extraordinary results in that way, by falling silent and listening ‚Äî answers which were really remarkable and certainly came from the region of intuition. And that's a practical fact, he did it at the School.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1141"><em>Well, that's what should be done, it's much more important.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1142">Far more important than a machine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1143">I listened to what she said and simply found it was better than recruiting incompetent teachers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1144">But there still remained a doubt (which I didn't discuss) on the quality of the CHOICE of answers. Whereas if you go there, to the Origin, then you're sure!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1145">That's what they are now trying to do here in their new classes: teaching them to make contact with the intuitive zone.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1147">I have something to add to what we said the other day about the Divine.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="60" href="#">1</a> Someone asks me, "And whatever is God?"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1148">It's about a text from Sri Aurobindo. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1149">"Love leads us from the suffering of division into the bliss of perfect union, but without losing that joy of the act of union which is the soul's greatest discovery and for which the life of the cosmos is a long preparation. Therefore to approach God by love is to prepare oneself for the greatest possible spiritual fulfilment."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1150" style="text-align: right;">(<em>The Synthesis of Yoga</em>, XXI.III.523)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 166</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1151">It's about the last sentence; someone has asked me, "What is God?" So I've replied (taking the word "God"):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1152">"It is the name man has given to all that exceeds and dominates him, all that he cannot know but is subject to."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1153">Instead of saying "to all that exceeds him," we could say, "to THAT WHICH exceeds him," because from the intellectual standpoint, "all that which" is debatable. I mean there is a "something" ‚Äî an indefinable and inexplicable something ‚Äî and man has always felt dominated by that something. It is beyond all possible understanding and dominates him. And then, religions have given it a name; man has called it "God"; the French call it <em>Dieu</em>, the English, <em>God</em>, in another language it's called differently, but anyway it's the same.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1154">I am intentionally not giving any definition. Because my lifelong feeling has been that it's a mere word, and a word behind which people put a lot of very undesirable things.... It's that idea of a god who claims to be "the one and only," as they say: "God is the one and only." But they feel it and say it in the way Anatole France put it (I think it was in <em>The Revolt of Angels</em>): this God who wants to be the one and only and ALL ALONE. That was what had made me a complete atheist, if I may say so, in my childhood; I refused to accept a being, WHOEVER HE WAS, who proclaimed himself to be the one and only and almighty. Even if he were indeed the one and only and almighty (<em>laughing</em>), he should have no right to proclaim it! That's how it was in my mind. I could make an hour-long speech on this, to show how in every religion they tackled the problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1155">In any case, I have given what I find is the most objective definition. And as in the other day's "What is the Divine?", I have tried to give a feeling of the Thing; here I wanted to fight against the use of the word which, to me, is hollow, but dangerously so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1156"><em>I remember a very powerful line in "Savitri" which says it all wonderfully in one sentence. He says, "The bodiless Namelessness that saw God BORN...."</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="61" href="#">2</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1157" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 167</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1158">I told you the other day that I had met D. before she left (<em>in search of a Tibetan guru</em>) and we had spoken. I spoke to her of Sri Aurobindo and his teaching. And she has been converted! Yes, really. She wrote me another letter today, which I've just received (it's the second letter she has written to me from up there), in which she says she has met that famous Tibetan sage with whom she wanted to discuss.... He seems to have made fun of her (she doesn't say so), but she says he "constantly brings you face to face with your mental formations" (he must have shown her that she was feeding on words). And then she adds, "But as for me, I feel, I do feel your love always with me, and everything is fine." ‚Äî Never! It's the first time in her life she has told me this.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1159">So it gave me the idea of writing down what I told her about Sri Aurobindo's teaching:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1160">"In order to understand and follow Sri Aurobindo's teaching, one must learn to rise above all possibility of contradiction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1161">That is, to reach the region where contradictions no longer exist. That's true. You understand, if you take quotations from Sri Aurobindo on a particular subject, you can put side by side things that are just the opposite of each other: he says one thing, then its opposite, then again something else. So, to understand him and not keep saying to yourself, "But why does he constantly say the contrary of what he has said!" you must learn to rise up above ‚Äî up above, it's quite fine(!) There, it's... very interesting. Once you are above, it's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1162">And from the practical point of view, the remarkable thing is that in that region, which is beyond all possible contradictions, there lies the source of the true Power.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1163">But I mean that we could find in Sri Aurobindo a sentence saying, for instance, that "God" is a word empty of meaning into which man puts whatever he likes, and then a description similar to the one I gave of the Divine. And throughout all his writings, it's like that for everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1164" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1165">And then I would like to publish this quotation from Sri Aurobindo:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 168</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1166">"The traditions of the past are very great in their own place, in the past, but I do not see why we should merely repeat them and not go farther. In the spiritual development of the consciousness upon earth the great past ought to be followed by a greater future."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1172"><em>What's going to happen?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1173">(<em>After a long silence</em>) We are just like this (<em>gesture hanging in balance between two chasms</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1174">Yesterday, I would have answered very firmly.... Let me tell you what happened. We had here an American, a very nice boy who, before he came here, was a paratroop instructor in Israel's army. I don't think he is an Israeli, I think he's American; I am sure his nationality is American, I saw his passport. But he was a paratroop instructor in Israel's army. When those two started quarrelling, he wrote me a letter in which he explained it, and also paid great compliments to the Israeli nation, saying they had achieved a really remarkable sense of brotherhood and cooperation. That was his impression of the country. And he said that if war broke out, he would like to go back there to help them as much as he could. So as soon as they started bombing each other, he decided to go. He left yesterday evening. And I saw him in the afternoon, before he left.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1175">He is a sincere man. While he was here, Sri Aurobindo ... (how can I explain?), the impression is that Sri Aurobindo "concretizes" (he is always there, but at certain times he seems to concretize, as though ... (<em>Mother makes a gesture of gathering or condensing</em>). That's really the impression: he concretizes and starts speaking). So, first Sri Aurobindo said to him (but there was a whole WORLD in it), "My blessings are with you."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1176">The man was very touched (I didn't tell him it was Sri Aurobindo;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 169</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1177"> I spoke, you understand, it was my mouth that spoke then, but it was Sri Aurobindo who spoke). Then I concentrated, and Sri Aurobindo said with great force:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1178">"All the countries live in falsehood. If only one country stood courageously for truth, the world might be saved."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1179" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1180">Towards the end of the day, when I was alone, I began asking Sri Aurobindo precisely what he meant.... Naturally, his hope is that the country that "<em>stood for Truth</em>" will be India ‚Äî for the moment, she is very far from it. But... And since the subject was before me, I asked him how he saw the terrestrial possibility, in a harmonious future.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1181">Then he said to me ‚Äî it was very simple, very clear: "A federation of all nations and countries without exception, all continents. A single federation: the federation of all human nations of the earth." And a group ‚Äî a governing group ‚Äî consisting of one representative from each country, <em>the most able man</em> from the standpoint of political and economic organization. And nothing of the proportional question that would give large countries many representatives and small ones only one ‚Äî one representative for each country. Because each country represents one aspect of the problem. And they would sit in rotation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1182">It was a vast vision, not so much with words as with a vision.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1183">That's where things stand. Today ... Have you heard today's news?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1184"><em>They have blocked Suez and broken off with the United States.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1186">If this news is true (because the amount of lies that go around is unbelievable), if this news is true, it means the Pressure is beginning ‚Äî the pressure of the Consciousness. It has already started acting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1187">You see, every national entity has a right to free and independent existence, provided it doesn't interfere in the free and independent existence of all other entities. Ambitions, territorial expansions ‚Äî </p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1188">naturally, all colonies and all that ‚Äî must be swept out of the picture. To defend themselves, the Egyptians say the Israelis had publicly declared Israel's border should be the Nile ‚Äî I don't know if that's true. I don't know if it's true because everybody tells lies. On their side, the Egyptians publicly declared three years ago (it was a public declaration), they publicly declared that the Israeli nation had no right to exist and had to disappear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1189"><em>Three days ago, Nasser declared that he wanted "the destruction of Israel: wiped off the map."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1190">Yes, that's it. But three years ago, they declared that Israel shouldn't exist. So that clearly puts them in the wrong.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1191">I don't know how the others replied.... The whole world lives in falsehood, without a doubt, but one thing must be established in an absolute way: the right of each nation or country to individual existence, provided it doesn't interfere in another nation's right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1192">That should be the base.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1193">Of course, they will start arguing: "BUT at that time, things were like that; at that time they were like this; and in the past this was ours; in the past..." Endless arguments. So there should be a higher vision, which is a balanced and just and deep vision of things, that can say, "This is how it is." Otherwise there would be an indefinite source of arguments.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1194">For the moment, in any case, all diplomatic relations are based on falsehood ‚Äî and the crudest falsehood at that: it's recognized as a necessity and the only way out. That's how they consider it. So that's what must be abolished to begin with.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1197">It's something to be envisaged.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1198">But the difficulty is to find the "someone," because it should be a man who knows Sri Aurobindo thoroughly to begin with, who is capable of receiving his inspirations directly (a very difficult condition), and has at the same time a very strong character with a power ‚Äî a contagious power ‚Äî and a force that can arouse the inert</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>For the past eight days Mother has been "ill," just as the conflict between Israel and Egypt was unfolding.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1230">A great battle.... I have learned a great many things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1231">And it's going on.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1232">I've made discoveries.... Diseases, accidents, catastrophes, wars, all that, is because the human material consciousness is so small, so narrow that it has a rabid taste for drama. And of course, behind there is the vital being having fun, influences too... anyway all that enjoys an opportunity to delay the divine Work and make things difficult. And all that takes pleasure in that naturally encourages drama. But the seed of the difficulty is that pettiness, extreme pettiness of the physical consciousness ‚Äî the material physical consciousness ‚Äî which has an absolutely perverse taste for drama. Drama ‚Äî the slightest thing has to make a drama: if you have a toothache, it becomes a drama<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="67" href="#">1</a>; if you bang against something, it becomes a drama; if two nations quarrel, it becomes a drama ‚Äî everything becomes a drama. The taste for drama. The slightest upset in the body, the least disorder, which should go completely unnoticed, oh, it makes a big fuss,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 174</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1233"> a drama. The taste for drama. I was thoroughly disgusted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1234">Everything, everything... Like the loud buzz at a fair.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1235">The attack was apparently violent, so violent that after studying and observing it I was forced to think that some people were amusing themselves doing black magic.... Everything took on fantastic proportions. The same teeth I've had for such a long time (in the same state for such a long time, that is!), which for years hadn't given me any trouble, suddenly fancied they too had to make a drama! So, a raging toothache, swelling ‚Äî absolutely ridiculous, absolutely. And you know, this discovery of drama wasn't thought out, it wasn't an observation: it was an acute experience, caught hold of as you would catch a thief. I caught it. And it's universal, all over the earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1236">Because EVERYTHING was creating drama ‚Äî the loud buzz of a fair, the tumult, all of it, a big fuss. Like those people over there when they fought each other, the same fuss (<em>gesture expressing the seething turmoil of the war</em>). What a to-do they make! What with "rights" and "duties" and "honour," oh!... Then, as things were pretty bad (I was almost completely incapacitated<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="68" href="#">2</a>), I asked what it meant (<em>Mother laughs</em>), and he showed me the picture! Then I understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1237">The minute I understood, things started calming down (<em>the raging toothache as well as the raging war in Palestine</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1238">It's profoundly ridiculous, and unhealthy, moreover.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1239">You understand, once the thing had been seen ‚Äî seen and felt and lived completely ‚Äî they started slowing down there. I can't say things are quite all right as yet, far from it, but anyway I think the worst of the catastrophe has been averted.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="69" href="#">3</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1240">Grotesque.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1241">Things are somewhat better. There is still some friction.... "Traitors," "enemies," oh!... Now they say that Indonesia and Pakistan are up to something.... And with EVERYTHING, you know, from the biggest to the smallest, from what seems the most important (what disturbs the most things, at any rate) to the least little physical discomfort, it's like that: a very small, such a very small consciousness, petty and limited like that, and narrow, which makes a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1242">There you are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1243" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 175</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1244">Because what took place is nothing new, it has happened so many times before, but the body's experience was different.... Previously, the consciousness of all the other inner beings was there and would fortunately counterbalance this idiotic tendency: even the vital, the vital being which also loves grand effects, but provided at least they are great, vast, powerful enough to be on a large scale and save it from being ridiculous; and then, positively above all that, all the rest, with a smile. But this time, this body was left TO ITSELF, to learn. And it has learned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1245">But death too, is the result of the taste for drama ‚Äî what a pretty drama, ugh!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1246" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1247">Well, there you are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1248">And as, naturally, it became impossible to eat, another consequence was that it became impossible to do anything.... The doctor made me take proteins that don't need to be digested, those that are directly injected into the blood, but he made me swallow them. Then I was able to resume some work ‚Äî I could no longer speak, no longer eat, no longer...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1249">It went on worsening nicely, till the day (I forget which) when I said with "great indignation" (<em>Mother takes on a dramatic tone</em>), "What is this creation in which..." (I said it in English) "in which living is suffering, dying is suffering, everything is suffering...." (<em>Mother laughs</em>) As soon as that was uttered, it was enough. And the consciousness was there, saying, "There is only one remedy, but the world rejects that remedy." So I was put in the presence of the fact, face to face with it, the thing staring at me ‚Äî oh, what a pretty drama!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1250" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1251">I wondered whether it was peculiar to the earth and if the other planets and suns weren't in this idiotic situation?... On an external level it would be interesting to know. But I am practically certain that death, for instance, is something that belongs exclusively to earth life ‚Äî death as we FEEL it, as we understand it. Yet animals take part in it, but they don't have man's mental deformation.... But the taste for drama is exclusively human, because those animals that live with man catch the malady, while those that don't live with man don't have it at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1252" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 176</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1253">I saw this child (<em>Sujata</em>) on Sunday; I didn't look too great, did I?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1254"><em>(Sujata:) No, Mother!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1255">I couldn't speak anymore....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1256">Well, that's more or less something of my experience. Oh, it was ... many things, many more things than that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1257">For two days the impression of not knowing whether you are alive or dead (but these are words on the surface), of not being very sure of the difference it makes.... And then, the body asking this question: "But everyone has his theory: one says [death] is like this, another says it's like that, another one says something different again, but what is our OWN experience like?..." And it was like that (<em>gesture of hanging between two worlds</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1258">Then the body suddenly remembered (that was rather interesting; it's more recent, it was yesterday or the day before), the body suddenly remembered that it had once been brought back to life. It said, "But you knew at that time, you knew since you brought me back to life."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="70" href="#">4</a> Then I recollected what I used to know (and had stopped knowing because the knowledge was quite incomplete ‚Äî it was entirely external and lacked the higher knowledge), I recollected the experience, and the two things came together (<em>the old knowledge and the new</em>). "Now," I said, "this is interesting!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1259">You know, the story of the soul "leaving the body," is childishness! Because I had that experience too, of leaving (not the soul! It's entirely independent, always and in everyone), of leaving the psychic being, the individual psychic being. When I left here in 1915, I left my psychic being here deliberately. I left it here, I didn't take it with me. Consequently, the body can live without the psychic being (it was rather sick, by the way, but that wasn't the reason ‚Äî it's again the taste for drama!... Oh, always the taste for drama!).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1260">There we are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1261">So the problem narrows down more and more.... If your most material vital being goes out, it doesn't make you die ‚Äî it puts you in catalepsy, but it doesn't make you die. What makes you die?...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1262">There are two things that make you die. One (the one that precedes the dramatic human existence) is wear and tear. What does wear and tear come from? From Ignorance, obviously. From Ignorance and the incapacity to renew forces; and that means the whole lower life: it decomposes, recomposes, decomposes again.... But it's only with</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 177</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1263"> animality and the beginning of a mental functioning that (<em>Mother takes on a grandiloquent tone</em>) "death" comes, such as we conceive it. But that is when the vital element that gives life (what we call "life") breaks down. There are innumerable reasons for that, all of which stem from the same source. Of course, taken together, it is the incapacity to follow the movement of progress: the need to remix everything together in order to start all over again. But for those who are beginning to think, that no longer has any reason to exist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1264">An accident?... An accident to the material combination? But what accident, since the heart can stop and start again? It's a question of how long the accident lasts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1265">If, for this wear and tear, this deterioration (which comes from the Inconscient and is the result of the RESISTANCE of the Inconscient), if for this we can substitute the aspiration for progress and transformation (not with words ‚Äî the vibration)... That experience has been given to me several times. For example, suppose there is something which goes wrong, there is a pain somewhere, something disorganized that no longer works properly; if there is the vision and conception in the faith (faith and consecration to the Supreme) that it's deliberate, that the Supreme has allowed it to be (how can I express it? All words are meaningless), has allowed or willed it, or wanted it to be, because to Him it seems the best way to transform the thing, to have it make the necessary progress, if the cells that are somewhat disorganized and "sick," as they say, are able to feel this... then straight away it takes a marvellous turn for the better ‚Äî immediately, in five minutes, ten minutes. I could give concrete, precise examples, with all the details. So that means bringing the two extremes into contact, we could say. And if that can become the normal life of the elements which make up this outer form, then there is no reason why... No, there is no need to die, no need whatsoever. There comes a point when death loses all meaning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1266">And one learns in the smallest detail, in the little cell or the faint sensation (and when it comes down to feelings, there is something which is the embryo of thought ‚Äî oh, then...), the taste for drama. Ah, then everything is explained.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1267">The taste for drama, the need for catastrophe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1268">That's what was there, pressing and pressing on the earth to bring about all the conditions for a resounding grand finale (<em>Mother shrugs her shoulders</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1269">And only one remedy: a widening into eternal peace ... To break limits, become immense.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1270" style="text-align: right;">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 178</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1271"><em>You said just a while ago that your body remembered an earlier death...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1272">Oh, yes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1273"><em>But you didn't say what that recollection was.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1274">Yes, everybody knows it: it happened at Tlemcen while I was working with Th√©on. I had gone out in a wholly material way, the body was in a cataleptic state, and something came, something occurred that cut the link. So the link was cut.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1275"><em>But what was the experience like at that time?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1276">The experience was that... (<em>laughing</em>) impossible to get back in there! But Th√©on was there (Th√©on got such a fright!), and there was at that time the knowledge of the occult (a good deal of knowledge!), the knowledge was there and then the will (<em>Mother makes a gesture of pushing to re-enter the body</em>), and also an inner faith (but I never used to talk about that), and a concentration. And he was capable, he knew. He knew how to "pull." And the body hadn't deteriorated, you see, it wasn't damaged, so it wasn't difficult. It was in very good condition, but the thread was cut, which means that what gives life had gone out and could not get back in.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1277">I came back in as a result of the power and the will, because... In fact, simply because I still had something to do on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1278">It happened in 1910, I think.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1279"><em>Thus it's not because the soul leaves the body.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1280">Oh, that's just words!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1281">It is likely that the soul resolves, having seen that the body is either unworthy or unfit or incapable or unwilling or... whatever, and so the soul decides that the body must die and it may go; but it is not the fact of the soul's going that kills the body. There are innumerable people who are without a soul ‚Äî they have a soul, but their soul isn't in their body ‚Äî many people. And they go on living quite well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1282">It's more difficult however, to live without the psychic being. The psychic being, of course, is the covering ‚Äî the individualized covering ‚Äî between the eternal soul and the transitory body; and it becomes formed, individualized, it becomes more and more individually conscious. When that leaves the body, the rest generally follows. But I</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 179</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1283"> myself have had the experience of doing it deliberately, so I KNOW. One has to know how to do it, but it can be done. My psychic being stayed here with Sri Aurobindo, and I left with my mental, vital and physical beings. It was a ... slightly precarious condition. But as I also kept the contact quite consciously, it could be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1284">What people call "death"... I see lots of people who to me are living dead (they are those who are without their psychic being, or even those who have no contact with their soul). But to know that, one must have the inner vision. But what people call "death," that is, the decomposition of the cells and dissolution of the form, is when the most material "vital subdegree," which brings into contact with Life ‚Äî with the vital force, life ‚Äî goes out. That is how death occurs in animals, for example. And that vital subdegree generally goes away when the external organism is unable to continue ‚Äî when, for instance, it's cut in two or the heart has been removed, or anyway when something quite radical has happened to it! Because some people have met with accidents and had many parts missing, yet they lived on. But even cardiac arrest I can say, even that doesn't necessarily mean death, since after stopping, the heart can start up again. Those who have the material knowledge tell you that during a few... I don't know if it is a few seconds or a few minutes, the heart can start up again; after that, decomposition sets in. With decomposition it's over, naturally.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1285">Therefore, we could correctly say that there are kinds of GRADATIONS in death. Gradations in life and gradations in death: there are beings that are more or less alive, or if we want to put it negatively, there are beings that are more or less dead. Oh! But for those who know, and who know that this material form can manifest a supramental light, well, those who don't have the supramental light in them are already a little dead. That's how it is. So there are gradations. What people are accustomed to call "death" is just a purely external phenomenon, because it's something they can't deny: it falls to pieces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1286">But I have seen people who were supposedly dead (not many in my family because it wasn't the custom to let the children see them, and once I was grown-up there were only very few occasions), but I have seen a few here. And they weren't all in the same state at all ‚Äî not at all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1287" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1288">There was the case of Sri Aurobindo. "He is dead," the doctors</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 180</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1289"> decided ‚Äî he was absolutely alive. Absolutely living. And even after five days, when they put him into ... it was because of (how should I put it?) the pressure of the outside world, and because it was impossible to preserve him. We had to consent. But I cannot say he was dead! He wasn't at all dead, it was perfectly obvious. The body was already beginning to ... (very little, but a little at the end of the fifth day), that is, the skin was losing its colour, but ... (<em>Mother makes a glorious gesture</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1290">For the first three days, I remained standing there, near his bed, and in an absolutely ‚Äî well, to me, it was absolutely visible ‚Äî all the organized consciousness that was in his body DELIBERATELY came out of it and into mine. And not only did I see it but I felt the FRICTION of its entry.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1291">Then people say, "He is dead" ‚Äî that's ignorance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1292" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1293">All that supramental power he had gradually attracted into and organized in his body came into me METHODICALLY.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1294">I didn't say anything to anyone because it was nobody's business, nobody's concern. I remained standing there and ... (<em>gesture showing the forces passing from Sri Aurobindo into Mother's body</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1295">You know, people revel in high-sounding words and go on talking and talking ‚Äî they don't even know what they're talking about.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1296">Not very long ago, I saw first of all one or two photographs of someone, then he came to see me. I said, "He is dead, he's a dead man." And I don't mean dissolution at all (of course not! Since he came in and spoke ‚Äî he spoke very loudly, thinking himself very alive, in fact): he was dead. So....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1297" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1298">Some time ago, I had said that the cells were wondering, "But what is death?" They kept wondering like that. And just yesterday or the day before, because of a certain state which came, it was as if the Knowledge that constantly comes from above was saying to them, "Why? Why do you wonder? You have had the experience, you know how it is." Then, to the small central cellular consciousness (there is a small central consciousness of the cells,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="71" href="#">5</a> which is now gradually growing and being worked out), this Knowledge said, "Don't you remember? You know how it was." Ah, then the memory of the full</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 181</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1299"> experience in all its details came back ‚Äî it was true, they did know.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1311">What makes me think that there were external adverse wills is that from every side there kept coming fine-sounding words ‚Äî fine-sounding sentences, suggestions (dramatic suggestions, precisely) announcing a considerable number of catastrophes. They come from every side, like this (<em>swarming gesture, like a rising tide</em>), like so many snakes waiting there, kept at arm's length, rushing up as soon as they're given the opportunity to do so.... Which proves that there's clearly something the matter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1312">Suggestions like this one, for instance: "Oh, now you're well, you are strong and can speak ‚Äî ah, but you'll see what happens to you." Suggestions and suggestions.... You understand, it can only come from rotten human thoughts. A swarm of things, each one uglier than the next one, comes like that. And you see them come (<em>same gesture like a rising tide of snakes</em>), you see them come like that.... From the basest to the most violent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1313">There was also, in relation to those possibilities of magic and also to "adverse " forces, a vision of it all as being a part of the great Play (<em>gesture from below</em>), but...

In the higher part, it's a mixture of perverted mind and extremely powerful vital, which obviously takes pleasure in the distortion; and as That becomes more concrete it becomes all those human reactions; and when That draws near the earth, then... ah, you have the fine mess men have made of the earth's atmosphere. So this Thing, this smiling, luminous, marvellous Immensity, so...which is a living and conscious bliss... That is what it becomes.</p>

<p class="Ps"><b>THE END OF THE ASURA</b></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1356">If, as Sri Aurobindo announced, the supramental Power is to enter a realizing phase in 1967 and if, as Mother said, the fate of the present civilization is to be settled in 1967, it is clear that the earth's many latent diseases must come out in the open and find a focus somewhere, as an abscess is the focal point for the disease of the body, our earth body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1357">There are no "catastrophes." The Supramental is a force of order and harmony. Thus what may seem to us at first glance to be a catastrophe is bound to actually put things in order, work in every way and every detail towards putting the earth in order.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1358">September-October is generally the month of wars.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1359">There is only one place in the world where the issue is being played out really and symbolically ‚Äî that is India. That is where, therefore, the disease of the earth must be focused. It is in the order of things that the last Asura should come and die at the feet of the Mother.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1360">But India, supposed to embody the forces of truth, is herself prey to the same Falsehood as is the rest of the earth. The Asura is also</p>

Here India shall receive the blessed blow that will liquidate her untrue government and will give way to a military government that will prepare a more truthful government. Here China shall receive the blow that will free her from her Maoist Asura, while at the same time bringing Russia and America closer together against the common danger. Here Vietnam will lose its two untrue henchmen, in the North and in the South, and will put its own house in order.

Behind, there is the consciousness of the physical mind (what I call the "cellular mind") which is constantly conscious of the divine Presence and anxious to allow nothing but That; then a whole work is going on to change, to shift the origin of movements. I mean that instead of them being just automatic; out of habit, the divine Consciousness and Presence automatically makes the movements (<em>Mother makes the gesture of forcing the consciousness into the body</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1370">But it's quite ... quite inexpressible, that is, as soon as you try to express it, it becomes mentalized, it's no longer the thing. That's why it's very difficult to express. I can't speak of it.</p>

Does that state of consciousness, that way of being, that way of existing, reacting, expressing, does it strive towards the Divine Manifestation? Is it in conformity with the tendency towards the Divine Manifestation?...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1403">I am trying to do it ‚Äî not out of an arbitrary will, not at all: there is simply "something," or someone, or a consciousness or whatever (I don't want to talk about it) which uses this (<em>Mother's body</em>) to try and do something with it. This means that I do the work and am a witness at the same time, and as for the "I," I don't know where it is: it's not inside, it's not up above, it's not ... I don't know where it is, it's for the requirements of language. There is "something" that does and witnesses the thing at the same time, and is at the same time the action being done: the three things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1404">Because now, the body itself really collaborates as much as it can ‚Äî as much as it can ‚Äî with an ever-increasing goodwill and power of endurance, and the self-observation is truly reduced to a minimum (there is still some, like something touching lightly now and then, but not even for a few seconds). Self-observation, oh, that means a thoroughly disgusting, repugnant and catastrophic atmosphere. It's like that, FELT like that. And it's becoming increasingly impossible, I see that, it's visible.... But there is still the whole weight of millennia of bad habits, which we could call pessimistic, that is, anticipating decay, anticipating catastrophe, anticipating ... well, all those things, and, ugh! that's the most difficult thing to purify, to clarify, to remove from the atmosphere. It's so INGRAINED that it's absolutely spontaneous. That is the great, great, great obstacle ‚Äî that sort of sense of inevitable decay.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1405">Naturally, from the mental standpoint, the entire earth atmosphere is like that, but in the mind it hardly matters at all: one ray of light and it's swept away.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1408">And of course, the being isn't isolated, the body isn't isolated: it is something of a multitude, with varying degrees of proximity; but very near, there are all those who are here, and it's the same problem ‚Äî the same problem. Because all that has been gained in the consciousness of this being hasn't been gained at all in the consciousness of others. So that increases the work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1409">The problem of mental, even vital, contagion is solved, so to speak, but the problem of material contagion remains.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1410">And in this material consciousness, there is this material mind which has so marvellously responded here (<em>in Mother</em>), but it doesn't yet have the power to assert itself spontaneously against what comes from outside, that never-ending contagion, constant, constant, every minute.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1475"><em>All the toes, yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1476">That is to say, a certain number of people.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1477">In my vision, his two feet were me. But in my vision, his feet had white <em>tabis</em> on, to make me clearly understand that it was me.

<p class="p-num">Page 202</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1490">That's right.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1491">On Sunday (evening), before going to bed, I complained (I can't say I complained very seriously, but you know, like when one is in a grumpy mood), I complained, saying, "But since You want me to manifest You, why do you allow me to feel so out of sorts!" There were all kinds of inconveniences ‚Äî small ones, naturally, but when there are lots of them they add up to inconvenience full stop. So (<em>laughing</em>) I was grumbling! It lasted for the space of a second or two, after that I laughed! But I grumbled, I protested. As if it (<em>the body</em>) were telling me, "Why all these ‚Äî yes, why all these painful operations?" So I immediately gave myself a sound slap, saying to myself, "You are still full of vanity, you've got what you deserve!" Then it was over.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1492">But that's indeed the way it is and it's true, it's true, everything looks, oh, very serious, very difficult, very complicated, very ... while if we were less stupid, it could probably be very easy and swift! It's clearly because of our own stupidity, without a shadow of doubt.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1494">Just these last few days (because of all kinds of things ‚Äî people, and things that happen), I have been increasingly seeing that the human concept of divine Omnipotence is the concept of an omnipotence which would operate without rhyme or reason, through a succession of whims, any old how ‚Äî that's what people call "Omnipotence": being able to do the most stupid things at will.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1495">Obviously, that doesn't quite conform to a higher Harmony (!) Human beings are like that: if the god they worship or the divine they want to manifest isn't willing to do, to execute whatever comes into their heads in a totally incoherent and arbitrary way, he isn't all-powerful!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1496">I am exaggerating it to make it more perceptible; it's not like that: they deceive themselves (if you tell them that, they protest), but they deceive themselves, and it comes down to what I've just said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1497">When you succeed in going into that Consciousness of Harmony (but not an individual or local harmony), a Universal Harmony ‚Äî even ultra-universal, in which the universe is only one part ‚Äî then values change completely, completely....</p>

<p class="p-num">Page 203</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1499">All things are so simple and at the same time so COMPLEX....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1500">For instance, that relationship of simplicity (like that of a child) in which you very simply ask for the thing you feel the need for, but without mental complications; without explanations, without justifications, without all that useless farrago ‚Äî simply, "Oh, I would like ..." You have, for instance, quite a special feeling towards someone or something and you would like that someone or something to be perfectly harmonious, happy (which physically is expressed by good health or favourable circumstances), and so, spontaneously, simply, you say, "Oh!..." (you pray), "Oh, may it be like that!" And it happens. Then the thought (the general human thought): "This has happened, therefore it's the expression of the Truth." And it becomes a principle: "This is true, this is the way things should be." But up above, in that Consciousness ‚Äî that global Consciousness ‚Äî in that total Harmony, those things in themselves, in their material expression ("good health," "favourable circumstances") are of no more than minor importance, so to say, of almost nonexistent importance: things may be this way or that or this (they may be a hundred different ways), without its making any difference to the Harmony; but this particular way is chosen because of the simple, pure, candid beauty of the aspiration ‚Äî that is lovely, that is powerful in its simplicity. And, you know, without mental complication, without hypocrisy of any sort, without pretence of any sort: very simply, but from a luminous, pure, loving heart, without any egoism, "just like that." So that's a lovely light which has its place; and because of it, things may be this way or that (good health, favourable circumstances), it doesn't matter, it's unimportant. Human beings attach importance only to the external form, to what has manifested; they say, "Oh, this is true, since it is" ‚Äî and it's ... a passing breath of air. But the cause of it, its origin has a place in that total, universal Harmony: a disinterested goodwill, love devoid of egoism, trust that doesn't argue or reason, simplicity ‚Äî ingenious simplicity for which evil doesn't exist.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="85" href="#">4</a> If we could catch hold of that and keep it ...

And to our ordinary consciousness (I remember how it was in the past), that's what gives you the impression, "This is concrete, this is real." Well, "this," this sensation, is what must be replaced by the phenomenon of consciousness of that Pulsation. And That (<em>Mother makes an intense gesture encompassing her entire face</em>) is at the same time all-light, all-power, all-intensity of love, and such FULLNESS! It's so full that ... nothing else can exist but That, there too (<em>in Matter</em>). And when That is there, in the body, in the cells, it suffices to focus That on someone or something, and order is instantly restored.</p>

And it comes back, all those things come back like that, as if on a screen (but the screen of consciousness), and those that correspond to a reality come forward like an image, with the reality behind, so then it's very easy: you catch hold of the reality and it's over. But with many there's only the image and nothing behind! So how do you replace them?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1567">When it comes to languages, it's very interesting.... Those are things that come, stay for an hour or two, then go away; they are like lessons, things to be learned. And so, one day, there came the question of languages, of the different languages. Those languages were formed progressively (probably through usage, until, as you said, one day someone took it into his head to fix it in a logical and grammatical way), but behind those languages, there are identical experiences ‚Äî identical in their essence ‚Äî and there are certainly sounds that correspond to those experiences; you find those sounds in all languages, the different sounds with minor differences. One day (for a long time, more than an hour), it unfolded with all the evidence to support it, for all languages. Unfortunately, I couldn't see clearly, it was at night, so I couldn't note it down and it went away. But it should be able to come back. It was really interesting ... (<em>Mother tries to recall the experience.</em>) There were even languages I had never heard: I've heard many European languages; in India, several Indian languages, chiefly Sanskrit; and then, Japanese. And there were languages I had never heard. It was all there. And there were sounds, certain sounds that come from all the way up, sounds ... (how can I explain?), sounds we might call "essential." And I saw how they took shape and were distorted in languages (<em>Mother draws a sinuous descending line that branches out</em>). Sounds like the affirmative and the negative ‚Äî what, for us, is "yes" and "no" ‚Äî and also the expression of certain relationships (<em>Mother tries to remember</em>). But the interesting point was that it came with all the words, lots of words I didn't know! And at that time I knew them (it comes from a subconscient somewhere), I knew all those words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1568">At the same time, there was a sort of capacity or possibility, a state in which one was able to understand all languages; that is, every language was understood because of its connection with that region (<em>gesture to the heights, at the origin of sounds</em>). There didn't seem to be any difficulty in understanding any language. There was a sort of almost graphic explanation (<em>same sinuous descending line branching out</em>) showing how the sound had been distorted to express this or that or...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1571">Two or three days ago (this is part of the same field), I saw a baby girl who was born in America just while we were having the meditation here of 4.5.67. That child was born in America (of an Indian mother and an Indian father; the father was here, the mother there), and they brought her to me: a baby no bigger than this, microscopic! Her eyes were closed, a tiny thing: a little over two months old. The child was sleeping in her mother's arms, carried by her mother, her eyes closed, naturally. And ‚Äî plop! ‚Äî they put her in my lap without warning ‚Äî a tiny little thing like this. At first I stayed put, giving her time to adapt to the new vibration. She began stirring as if something was waking her up, probably the difference in the atmosphere. Then (<em>gesture of descent</em>) I immediately put the consciousness: the Consciousness, the Presence. And the child opened her two arms like this (<em>gesture like a Christ with arms outstretched</em>), she opened her eyes and looked ‚Äî such eyes! Magnificent with light, with consciousness, it was magnificent!... It lasted maybe a minute, not more, not even that long. Then she seemed to give a start, so I withdrew the Force because (<em>laughing</em>) I became wary. And she started wriggling and ... But that look and that gesture ‚Äî a gesture of ...

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1573">The eyes were magnificent, with such consciousness! With the joy of conscious aspiration ‚Äî it was magnificent. Then, afterwards, there was almost a sort of convulsion (it was too much, of course), so I withdrew the Force.</p>

In previous lives, for instance, there were moments when, for some reason or other, the psychic was present and took part, and so it keeps the memory of just one circumstance. But the memory it keeps is the PSYCHIC life of that moment; so even if it retains the memory of an image, it is a simplified image, translated in the psychic consciousness and according to the psychic vibration of all those present.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1590">Before I had the knowledge, before I met Th√©on and knew about those things, I had had memories that had always struck me because of their special character.... It was like having, not exactly an emotion, but a certain emotive vibration of a circumstance. And that's what is full, what remains and lasts. And along with that, you have a perception ‚Äî a bit vague, a bit fuzzy ‚Äî of the people who were there, of the circumstances, the events, and that makes up a psychic memory.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1593">I had many in Italy. I travelled in Italy with my mother when I was fifteen, and I had lived a past life in Italy which was very conscious. Upon seeing the places, that (<em>the psychic vibration of emotion</em>) would spring up suddenly. And it would come along with the image.... What's in the foreground is the psychic movement (the word "emotion" isn't good, but anyway), it's the psychic movement which is in front and is important ‚Äî that's what comes; the rest is like a background reflection: that is, forms, situations, circumstances.... I noted some down. Did you ever see something I wrote about a life in Italy? An old, old thing that I had written.... At fifteen ‚Äî I had that experience when I was fifteen. I don't even know where I put it away, I don't think that paper is with me, I don't know where it is.... I narrated it a little later. When I met Th√©on, I understood my experience because it was explained to me (I didn't say the thing, but I understood afterwards, once I knew the states of being, their working and all that), so I understood that was what a psychic memory was.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1594">Before I knew anything mentally, I had had a considerable number of memories from past lives, but in that way: real psychic memories, not mental fabrications. And what comes first is emotion ("emotion": the psychic feeling), it's vivid, strong, you know, very strong; then, as a sort of background setting, there are the forms, appearances, circumstances, with something like the quality of a nebulous memory, and they come along with the psychic feeling.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1595">I had that experience in Italy when I was fifteen, while travelling with my mother, and it struck me very much ‚Äî it was very striking indeed! It was the memory of having been strangled in the Doges' prison. Quite a story. Afterwards I enquired; I enquired about the names, the facts, the events (I was able to enquire in Italy about what had happened ‚Äî it was in Venice ‚Äî and it tallied marvellously). But the interesting thing, from an external point of view ... I was visiting the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 214</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1596"> entire <em>Palazzo ducale</em> with my mother and a group of travellers shown about by a guide: they take you underground, where the prisons were located. Then the guide started telling a story (which didn't interest me) when, all of a sudden, I was seized by a kind of force that came into me, and then, without even ‚Äî without even being aware of it, I went to a corner and saw a written word. It was ... But then, there came at the same time the memory that I had written it. And the whole scene came back: I was the one who had written that word on the wall (and I saw it, saw it with my physical eyes, the writing was still there; the guide said that all the walls with writings on them made by the Doges' prisoners had been kept intact). Then the scene went on: I saw, I had the sensation of people entering and catching hold of me (I was there with a prisoner ‚Äî I wasn't the prisoner: I was visiting him). I was there, and then some people came and seized me and ... (<em>gesture to the neck</em>) tied me up. And then (I was with a whole group of about ten people listening to the guide, near a small aperture opening onto the canal), then, the sensation of being lifted and thrown through that aperture.... Well, you understand, I was fifteen, so naturally...! I told my mother, "Let's get out of here!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1597">It was hard to restrain myself. We left.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1598">But afterwards I made enquiries, I questioned and researched (we had some family there,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="89" href="#">1</a> I knew some people), and I found out it was absolutely true. It was a true story, with the names and all (now it's all gone). A doge<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="90" href="#">2</a> had imprisoned his predecessor's son as a living danger to him, as he had tried to take his father's place. So the doge, who had taken the father's place, sent the son to prison. But the daughter of this doge was in love with the son, and she found a way to go and visit him. Then the doge, in his rage, decided to have her drowned. The whole story was there. And it was really spontaneous: I knew nothing of it (it's the kind of story they don't teach you in another country, they're known only locally).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1599">There you are, I found it very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1600">But the very interesting part was that thing which told me, "Over there." I went and saw, and found written on the wall precisely what I remembered having myself written.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1603">There was another experience I had a little later (a little later, around eighteen or nineteen), in which I suddenly found myself riding a horse, dressed as a man, leading armies to a fantastic victory; and it was the glory of the sense of the presence of the Force of Victory that made me lead the entire army to victory. Afterwards, I remembered the costume I was wearing, the people's costumes, everything, and ... I saw it was Murat's famous victory.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="91" href="#">3</a> I was... (how can I put it?) the victorious spirit in Murat. And ONLY THAT. So when people tell you, "I was this person, that person," it's all tales: they are forces, states of consciousness that manifested in certain individuals at certain moments in their lives and which, at such moments, touched Matter concretely. And all that is gathered, collected together little by little, gradually, until it produces a conscious being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1604">Now, this (<em>Mother's being</em>) is a rather special conscious being.... The psychic of this life (<em>laughing</em>) was rather collective!

But now that everything is being gathered together, it comes like that, like a part of the work, because ... the cells, when I had those visions, participated to some extent in the sense that they had the vibration in themselves; so all those vibrations have participated in the formation of all these cells, and now they relive it all. It gives them a possibility of breadth, of diversity, of synthesis and coordination of many, many things. And the sense of having thus lived for a long, long, long time.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1638">Just in these last few days I've had a series of experiences on that subject, very interesting experiences.... With the same person, whom I see every day, let's say, or very often, the impression of the contact (an impression that remains more or less) that depends on the presence of the psychic. With the same person, you understand, the same relationship, at certain times it becomes full and you have the sense of something ... yes, full ‚Äî not exactly "living," but ... (I can't say "solid" because there's nothing hard about it), but full, substantial; then, at other times, it's thin, fleeting, neutral. And I have observed (with the same people in the same circumstances), at times you have the sense of a ... more than living contact (the word "living" isn't enough), an EXISTENT contact, rather; an existent, durable contact (but not "durable" in time: durable in its nature); at other times with the very same people (often in the same circumstances), it's thin, flat, it's dry, superficial ‚Äî it may be very active, apparently very living, but it has no depth.... And I have seen that it is when the psychic participates and when it doesn't.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1639">So I have now reached the point where every minute I can feel ("feel," I don't mean perceive psychically, I mean feel materially) when the psychic is there and when it isn't. It's very interesting. These last few days.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1640">And it makes all the difference, in the sense that ... Well, it's like the difference between an image or a representation or a narration and the thing itself ‚Äî between an image and the thing itself, between the narration and the thing itself. That's the difference. With the one, it EXISTS; with the other, it may be living, but it's ... superficial and ... momentary. And as I said the other day, it doesn't at all depend on the importance of what you are doing (importance according to the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 219</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1641"> mental notion, of course), on the importance of what you are doing or the seriousness of the circumstance, none of all that: simply, the psychic is there or it isn't. That's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1642">Which amounts to saying that the CELLS THEMSELVES feel the difference, perceive the difference.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1643">I don't remember, because I don't note those things mentally, but it's an experience I have had with someone I see very often (maybe every day, I don't know, I forget who). One day, for a time, the impression of an existent relationship, full and ... You could call it "comfortable," with a sense of security; the same person in the same circumstances: suddenly like an image of himself: hollow (very alive and mentally active), but hollow and dry, indifferent ‚Äî nonexistent, so to say.</p>

But it's still a completely new field ‚Äî new from that total, integral angle. Formerly, everything going on in the body (I don't mean this one, I mean it in a general way) was a reflection and an effect of the "Thing," while now, it is the Thing itself. But the millennial habit of being otherwise is so strong that the impression is ... It's like ... (the comparison is poor, but anyway), like stretching a rubber band; so as long as you keep it stretched (<em>gesture of effort, pulling on Matter</em>), the effect is there; but if the tension ceases, even for a second (<em>gesture of abrupt flattening</em>), it falls back out of habit....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1670"> Which compels you to constant tension. But it won't always be like that. It is the transition from one habit to another; once the other movement is established, then it will be natural, this constant tension won't be necessary.</p>

While if you are grave, serious, see all the human misery, and put it into thick, ponderous sounds, and, oh, if it's made into orchestral music that bores you stiff ... (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1694">Wait, there's something else again.... Oh, poor K., he held examinations (they're out of their minds with their exams!), he held examinations on a text or a subject he had dictated to the students in his class. In other words, they had the answer quite ready. Two of the boys (one of whom K. finds very intelligent ‚Äî he is, moreover ‚Äî and has a liking for, while he doesn't like the other) were late, and K. asked the boy he doesn't like to bring to him at home the result of their work. He brought it. K. read it, and to one of the questions, the two boys' answers were not quite identical but extremely similar. It was precisely the subject K. had dictated to them, so it was natural enough that the answers should be similar. K. "felt" right away that the boy had copied from the other, and told him so! The boy lost his temper and spoke to him rather rudely. So K. writes to tell me the whole story in his own way, and the boy writes to tell me the whole story, in his own way, moreover expressing regret that he was rude to his teacher. But K. remains convinced that he copied. So, a flood of letters ... Finally I wrote to K., "Send me the two texts, I will see" (not "see" with my eyes, but like that, "feeling" the thing). The boy did NOT copy. But to me, it's far worse, because it means K. made a mental formation with words ‚Äî words put in a certain order ‚Äî and stuffed it into their brains. And they repeat it parrot fashion ‚Äî naturally, it bears an extraordinary similarity to his teaching. Finally, K. told me, "If I accept that the boy didn't copy, I am obliged to give him a very good mark, which I can't do!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) And he asks me, "What should I do?" I replied yesterday evening: "There is a very simple way out: cancel the exam. Take all the papers, tie them into a bundle, put them away in your cupboard, and pretend it never existed ‚Äî and in future, no more exams! And at the end of the year, when you have to give marks to the students, well, instead of using such an artificial</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 224</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1695"> method, you will be obliged to observe attentively, follow the child's inner development, have a deeper contact with him (<em>Mother laughs mockingly</em>), and know if he has really understood or not! Then you will be able to give marks instead of basing yourself on the parrot-like repetition of something they have learned without understanding." And I sent that. So now, they're in a fix! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) I find it so funny, it's very amusing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1696">They had to hold a "teachers' meeting" to face up to my answer! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) I upset the whole School!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1697">One of the teachers has already answered me, "It's impossible to know the students' progress unless exams are taken." To this I didn't exactly reply what I thought, but I thought: of course, if the teacher is an idiot, he can't judge the students' progress unless he makes them take exams, but if he is an intelligent man with a psychic sense, there are a thousand ways to find out if a student has understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1698">So they've had their meeting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1699"><em>But from the technical standpoint, it's more difficult to judge progress.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1700">Ah, yes, that's what they base themselves on. But it makes no difference! Two of the teachers of technology have shown how, from the purely technical standpoint, it was possible to evaluate without the need for exams. No, you see, I know, I did my studies there, in France, there were lots of exams and I know how it is. I attended (I was young at the time, but that makes no difference), I attended exams like the ones taken for certificates, I saw the pupils who were there, I saw how they answered.... It's one of my very concrete experiences: the ones that pass are NOT AT ALL the most intelligent ones! Never. They are the ones that repeat parrot fashion. They repeat very nicely.

</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1746">We could call our world "the world of bad habits."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1747">There has been for some time, I don't know, a sort of benevolent, smiling and ... constructive irony. As if a "spirit" had come. Then, there is something else (but I know that one), which Sri Aurobindo used to call <em>a censor</em>. He told me, "<em>You have a very strong censor in your atmosphere.</em>" It was all the time, constantly criticizing me; not so often now, but it's still there. And now and then, it tells me, "But you shock people! They expect something noble, great, imposing, and you always speak in an ironic tone!" Yesterday again, some people came to see me ‚Äî and jokes keep coming to me all the time. I tell them jokes, and I watch ... (<em>laughing</em>) they look appalled!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1748">As if that was constantly saying, "But don't take things seriously!... Don't take things seriously, don't take things seriously ... that's what makes you unhappy! That's what makes you unhappy, it makes you unhappy, you must learn to smile," like that. And above all, to make fun of ourselves, that's the most important thing: to see how ridiculous we are ‚Äî the slightest pain and we are full of self-pity, oh!...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1749">At times one protests....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1750">It's a very odd atmosphere, and amusing. But it's a very good cure for that inveterate illness which is <em>self-pity</em>. The body is full of it, it pities itself as soon as there is the slightest trouble ‚Äî and that aggravates it terribly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1751">And then, what goings-on ... The goings-on at the School, oh, those are ... priceless stories! But yesterday evening, I suddenly became indignant about a boy, the boy who had been accused of copying. He asserted he hadn't copied, and I saw he hadn't (but what I saw was almost worse!), and I said, "No more exams" ‚Äî a dreadful row everywhere! Then K., who is really a good boy, wrote to me, "Should I not rather tell the boy that you decided he hadn't copied, because he must be worrying?" I thought, "Poor K.!" But anyway, it was a nice gesture, so I said yes. Then he called the boy, told him what he had to, also that exams were abolished and the whole matter was over and done with. As soon as the boy left him, he went and told his friends a world of lies: that I had asked K. to apologize, to express regret and reinstate the boy, and a lot of fibs ... a series of terrible lies (and lies about me). You understand, I had had a movement of sympathy for K. for what he had done; it shows a sort of nobleness of soul in him: he was so convinced, but he accepted what I said and made that gesture because he thought the boy must have been worrying. Then</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1752"> the boy's thoroughly disgusting reaction ... I had to restrain myself (inwardly): I was displeased.

Yesterday, I was on the point of giving the child an inner slap ‚Äî I stopped myself from doing so, but he has clearly put himself in a bad spot.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1753">Now they write to ask me, "How can we know whether the children follow if we don't have exams?" I had to explain the difference between a type of individual control based on observation, on a remark, on an unexpected question, etc., which allows the teacher to situate the child, and the other method in which you are forewarned, "You will have an exam in eight days and the subject will be on what you have learned" ‚Äî so everyone starts revising what he has learned and preparing himself, and that's that: the one with a good memory is the one who passes. I have explained all that.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="99" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1754"><em>If I had been a teacher, my objection to this decision would not at all have been from the teachers' point of view, but from the students' because I remember my studies, and if there had not been an obligation every three or six months to revise what was learned in class, well, you know, one would have just let it go.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1760"> things.... The teachers' point of view is to have as easy a control as possible and to be able to give marks without giving themselves too much trouble, with a minimum of effort. As for me, I say: each student is an individuality, each student should come not because he wants to be able to say, "I have studied and I am going to take my exams," but because he is eager to know and he comes with the will to know. And the teacher must not follow the easy method of giving a subject and seeing how each one answers, and whether the answer is good or bad, and conforms to what he has taught or not: he must find out whether the student's interest and effort are sincere, and everyone according to his own nature ‚Äî for the teacher it's infinitely more difficult, but that's education. And they protest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1761"><em>As regards the teachers' point of view, I certainly agree entirely ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1762">Yes, but they are the ones who protest! (<em>Laughing</em>) The students don't protest. But I wrote to the teachers: the students who want to please their teacher or who learn by heart in order to seem to know what they haven't understood, well, those students aren't interesting ‚Äî and they are always the ones about whom I am told, "He is a good student!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1763">But you know, I remember, I clearly remember my attitude when I was studying, and I clearly remember all my classmates and which one was to me an intelligent girl, which one was a chatterbox.... I have some very amusing memories about that, because I couldn't understand what meaning there was in learning in order to seem to know (I had a tremendous memory at the time, but didn't make use of it). And I liked only what I had understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1764">Once in my life I took an exam (I forget which one), but I was just at the age limit, that is I was too young to sit at the time of the regular exam, so they had me sit with those who had flunked the first exam (I sat at that time because it was autumn, and then I was old enough). And I remember, we were a small group, the teachers were greatly annoyed because their holidays had been cut short, and the students were for the most part rather mediocre, or else rebellious. There I was, observing all that (I was very young, you understand, I don't remember how old, thirteen or fourteen), observing the whole thing: a poor little girl had been called to the blackboard to do a mathematical problem, and she didn't know how to do it, she kept stammering. Me (I wasn't being questioned just then), I looked and smiled ‚Äî oh, dear! The teacher saw me and was quite displeased. As soon as the girl was sent back, he called me and said, "You do it."</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 233</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1765"> Well, naturally (I loved mathematics very much, really very much, and also I understood, it made sense), I did the problem ‚Äî the chap's face!... You see, I wasn't in that (<em>in the small outward person</em>): I was constantly a witness. And I had the most extraordinary fun. So I know the way children are, the way teachers are, I know all that, I had great fun, really great fun.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1766">At home, my brother was studying advanced mathematics (it was to enter <em>Polytechnique</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="100" href="#">2</a>), and he found it difficult, so my mother had engaged a tutor to coach him. I was two years younger than my brother. I used to look on, and everything would become clear: the why, the how, it all was clear. So the teacher was working hard, my brother was working hard, when suddenly I said, "But it's like this!" Then I saw the teacher's face!... It seems he went and told my mother, "It's your daughter who should be learning!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) And it was all like a picture, you understand, so funny, so funny! So I know, I remember, I know the reactions, the habits.... That's why I didn't want to look after the School here because I thought it would be a headache and everyone would fall on me! Then I was forced to because of that copying affair. But now I find it funny! (<em>Laughing</em>) And I tell them outrageous things!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1767">It's so amusing, so amusing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1768">For a time I attended a private school: I didn't go to a state school because my mother considered it unfitting for a girl to be in a state school! But I was in a private school, a school of high repute at the time: their teachers were really capable people. The geography teacher, a man of renown, had written books, his books on geography were well-known. He was a fine man. So then, we were doing geography (I enjoyed maps more fully because it all had to be drawn) and one day, the teacher looked at me (he was an intelligent man), he looked at me and asked, "Why are towns, the big cities, settled on rivers?" I saw the students' bewildered look, they were saying to themselves, "Lucky the question wasn't put to me!" I replied, "But it's very simple! It's because rivers are a natural means of communication." (<em>Mother laughs</em>) He too was taken aback!... That's how it was, all my studies were like that, I enjoyed myself all the time ‚Äî enjoyed myself thoroughly, it was great fun!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1769">The teacher of literature ... He was an old fellow full of all the most conventional ideas imaginable. What a bore he was, oh!... So all the students sat there, their noses to the grindstone. He would give subjects for essays ‚Äî do you know <em>The Path of Later On and the Road of Tomorrow?</em> I wrote it when I was twelve, it was my homework on</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 234</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1770"> his question! He had given a proverb (now I forget the words) and expected to be told ... all the sensible things! I told my story, that little story, it was written at the age of twelve. Afterwards he would eye me with misgivings! (<em>Laughing</em>) He expected me to make a scene.... Oh, but I was a good girl!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1771">But it was always like that: with that something looking on and seeing the sheer ridiculousness of this life which takes itself so seriously!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1772">All those things have come back these last few days, because of this affair.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1773">I can recall only one instance when I took things seriously, and even then (laughing), I put on a serious LOOK. It involved my brother, who was still quite young (my brother must have been twelve, or less: ten, and I eight ‚Äî no, nine and eleven, something like that, mere children). My brother was quick-tempered, he was easily angered and would speak very bluntly, almost harshly. One day he talked back to my father (I forget about what); my father was furious and put him across his knees (my father was an extremely strong man, I mean physically strong), he put my brother across his knees and ... (<em>laughing</em>) started spanking him; he had pulled his pants down and was spanking him. I enter and see that (it was taking place in the dining room), I see that, see my father, look at him, and say to myself, "But this man is mad!" And I told him, "You stop at once, or I'm leaving this house." (I was two years younger than my brother.) And I said it with such seriousness, oh! And I was resolute. And my father ... (<em>laughing</em>) was flabbergasted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1774">All those memories have come back like that. So now I remember to what extent ‚Äî to what extent the consciousness was already there. But it was amusing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1775" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1776">And the ease: whatever I wanted to do I could do. But there was one thing (now I understand, at the time I didn't know why it was so): whatever I wanted to do I could do, but after a time, I had experienced the thing and it didn't seem to me important enough to devote a whole life to it. So I would move on to something else: painting, music, science, literature... everything, and also practical things. And always with extraordinary ease. Then, after a while, very well, I would leave it. So my mother (she was a very stern person) would say, "My daughter is incapable of seeing anything through to the end." And it remained like that: incapable of seeing anything through to the end ‚Äî always taking to something, then leaving it, then</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 235</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1777"> after a time taking to something else.... "Unstable. Unstable ‚Äî she will never achieve anything in life!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1778">And it was really the childlike transcription of the need for ever more, ever better, ever more, ever better ... endlessly ‚Äî the sense of advancing, advancing towards perfection. A perfection that I felt to be quite beyond anything people thought of ‚Äî something ... a "something" ... which was indefinable, but which I sought through everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1779">So all that has come back to be sorted out, put in its place, offered (<em>gesture upward</em>), and now, it's over.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1781">Anyway, thanks to that, probably because that note was published, things have been brought back into the atmosphere, and this morning there was a very, very concrete experience somewhere....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1782">It's a strange thing, it's as if you suddenly emerge from a conventional atmosphere of thought, which is like a terrestrial atmosphere (I don't mean it's an ordinary thought, I mean it's in the field of human mentality), and then there is, above, something that sees things quite differently. As if ... Yes, things are ordinarily seen like this (<em>gesture from below upward</em>), while "that" sees like this (<em>gesture from above downward</em>), so when you enter there, you see things that you know here (you know them, they aren't new), but you see them with a totally different look. And naturally, the notation is also done differently.... (<em>Mother looks for a note</em>)</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 236</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1783">It came in two ways. Those things are SEEN, you understand, seen. Words come afterwards to try and transcribe what was seen. The first thing that came was thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1784">"Christians divinize suffering to make it a means of the earth's salvation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1785">Then it came with just a small difference ‚Äî these are subtleties, but ... From an intellectual standpoint, these are subtleties without value, but up there you seem to be almost touching the heart of things, that is, the essence ‚Äî the deeper essence of events. So then, it came quite simply, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1786">"Christianity DEIFIES suffering to make it the instrument of the earth's salvation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1787">It's hard to explain because it's the state of consciousness that is different.... Now it's a memory, but at that moment it was a vision ‚Äî a very, very deep vision, very sharp, naturally exceeding all that occurred on earth, but also all the ways of expressing what occurred. The personality of Christ and so on ‚Äî it was all so different! And it became, yes, I might say symbolic, but that's not it.... At the same time, it placed this religion among all the others, in a very defined place in the earth evolution ‚Äî in the evolution of the earth CONSCIOUSNESS.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1788">The experience lasted for half an hour, but everything, everything was different ‚Äî different not in its appearance, different in its deeper significance.... Was the difference in my active consciousness? I don't know. I mean, did I make contact with a region of consciousness that was new to me? Possibly. But it seemed to me a wholly different vision of the earth and man's history.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1789">During the experience I remembered what Sri Aurobindo had written: "Men love suffering, therefore Christ still hangs on the cross in Jerusalem."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="102" href="#">2</a> And that was like ... (<em>smiling</em>) a sort of froth of thought quite on the surface, all the way up, bathed in the light from above, and like the intellectual way of expressing what I was seeing (<em>gesture from above downward</em>), which came from above.... From the point of view of light, it was a very interesting experience.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 237</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1790"><em>And seen from above, what was the story like?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1791">You see, Sri Aurobindo says, "Man loves suffering, therefore Christ still hangs on the cross in Jerusalem," then I said, Christianity (I mean the universal, or anyway terrestrial, origin of what expressed itself on earth as the Christian religion), the action of this religion on earth has been to "deify suffering" because it was NECESSARY for men to understand ‚Äî not only to understand but to feel and adhere to the raison d'√™tre (the universal raison d'√™tre) of suffering on earth as a means of evolution. Basically, we could say that they sanctified suffering so it may be recognized as a means indispensable to the evolution of the earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1792">So now, that action has been exploited to the full and more, and ought to be gone beyond, and that's why it must be left behind in order to find something else.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1793"><em>You also said once, "It is not a crucified but a glorified body that will save the world."<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="103" href="#">3</a></em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1794">Yes. Then a Christian sent me a picture of Christ on the cross, and just above, the risen Christ in his ascent heavenward ‚Äî that's how they take it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1795"><em>It all happens on the heights.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1796">Yes, heavenward.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1797" style="text-align: right;">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1798">Have you sometimes had that kind of very global vision in time and space, in which each thing has its place and everything is coordinated by a total consciousness?... (It must be new only to me.) It is a knowledge-vision. My consciousness, the consciousness there (<em>gesture above and around</em>) is constantly a consciousness of action. Since the beginning of those creative bursts of Love, it has been a consciousness of action, always action ‚Äî action, action, perpetual action. In fact, constant creation. But this morning, it wasn't action: it was (<em>laughing</em>) the "observation," I could say, the observation of that action as a sort of vision, as you would look at a picture, you know. Instead of being on the highest intellectual plane, that of absolute comprehension and that puts each thing in its place, it was ... (how can I explain it?). It's a knowledge through subjective vision. Not the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 238</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1799"> vision of something foreign to you: it's the same state of consciousness as that of the doer, but instead of only doing, it sees at the same time. That was this morning's experience. It was rather new in the sense that I only had it now and then, like that, but never with that totality, that clarity and that sort of absoluteness. It is the sensation of a self-evident, absolute, indisputable knowledge ‚Äî it's not "trying to express something": it's SEEING. Seeing, really seeing, but seeing ... not one thing after another: seeing everything at once, a totality in space and in time. And seeing every detail with total precision, which makes it possible to write a thing like this (<em>the note on Christianity</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1800">To be clear, I should tell the whole thing. Yesterday I had an opportunity to speak to someone about this constant presence of Sri Aurobindo, here, who sees, says, does, all the time. Then, after I had spoken, I wondered, "How is it that this brain ..." Because, I think I told you, when Sri Aurobindo left his body, several times, several days in a row, I stood near his bed for one or two hours, and I felt ‚Äî MATERIALLY felt ‚Äî what came out of his body enter mine. To such a point that I remember having said, "Well, if anyone denies afterlife, I have proof it exists." So I thought, "Why does this brain (<em>Mother's</em>) go on working according to its usual routine now that the consciousness of the Presence is constant?" Then this morning I had this experience, and while having the experience, I felt, "This is how Sri Aurobindo used to see!" (<em>Laughing</em>) That must be it!... And for some time I have noticed that as soon as, for this body or for other bodies, for events, for ... as soon as something is formulated (it's neither a desire nor an aspiration, but something like the living perception of a possibility that SHOULD be realized ‚Äî it comes sometimes), it gets done! It gets done automatically and immediately. So this morning, for, oh, half an hour, the impression was so charming, so pleasant: "Ah, there we are! THIS IS HOW we should see things!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1801">Afterwards I had to be busy with other things, but it's there. And the question was, "Why? Why isn't there in this brain the capacity to perceive and transcribe things ... as he had it?"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1802">And so the conclusion. I've always heard it said (I don't know if it's true) that men think in a certain way and women in another. On an external level, the difference is not visible, but the attitude ‚Äî the mental attitude ‚Äî is perhaps different. The mental attitude on the <em>Prakriti</em> side is always action, always action; the mental attitude on the <em>Purusha</em><a class="fn-ref" data-fn="104" href="#">4</a> side is conception: conception, overall vision, and</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 239</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1803"> also observation, as though it observed what the Prakriti had done and saw how it was done. Now I understand that. That's how it is. Naturally, no man (here on earth) is exclusively masculine and no woman is exclusively feminine, because it has all been mixed together again and again. Similarly, I don't think any one race is absolutely pure: all that is over, it's been mingled together (it is another way to re-create Oneness). But there have been TENDENCIES; It's like that note about Israelites and Muslims, it's just a manner of speaking; if I were told, "This is what you said," I would reply, "Yes, I said that, but I can also say something else and many other things!" It's a way of selecting certain things and bringing them to the fore with an action in view (it's always with an action in view). But for the moment, everything is like that, everywhere mixed and mingled together with a view to general unification ‚Äî no one nationality is pure and separate from the others, that no longer exists. But to a certain vision, each thing has its essential role, its raison d'√™tre, its place in universal history. It's like that very strong impression that the Chinese are lunar, that when the moon grew cold, some beings managed to come to the earth, and those beings are at the origin of the Chinese nation; but now there only remains a trace ‚Äî a trace which is the memory of that distinctiveness. And it's everywhere the same thing: if you look at the individuals of every nation, you find in every nation that everything is there, but with the memory ... the memory of a specificness which has been its raison d'√™tre in the great terrestrial unfolding.</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Regarding a Tantric apprentice, disciple of X.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1809">Do you see W?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1810"><em>Yes, I saw him yesterday.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1811">He wrote to me today: he is in full revolt. What did he tell you yesterday?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1812"><em>Oh!...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1813">He was not too good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1814"><em>No, not at all.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1815">In full revolt. So at night, his heart pains, his chest pains, his head pains ‚Äî pains all over. And today he writes to tell me, "Is this what you want till doomsday?" I wrote back, "What I want is just the opposite!"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1816">I saw him yesterday and spoke to him for half an hour, but he was like... you know, like iron bars; he had decided in advance that he wouldn't understand anything of what I would tell him. I tried to enter deep down, but ... He told me (it's an old formation on him) that whatever he wants to do he does for a while, then he meets with disaster and the thing is stopped. And he says that now he is making his spiritual effort, and he has met with disaster (I don't know which one). Naturally, I told him it wasn't like that at all! That it was on the contrary the sign he had reached the point when the door could open and he could transform himself. But he refused to understand. You know, when people are obdurate like that, there's no way you can get through.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1817">So I thought you could perhaps talk to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1818"><em>I saw him yesterday and felt it did him good, or at any rate that he listened to me....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1819">I also felt (that's why I mention it) that he would listen to you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1820"><em>Yes, I am trying.</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 244</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1821">Then and good.... You know, when you dress iron bars like that and you say, "It's impossible, impossible, impossible"...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1822"><em>The difficult problem for him now is, at bottom, all this Tantric japa he does.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1823">But why does he go on?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1824"><em>Well, that's just the problem, he can't find the strength to break off.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1825">Ah, that's it: he goes on....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1826"><em>Yesterday I tried to tell him that this kind of discipline is very powerful and good for some, but that in fact, it's like weaving a force around yourself more and more, in which you shut yourself in.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1827">That's right. Yes, exactly!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1828"><em>But he must find the courage to break off. That's his problem.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1829">He hasn't once told me, "I want to stop."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1830"><em>But that's because he doesn't dare. And you don't tell him to either, so ... (But of course, it's difficult for you to tell him.)</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1831">Yesterday I explained to him the effect that this japa had on him, I explained in detail, but I don't think he understood anything. And I told him to change; I even gave him the Mantra (because if you do that it is the supreme liberation). Instead of leaving him without anything at all, I wanted him in fact, to do that. But yesterday when I asked him, "Are you going on with your japa?" he said, "Oh, just a little."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1832">Actually, there are, inside oneself naturally (and consequently around oneself), forces that oppose one's realization, and the system of those [Tantric] mantras is to look for the support of those Overmind beings against those forces, which are much more powerful than they (the gods) ‚Äî the proof is that despite all their goodwill, they (<em>the Overmind gods</em>) have never been able to make the earth a harmonious place. We can't help noting the fact. So I told him it was a direct fight, all those mantras are a direct fight against the difficulty, whereas ... (and that's what gave him the terrible headache he complains about: it's dangerous, of course, it can unsettle the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 245</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1833"> whole functioning). I told him to stop and use that (<em>Mother's Mantra</em>). I explained it all to him yesterday. I told him he shouldn't wage a direct fight: one must try to find the support in the force one has inside oneself, which is everywhere and can overcome the difficulty: "Instead of fighting, live in the other consciousness." But I saw he was closed ‚Äî locked in ‚Äî with a hard look. He didn't want to understand. So ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1834">For half an hour he kept me here. It was half past twelve!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1835">So if you explain that to him, I think it will do him good.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1836"><em>Yesterday evening, it got through to him, I touched something.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1837">Certainly!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1838"><em>But...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1839">So the result: he told me this morning, "I couldn't sleep the whole night, my heart pains, a pain somewhere else" (in three or four places), "I can't eat, impossible" ‚Äî well, a most tragic picture, and asking me, "Do you want me to be like this till doomsday?"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1840"><em>His problem is to break off from that Tantric business.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1841">No, there are two problems. There is that one on the level of action, and then there is a tre-men-dous pride in the whole family; a terrible pride, it's a formation.... That's what was in him yesterday, as if coagulated. So I told him, "Have a little more humility, a little more modesty."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1842">One doesn't want to abdicate, you understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1843">It's the sense of being nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing when you are in front of ... call "that" what you will, it doesn't matter (one may start from the idea of consciousness and go up to the Supreme Lord, it doesn't matter). But it's the concrete feeling that as long as you want to remain shut in your little person, you are nothing, while if you abdicate that little person, you become everything. That's what they don't understand. Pride is simply ... You have a contact with inner eternity, inner omnipotence, but you are shut in your little ego, so the ego imagines itself to be That, and then it asserts itself ‚Äî sits down and refuses to budge: a colossal I. It's precisely the supreme Truth (<em>laughing</em>) in its deformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1844">I tried to make him understand that yesterday, but not like that, I put it very nicely!</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 246</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1845">One certainly sees that: with those who are the very opposite, who grovel on the ground, there is no stuff, you can't do anything with them; so you have to try and give them a little self-confidence. But that's nothing. While with those others you can do something, but ... oh, they become furious with you!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1846">The contact with the great Asuras, the first Asuras, is like that: the full consciousness of their formidable power, their marvellous capacities ‚Äî they forget one thing, it's that they deserve no credit for it, it's not their exclusive property! So they cut the connection and become instruments of disorder and confusion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1847">This one, the Lord of Falsehood....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1848">To the human consciousness, those things are terrible, but seen from up above, they make you smile. I remember, when I met him during the war (I had ruined his work with Hitler, then I met him), I told him, "You know quite well that your time is over." He said, "I know it, but until I disappear I will wreak as much havoc as I can."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1852">"Your difficulty comes from the fact that you have still the old belief that in life, there are some things high and some things low. It is not exact.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1862"><em>A little later, following a meditation:</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1863">That's how it is. Day after day, almost hour after hour, as the Power comes back ... You remember, I once said it had gone completely,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="105" href="#">1</a> and that was true, it had gone completely in order to leave the body absolutely to itself, for its conversion, we could say; but once there had been in this body consciousness the same aspiration and the same ardour of consciousness (with a far greater steadiness than in any other part of the being; there are no fluctuations as there are</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 248</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1864"> in the vital and mind, it's very steady), once that was established (through kinds of pulsations, not distant from one another, first on one detail, then spreading out and becoming generalized), since then the Power has been ... I can say it has been coming back. But at each stage of that return, all the old difficulties appear to be waking up again,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="106" href="#">2</a> they seem to spring up again (they had completely fallen asleep, you understand), and each time, this body consciousness feels a sort of surprise, at once astonished and distressed that the presence of the divine Power, the divine Consciousness, the Truth-Consciousness, should give rise to all those difficulties, which are essentially difficulties of ignorance and inertia ‚Äî the incapacity to receive. And it comes back as memories, like that (<em>gesture from below</em>), like a snake rearing its head. And every time, everything in the physical consciousness has the same call, "Why? How can these things be when You are there!" That's the astonishing thing: "Since You are there, how can these things be?"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1865">Till now, in the majority of cases, this has signalled a conversion, a transformation, an illumination (depending on the case), but this case we were just talking about (<em>the Tantric apprentice</em>) came precisely as a result of that return of the Power (I knew it; he told me yesterday, but I knew it when he had his revolt). And all that came was just all the old revolts, all the old movements, which were previously so strong, so widespread, so ESTABLISHED, and had been as though halted in their expression by the withdrawal of the Power. So everyone was slumbering in his condition. Then, as soon as the Force started coming back and working again, it all woke up.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1866">But it's not the full Presence yet, not the complete Presence of the being, which, through an incontrovertible omnipotence, changes things. And then, the body, with something so very moving in the simplicity of its prayer and its childlike astonishment, asks, "Since You are there, how can that be?..." And all that is ready to be transformed is transformed. But it isn't yet ... (how can I explain?) the compelling thing (<em>gesture of irresistible descent</em>), the absolute authority that nothing can resist ‚Äî it's not that, not yet, far from it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1871">The interesting point is that this body spontaneously, immediately and effortlessly ‚Äî spontaneously ‚Äî tries to find in itself, in the body's cells (it's a whole WORLD!

Like that. And always the same answer, "Give everything, give everything, give everything....

<p class="Ps">(<em>Mother comes across the note she wrote on Christianity and commented on July 29</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1906">"Christianity deifies suffering to make it the instrument of the earth's salvation."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1907">You know, it came to me as a discovery.... The whole religion, instead of being seen like this (<em>gesture from below</em>), was seen like that (<em>gesture from above</em>).... Here is what I mean: the ordinary idea of Christianity is that the son (to use their language), the "son of God" came to give his message (a message of love, unity, fraternity and charity) to the earth; and the earth, that is, those who govern, who weren't ready, sacrificed him, and his "Father," the supreme Lord, let him be sacrificed in order that his sacrifice would have the power to save the world. That is how they see Christianity, in it's most comprehensive idea ‚Äî the vast majority of Christians don't understand anything whatsoever, but I mean that among them there</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 253</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1908"> may be (perhaps, it's possible), among the cardinals for instance who have studied occultism and the deeper symbols of things, some who understand a little better ... anyway. But according to my vision (<em>Mother points to her note on Christianity</em>), what happened was that in the history of the evolution of the earth, when the human race, the human species, began to question and rebel against suffering, which was a necessity to emerge more consciously from inertia (it's very clear in animals, it has become very clear already: suffering was the means to make them emerge from inertia), but man, on the other hand, went beyond that stage and began to rebel against suffering, naturally also to revolt against the Power that permits and perhaps uses (perhaps uses, to his mind) this suffering as a means of domination. So that is the place of Christianity.... There was already before it a fairly long earth history ‚Äî we shouldn't forget that before Christianity, there was Hinduism, which accepted that everything, including destruction, suffering, death and all calamities, are part of the one Divine, the one God (it's the image of the Gita, the God who "swallows" the world and its creatures). There is that, here in India. There was the Buddha, who on the other hand, was horrified by suffering in all its forms, decay in all its forms, and the impermanence of all things, and in trying to find a remedy, concluded that the only true remedy is the disappearance of the creation.... Such was the terrestrial situation when Christianity arrived. So there had been a whole period before it, and a great number of people beginning to rebel against suffering and wanting to escape from it like that. Others deified it and thus bore it as an inescapable calamity. Then came the necessity to bring down on earth the concept of a deified, divine suffering, a divine suffering as the supreme means to make the whole human consciousness emerge from Unconsciousness and Ignorance and lead it towards its realization of divine beatitude, but not ‚Äî not by refusing to collaborate with life, but IN life itself: accepting suffering (the crucifixion) in life itself as a means of transformation in order to lead human beings and the entire creation to its divine Origin.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1909">That gives a place to all religions in the development from the Inconscient to the divine Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1910">It isn't simply a little remark noted down in passing: it's a vision. One can always present it as something conceived mentally, but it's not that; it's not that, but it was, if you like, a necessity in the development. And that PLACES things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1911">Islam was a return towards sensation, beauty, harmony in the form, and the legitimization of sensations and joy in beauty. From a higher viewpoint, it wasn't of a very superior quality, but from a</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 254</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1912"> vital viewpoint, it was extremely powerful, and that's what gave them so much power to spread, to appropriate, to seize, to dominate. But what they did is very beautiful ‚Äî all their art is magnificent, magnificent! It was a flowering of beauty.... Then there were others ‚Äî it all came one after the other. And every religion came as a stage in the development and the relationship with the Divine, to lead the consciousness towards a union which is a totality and not a removal from a whole reality so as to obtain another. The need for totality, completeness, is what caused those religions to come like that, one after another.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1913">Seen in that light, it's very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1914">Instead of looking at it from below, there was all of a sudden an overall vision from right above of how it was all organized with such a clear consciousness, such a clear will, each thing coming just when it was necessary so nothing would be overlooked and everything might come out, emerge from that Unconsciousness, and become increasingly conscious.... And so, in this immense history, the earth history, Christianity finds its place ‚Äî its legitimate place. That has a double advantage: for those who despise it its value is restored, and as for those who believe it's the unique truth, they are made to see that it's only one element among others in the whole. There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1915">That's why I found it interesting ‚Äî because it was the result of a vision, and that vision came because I started concerning myself with religions (started again, to tell the truth, because I was very familiar with that subject in the past). And when I was asked questions on the Israelites and the Muslims, I looked and said, "Here is their place. Here is their place and their raison d'√™tre." Then, one day I said to myself, "Well, it is true! Seen in that way, it's obvious: Christianity is like a rehabilitation of suffering as a means of development of the consciousness."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1916">And so Sri Aurobindo's sentence assumes its full value.... Christianity came because men were rebelling against pain and trying to escape from the world in order to escape from pain.... Then, as the years went by and with the unfolding, men took a liking to suffering! And because they love it (see how Sri Aurobindo's sentence becomes clear), "Christ still hangs on the cross in Jerusalem." It assumes its full significance.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1930">Oh....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1931">Do you know, I sat down, when it was nearly time, maybe half a minute before, and instantly, without warning like that, like a staggering blow: such a powerful descent (I was completely immobilised) of something.... At the same time, it was as if Sri Aurobindo was telling me (because the definition came along with the "thing" ‚Äî it was a vision which wasn't a vision, which was absolutely concrete), and the word was: <em>golden peace</em>. But so strong! And it didn't budge at all. For the entire half-hour it didn't budge. Never before... It's something new, I had never felt that before. I can't say.... It was perceived, but not like an objective vision. And other people spontaneously told me that as soon as they sat down for the meditation (<em>gesture of a massive descent</em>), something came with a tremendous power and immobilised everything, with a sense of peace as they had never felt before in their life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1932"><em>Golden peace...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1933">And indeed it gave a sense of the golden supramental light, but it was ... such a peace! A solid peace, you know, not the negation of disorder and activity, no: solid, a solid peace. I didn't want to stop: they sounded the gong, but I stayed on for two or three minutes. When I did stop, it withdrew. And it made such a difference for the body ‚Äî the body itself ‚Äî such a difference that when the experience went away I felt a great uneasiness and it took me half a minute to find my balance again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1934">It came and then withdrew. It came for the meditation, then withdrew. For more than half an hour: thirty-five minutes.</p>

And when I came out, there arose from that whole crowd a sort</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1937"> of ... something in between an entreaty, a prayer and a protest, for the world's condition, and particularly the country's. And it rose up in waves.... I looked at it (it was extremely insistent), then said to myself, "Today isn't my day, it's Sri Aurobindo's day," and I did like this (<em>gesture of withdrawal</em>) and put Sri Aurobindo in front. Then, when he came to the fore, while bringing himself to the fore, he simply said, very simply, <em>"The Lord knows better what He is doing."</em> (<em>Mother laughs</em>) I immediately started smiling (I didn't laugh, but started smiling), and there came the same peace as in the morning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1938">That's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1939"><em>The Lord knows better what He is doing ...</em> with his most perfect sense of humour. And everything calmed down right away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1940">I felt like laughing, but I smiled.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1942"><em>No, I was inside and looking through the window, because the street was full of people.... But Sweet Mother, how is it that I always perceive the same thing?

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1943">But the minute (really the minute ‚Äî it wasn't even a state in time, it really was the minute), the minute I made contact with what I call the Supreme, that is, the part that looks after the earth, throughout the years it has always been i-den-ti-cal-ly the same thing.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1949">This morning, for two hours, I had what I believe to be really the most wonderful experience in my life from the point of view of knowledge-vision. And it was so total ... from the most essential perception of That which is beyond the creation down to the perception of the body's cells, from high to low like that. And in every plane, the vision of the creation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1950">It went on for two hours. I walked about, had my wash ‚Äî it didn't matter in the least, on the contrary there was, added to that, the knowledge of how the body can act without disturbing the state of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1951">Afterwards, there was a slight flagging, because there came ... I can't say the memory (it wasn't a memory), but all the complaints: the same thing as at the balcony on the darshan day ‚Äî the human attitude towards the Supreme is only to complain and demand ... complain and demand and complain ... That's all. It came back. Before, the whole vision was there like that (<em>gesture from high to low</em>), it was magnificent, magnificent: each and every thing, the entire human history, the entire history of intellectual and material evolution, everything, everything like that, everything in its place. It was really fine. And afterwards, there came that wave of complaints.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1952">It was as if the body were asking, "What attitude" (that's what provided the link), "What attitude should I have? What should I do?..." Because there was the vision of life, death, of all occurences, everything was there. The full knowledge of everything. Oh, all the stories of death were very, very interesting, and how mankind has tried to understand, and how there have been all kinds of solutions (that is, partial attitudes), and all of it, all of it was part of the Whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1953">Then the conclusion ... Oh, at that moment I could have said many things about all the different intellectual and even spiritual attitudes</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 259</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1954"> of mankind.... There aren't big differences. The spiritual (what's commonly called "spiritual") boils down to the whole attempt at finding the Divine again by annulling the creation ‚Äî that's what has been regarded as spiritual life (that's why the word got distorted). To annul the creation in order to find the Divine again.... And then, NOW: the vision of now. We are obviously drawing nearer to the moment of possibility ‚Äî that is clear. It's a question of time ‚Äî of course, it can't be on the human scale, but we are on the borderline.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1955">And as I said, the body asked ... oh, it had such a wonderful moment! A moment, a few minutes, so wonderful, when it KNEW how it ought to be. It was magnificent. Then the experience came.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="111" href="#">1</a> Till then, it was inexpressible: it was lived, it was a living consciousness, but the mind had become very quiet, so it was inexpressible. Then there came back that great complaint from the world, and the experience started being expressed (<em>Mother looks for a note</em>). It started being expressed, because it isn't just the anonymous demand of thousands of people: it's virtually a shower of letters, questions, demands from people who believe... who believe they are part of the Work, of the Action, who believe they have given themselves, and all their questions ‚Äî and such futile questions ‚Äî which to them are of crucial importance, but which are so puerile, stupid, unimportant: how to start a business, the opening date, a name for a house, a message for a meeting.... And what goings-on, it's a deluge from every side. So it all was seen in the new attitude ‚Äî not "new," the consciousness was fully there, there had been a whole tendency to increasingly adopt that attitude, but now it was KNOWN, fully known: what one must be, how one must be. So I came down abruptly to reply to all that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1956">For some time there had been lots of questions from people ‚Äî I refused, quite simply refused to answer; I would reply with some jest or other: "I am not a fortune-teller," or "It's none of my concern, none of my business." Jests, and sometimes I would say, "Ah, let them leave me alone, that's childishness." And people who think they are very dedicated, for instance a man who has already given at least ten lakhs of rupees (he knows it only too well, but still he did give them!) and who wants to work to bring more ‚Äî but then, his questions ... So instead of replying with a quip (that was my last experience: it's like dictated answers, but they are quips), this morning something came in English (<em>Mother reads her note</em>):</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1964">You understand, behind this whole earth evolution, there is, more or less consciously (it's an unexpressed need rather than a precise consciousness), the need to live the Divine ‚Äî or to put it differently, the need to live divinely. And it is clear that what was expressed as different religions were solutions found individually ("found," and perhaps partially lived); and here [in India], there was this solution: in order to really become the Divine again, there should be no more creation. That was the Nirvanic solution. And instinctively ‚Äî instinctively ‚Äî mankind felt death to be the negation of the Divine. But like all negation, it had the capacity to lead and open the way. The solution of Christianity wasn't completely new, it was the adaptation of an</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 261</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1965"> ancient solution: a life in other worlds ‚Äî which was expressed by that quite childish conception of paradise. But that was a conception for public use: a life in the presence of the Divine, exclusively taken up with the Divine, and so one sang and ... Touchingly simple. Anyway, they conceived of a world (not a material one) in which a divine life had been realized. In the ancient Indian traditions, there had also been a first hint of already divine worlds, as a sort of reaction to that Nirvanism ‚Äî if we want to be divine, we must stop being, or if the Divine wants to be pure, he must stop manifesting!... So they were all somewhat clumsy attempts to find the means, and perhaps at the same time inner preparations, to make people capable of really making contact with the Divine. Then there was that great reaction of the cult of Matter, which has been VERY useful to knead it and make it less unconscious of itself: it has forcibly brought consciousness back into Matter. So perhaps all that has sufficiently prepared the moment of the coming of Total Manifestation (<em>gesture of descent</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1966">This morning, during the experience, the body felt the whole bliss of the condition, but it was very conscious of its incapacity to manifest and very conscious in such a perfect peace, like this (<em>gesture with the palms of the hands open upward</em>), in which there wasn't even the intensity of the need. It was simply a vision of how things were, how the condition was. And it was something like this: the conditions of the earth are such, the conditions of the substance are such that a local and momentary manifestation, as an example, is not impossible, but the transformation that would make possible the new Manifestation of the supramental being ‚Äî and not just as an isolated case, but with its place and role in earth life ‚Äî does not appear to be immediate. That was the impression.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1967">And there was no anguish to know or anything of the sort, there was simply a very tranquil vision of things, absolutely devoid of almost any need: it was like this (<em>same gesture with palms open</em>), as peaceful as can be, smiling, tranquil, with a sense of eternity.... All that in this body, which was totally, entirely conscious of its incapacity. Naturally, the body, for its part, very clearly feels it neither knows nor is able to know or will or do: simply like this (<em>gesture with palms open</em>), as peacefully open, receptive, surrendered as possible. And that was the result (<em>the vision that the Manifestation was not for the immediate future</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1968">And it always ends in the same way: "What You will."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1969">But with a very clear vision that a collective transformation sufficient to create a new species on earth still seems some way off ... without any estimate of the length of time, but not immediate.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1979">It is from the universal and spiritual point of view that, not exactly "good" as people understand it, but the True, the Truth, will have the final word, that is well known. In other words, the Divine will eventually be victorious. That is what has been said, what all those who have lived a spiritual life have said ‚Äî and it is an absolute fact. When people transpose it, they say, "I am a good boy, I live according to what I think to be true, consequently life should be a bed of roses for me!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) To begin with, self-appreciation is always dubious, and then, in the world as it now is, everything is mixed and what openly manifests to the half-blind human consciousnesses is not the Law of pure Truth ‚Äî they wouldn't even understand it. To put it more precisely, what is constantly realized is the supreme vision, but its realization in this mixed material world isn't seen by the ignorant human vision as the triumph of good (of what men call "good" and "true"). But ‚Äî to put it humorously ‚Äî it's not the Lord's fault, it's mens' fault! That is, the Lord knows what he is doing, but men don't understand it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1980"><em>In a true world, everything would perhaps be the same as now, but it would be seen differently.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1981">Both. There would be a difference. The ignorance and obscurity present in the world are what gives divine Action a distorted appearance; and naturally, that must tend to disappear. But it is also true that there is a way of looking at things which ... you could say, which gives their appearance another meaning ‚Äî the two are there, like this (<em>intertwined gesture</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1982" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1983">It always comes down to this: men's judgment is false ‚Äî false because their vision of things is false, incomplete ‚Äî and their judgment necessarily has false results too.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1984">The world is in perpetual change ‚Äî perpetual, it doesn't remain the same for one second ‚Äî and the general harmony expresses itself more and more perfectly; consequently nothing can remain as it is, and in spite of all contrary appearances, the WHOLE is always in constant</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 264</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1985"> progression: the harmony becomes increasingly harmonious, the truth becomes increasingly true in the Manifestation. But in order to see that, one must see the whole, and man only sees ... not even just the human field, but his own tiny, so tiny, microscopic field ‚Äî he can't understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1986">It is a double thing that complements one another (<em>same intertwined gesture</em>), and with a reciprocal action: as the Manifestation becomes more conscious of itself, its expression becomes more perfect, and also truer. The two movements go together.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1987" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1988">That's one of the things that was seen very clearly the other day, when there was that Knowledge-Consciousness: when the Manifestation has sufficiently emerged from the Inconscient so that the whole necessity of struggle created by the presence of the Inconscient becomes progressively and increasingly pointless, it will disappear quite naturally, and progress, instead of taking place in effort and struggle will begin to take place harmoniously. That's what the human consciousness envisions as a divine creation on earth ‚Äî it will still be only a stage. But to the present stage, it's a sort of harmonious culmination that will change universal progress (which is constant) from a progress in struggle and suffering into a progress in joy and harmony.... But what was seen was that this sense of inadequacy, of something incomplete and imperfect, can be expected to exist for a very long time (if the notion of time remains the same ‚Äî I don't know about that?). But any change implies time, doesn't it? We can't express it in terms of time as we know it, but it implies a succession.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1989">All those so-called problems (I constantly receive questions and more questions and problems of the mind ‚Äî all the problems of Ignorance) are problems of earth-worms. As soon as you emerge above, that type of problem no longer exists. There are no contradictions either. Contradictions always arise from the inadequacy of vision and the incapacity to see something from all standpoints at once.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-1990">In any case, to come back to the down-to-earth question in his notebook, I don't think any sage in any age said, "Be good and all will outwardly go well for you" ‚Äî because that's nonsense. In a world of disorder and a world of falsehood, to hope for that isn't reasonable. But if you are sincere enough and total enough in your way of being, you can have the inner joy and the full satisfaction, whatever the circumstances ‚Äî and nobody, nothing has the power to touch that.

She belonged to a Catholic family of archbishops, even cardinals, anyway it was... And she was extremely interested and wholly convinced: she felt a liberation of the spirit and aspiration. Then, after I had Sri Aurobindo's teaching, I passed it on to her, and there she was really quite taken. But she often told me, "As long as I am awake, everything is fine, but in my sleep I'll suddenly wake up in a dreadful panic: and if the Catholic teaching is true, then I'll go to hell!"

To break free of it, one must be a vital hero. A true hero, you understand. Because it's very strong. I saw that all religions have in that way kinds of congregations in the invisible; but the Christian one is the strongest of them all from a terrestrial standpoint.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="august-30-1967">August 30, 1967</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2034">The last few nights, I have spent almost the whole night, several hours of it, in a place which must certainly belong to the subtle physical and where material life is being reorganized. It's immense ‚Äî immense ‚Äî and the crowd innumerable; but they are individualities, not a crowd, which means that I deal with each one of them. And there are also types of documents and writing tables, but there are no walls! It's a strange place. A very strange place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2035">I have often wondered if the memory of physical forms is what makes me see that world in that way, or IF IT IS really like that. Sometimes there is no doubt because it has its own specific character, but at other times I have a doubt and wonder if it's not in the active memory. Because at that moment I am very conscious, everything is extremely natural, you understand; and it's permanent: I find the same things in the same places again, sometimes with slight differences, but differences made necessary by action. That is to say, it's a coherent world, not wild imaginings. But to what extent are those forms the reflection of material forms? To what extent ARE they really like that, or do we SEE them that way? I am not very sure yet. I had the same problem in the past when I used to go into the Overmind and see the Gods: I always had a kind of hesitation as to whether they really are like that, or whether we perceive them like that because of our physical habits.... There, after a time I reached a conclusion, but here, physically? ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2036">Strangely, there are no doors, no windows, no ceiling or floor, all that is self-existent and does not appear to be subject to the law of gravity, that is, there isn't the earth's magnetic attraction, yet what you write with (<em>laughing</em>) looks like a fountain pen! What you write</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 269</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2037"> on looks like paper; the documents are placed in what look like filing cabinets.... You do feel that the substance isn't the same, but the appearance is very close. And I am still wondering about that appearance: is it because of our ordinary cerebral function that we put the appearance upon things, or is it really like that?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2038">I meet almost everyone there. I told you that you are there quite regularly, and we work. As for you, you don't remember. There are others who remember, but their memory is ... (<em>Mother twists her finger slightly</em>) just slightly off, that is, not identically what I saw. And when they tell me, my impression is, yes, it's because of the transcription in their brain.... The objective reality of the material world stems from the fact that if you see the same object ten times over, ten times it looks like itself, with differences that are logical, or that may be, for instance, differences of wear and tear ‚Äî but there too it's like that! If you study carefully, even in the physical world no two people see things in exactly the same way. There, it may be more pronounced, but it seems to be a similar phenomenon....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2039">The explanation becomes very simple and very easy when you enter the consciousness in which it's the material reality that becomes an illusion ‚Äî it's illusory, inexact: the inner reality is truer. Then, in that case, it's simple. Maybe it's only our mind that is astonished?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2040">Take writing, for instance: I haven't noticed in detail, but when you write over there, you seem to write much more easily.... I don't know how to explain it ... it takes much less time. And things are noted down on paper, but is it paper? It looks like paper, but things are noted down much more directly.... It's perhaps the similarity, like when, for example, you use a fountain pen or a pencil: it's not exactly a fountain pen or a pencil, it's something that looks like it and is ... (what should I say?) the prototype or principle of that object. But what I mean is that if we were still at the time of the quill or the twig that you dip into ink, I would probably see it like that!... It's the ESSENCE or principle of the thing, which in the memory, is translated as a similarity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2041">But it's an action. I am aware of the time only when I return, because I have made it a habit to look at the time when I come back to the material consciousness (there is a watch beside my bed and I look at it), and that's how I can say, "It lasted an hour" or "It lasted two hours." But there, you don't have the sense of time at all, it's not the same sense at all ‚Äî what matters is the CONTENT of the action, and during those hours, many, many things are done, so many. I meet you very regularly, but many others too, and I am at many places at the same time! And when someone tells me, "Oh, I saw you last night,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 270</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2042"> you did this and that," then somewhere up above I say, "Oh, it's true indeed." There's a tiny (<em>same gesture of twist</em>), tiny little difference, but the essence of the thing is the same.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2043">And I have noticed that with those things that are very close to the physical, if you wake up abruptly, and especially if you move upon waking, or if you stir or turn over, they go away. It's only if later I have a very quiet moment and go within myself that I can slowly make contact again with that state. Therefore I am not surprised that most people don't remember. Experiences in the vital, in the mind, are much more easily remembered, but that, that which is very close to the physical ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2044">And its character is such that if you kept the consciousness of it when you woke up, you'd look a little mad. I had that experience two days ago, and it taught me a lot ‚Äî I looked, studied and studied until I had understood. It was during the afternoon rest (I don't sleep at all in the afternoon, but just enter the inner consciousness), and I had decided beforehand that I would "wake up," that is, get up, at such and such a time. When the time came, I was still very much in my action and it went on, the state of consciousness went on with open eyes; and in that state of consciousness there was ... (I can't say "I" because it's not the same "I," you understand; at such times I am many people), but the "I" of that moment was in the habit (not here materially but "up there") of wearing a gold watch (<em>gesture to the wrist</em>) and had forgotten to put that watch on; and looked and noticed it: "Ah, I forgot to put my watch on, what's happened to it? Why did I forget?" Like that. So then, when I woke up (I don't wear any watch here, as you know), when I came back, the two consciousnesses were simultaneous, and I said aloud, "Where is my watch? I forgot to put my watch on." And it's only when I had said that (<em>laughing</em>) that I realized! So it left me thinking, I studied carefully, looked carefully, and clearly saw that at that moment the two consciousnesses were absolutely (<em>Mother closely superposes her two hands</em>), but absolutely simultaneous.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2045">It's very interesting. Oh, all kinds of problems have been solved with that experience. For instance, the problem of many people who are called mad, and who are simply in that subtle consciousness (<em>same superposed gesture</em>): at certain times it prevails, which makes them say things that are meaningless here but have a very clear meaning over there, and so the consciousness is like this (<em>superposed gesture, almost merged</em>). That explains many cases of so-called madness. Certain cases of apparent insincerity are also like that, because the consciousness sees clearly in that region, and that region is so</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 271</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2046"> close that you can give things the same names (they seem to have the same shapes or very similar ones), but it's not what is conventionally called here "tangible reality": materially, outwardly, things aren't exactly like that. And so, there are cases of so-called insincerity that are simply too close a mingling of the two consciousnesses ‚Äî too close for an active discernment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2047">Oh, a whole region has been clarified, and not only clarified but with the key to the cure or the transformation. From the psychological, internal point of view, it has explained a great deal of things ‚Äî a great deal. It brings down considerably the number of cases of real mental derangement and cases of real lies, that is, the cases when one deliberately and consciously says the contrary of what is ‚Äî that must not be as frequent as we think. Many people say incorrect things like that (<em>floating gesture</em>), but they have perceptions in another world than the purely material world, with too close a mingling and without sufficient discernment to be aware of the mingling.... Sri Aurobindo used to say that real bad will, real hostility and real falsehood are fairly rare cases ("real" in the sense of absolute in themselves, and conscious, deliberate ‚Äî deliberate, absolute, conscious); that's rare. And that, he said, is what is described as hostile beings. But all the rest is a sort of illusion of the consciousness, consciousnesses that interfere with one another (<em>Mother intertwines the fingers of her two hands in a to and fro movement</em>), but without a precise discernment between the different consciousnesses, which are like this (<em>same gesture</em>), intermingled, each going in and out of the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2048" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2049">So the result has been to see the immensity of the problem to be solved, of the path to be followed, and of the transformation to be worked out.... When you look at it from the purely psychological standpoint, it's relatively easy and swift, but when you come down to this (<em>Mother touches her body</em>), to the outer form and so-called matter, oh, it's a whole world! Each lesson ... it's as if you were given lessons, and it's so interesting! Lessons with all the consequences and explanations. You spend one day or two days like that over a tiny little discovery. And you see that after that, after that day or those hours of work, there is a change in the body consciousness: the light is there, it's changed ‚Äî changed, the reactions are not the same. But ... (<em>Mother gestures to express a world of toil</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2050">And the Presence ‚Äî the Presence becomes more and more intimate, more and more concrete, and at such times ... at times (<em>Mother makes a gesture like a swelling</em>) it's so concrete as to be as if absolute.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 272</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2051"> Then (<em>gesture of being covered again</em>) another state of consciousness comes and everything has to begin all over again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2052">Interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2053">And it's so clearly to teach you ... High-sounding words, great attitudes, remarkable experiences are all very fine up above, but here ... nothing spectacular ‚Äî everything is very modest, very quiet, very unassuming. Very modest. And that's the condition for progress, the condition for the transformation.</p>

And the same day, the very same day, I got a letter from an Indian, a man of about forty-years-old, who wrote to me, "<em>When I was sitting in front of you, you looked at me for a long time and I felt that your eyes were burning all impurities in me.</em>" So naturally, he expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 287</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2169">You know, when I go there (<em>to the music room</em>) to see people, I simply concentrate and there is a sort of invocation to the Lord's Presence. And when He is there, when I feel the whole room full of Him, then it's good. That is the sole will (<em>immobile, passive gesture turned upward</em>). I expressed this when I said to someone, "I give them a bath of the Lord"! And that's indeed how it is: His Presence, His Action ... His Presence, His Action ... That's all. And when I look at them, there is no more person: there is only His Presence and His Action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2170">So there we are, it has a different effect on each one!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2171">They tell me, "Your look purifies me".... I don't want to go into such considerations and do not answer anything, but there is only the Presence and the Action. I don't even try to know, neither what happens nor how nor what He does nor what takes place ‚Äî nothing. The only thing that comes into me (into this consciousness) is the state of the person who is there: that's very clearly recorded. (<em>Laughing</em>) The other day, there was a very amusing experience.... A girl here has taken a fancy to a gentleman ‚Äî neither of them is very young, that is, they are neither children nor young people: they are both over thirty, or between twenty-five and thirty. So she writes him letters, long letters, sends him sweets, sends him flowers, and he passes it all on to me. (There is nothing more than that.) It was her birthday, and she must have had a rather guilty conscience, I suppose ‚Äî as for me, I had completely forgotten the story.... She came for her birthday, I received her as I always do, in the same way ‚Äî and suddenly, gnawing pains, cramps, sharp pains in the stomach. I wondered, "What's going on in her? What is all this?" And it went on for quite a while, I had to make a little concentration to make it go. Then in the afternoon, the gentleman (I don't think they meet) sends me a letter and a box of sweets she had sent him. Ah! (<em>Laughing</em>) I said, "So there! She was afraid I would scold her and had gnawing pains in the stomach!" There you are.... That's how it is, you understand, it's a kind of work in a general unification. And people's reactions are felt in my body, that's how I become aware of it, conscious of it.... (<em>Laughing</em>) At times it's bliss, at other times stomach cramps!</p>

<p class="Ps">(<em>Regarding a rather painful letter Satprem has received from that same very Catholic lady.</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2173">Yes, the first impression was ... painful, then I took a good look; and at bottom, the whole trouble comes from the fact that this person has a very high opinion of herself, she judges everything from the height of her superiority ‚Äî for instance, that air of benevolent compassion for the Ashram.... But that was my first impression when I saw her for the first time, and it has been growing since then and this letter has fully confirmed it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2174">So then, I didn't say anything, but yesterday I made F. talk about the lady, and she finally told me, "There is something I have never told you because it made me uneasy, but today I will tell you. Soon after we first met, Mrs. Z told me one day (I repeat word for word), 'Because of MY position and YOUR position, I am convinced that we are destined to bring about the rapprochement of the Catholic Church and the Ashram....'" F. told me, "I didn't reply ‚Äî didn't argue, didn't answer, didn't say a word or anything, I just left it at that."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2175">But I said to myself, "There is the answer to everything ..." She has put herself at the very top, on the "summit" of the Catholic religion....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2176"><em>Yes, she told me the same thing.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2177">That's it: she has been sent by God (<em>laughing</em>) to bring about the rapprochement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2178">So, it is wiser not to say anything, to leave it at that ‚Äî not to argue or reply. If she comes (I don't think she will dare) just be polite, that's all. To reply is to play her game (that's what she wants). If you like, I will keep your letter and hers with me like that, because for me it makes a centre of action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2179">Before she came to see me, I didn't know she was a fervent Catholic, I hadn't thought about it, but the first time she came to see me, I simply thought (I saw), "My dear girl, you lack the humility indispensable for making progress." That's all. Then everything has been unveiled little by little, and yesterday the picture was complete because it takes some cheek to say, "We are destined to bring about the rapprochement of the Catholic Church and the Ashram."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2182">All this is part of a great Plan of organization in the Mind....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="117" href="#">1</a></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2183">You know, in olden days you were put through ordeals ‚Äî they were symbolic things, naturally, but you were aware that they were ordeals, so you were on your guard. But now ... I remember, in the very beginning, when I started working with Sri Aurobindo, he warned me (I had already noticed it long before) that the circumstances of life are at each minute organized in such a way that the one who is destined to do the work is confronted with his own difficulties, which he must conquer, and with the difficulties of the world he works in, which he must conquer too. If he has the necessary humility to see in himself what must be transformed so he can become capable of doing the Work, then all goes well. Naturally, if he is full of pride and vanity and believes the whole fault lies outside and there is none in him, then naturally things go wrong. And the difficulties become more pronounced. And for as long as I did the work, for ... (how many years?) the thirty years I worked with Sri Aurobindo and he was there, I was like this (<em>gesture hidden behind Sri Aurobindo</em>), so comfortable, you know ‚Äî I was in front, I seemed to be the one doing the work ‚Äî but for my part, I felt completely protected, behind him like this (<em>same gesture</em>); I was very tranquil, not trying to understand or know or anything ‚Äî I was simply attentive to ... what had to be done, what had to be done. It was rarely necessary to tell him; sometimes I was faced with a difficulty then I would tell him, but he didn't need to answer: it was immediately understood ‚Äî thirty years like that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2184">And when he left, there was a whole part ‚Äî the most material part of the descent of the supramental body down to the mind ‚Äî that visibly came out of his body like that and entered mine, and it was so concrete that I felt the FRICTION of forces passing through the pores of the skin.... I remember having said at the time, "Well, anyone who has had this experience can, by this experience, bring the proof of afterlife to the world." It was ... it was as concrete as if it had been material. So naturally, after that it was there in the field of consciousness.... But I have seen more and more, more and more, that all that happens, all the people we meet, all that happens to us personally (that is, taking this little body as being the person), all of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 290</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2185"> that is ALWAYS a test: you stand firm or you don't; if you stand firm, you make a progress forward; if you don't, you have to go through it again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2186">Now it has become that way FOR THE BODY: when it hurts, when it gets disorganized, when it threatens to fall apart.... And then, there is always that Consciousness inside, straight as a sword, that says, "Now, will you stand firm?" And the cells are really touchingly good willed: "Oh, is it like that? Well, very well." So you remain very quiet, very peaceful, and then you call ‚Äî you call the Lord. And you repeat the mantra, which comes automatically, and ... Peace establishes itself. And after a while the pain has disappeared ‚Äî everything, just everything, all the threats disappear one after the other That's how it is: "Lord, You are there ..." And you know, such dazzling, indisputable proof of this Presence, which is so wonderful and so simple, so simple, so total, in all that comes, all that happens, down to the smallest detail, so as to lead you as fast as possible to the transformation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2187">And all that comes near ‚Äî comes near at a greater or lesser distance, but that comes near, is borne along in the Movement, without even knowing it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2188">That's why I have kept this lady's letter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2189">To come back to her Catholic preoccupation, there have been some really interesting things.... You know that the Pope, when he came here to Bombay, said things that I had told him like this (<em>gesture of inner communication</em>) when we had that conversation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="118" href="#">2</a> (he certainly does not know with whom he had that conversation, but I think he is conscious enough to know he had one). A conversation ... We had three conversations like that, but one was long, important, precise; he himself was taken, like that, and when the time came to leave each other ‚Äî for him to go back to his body and for me to go back to my work ‚Äî he said to me, "And what will you say to people about our meeting?..." I told you the story. And, well, the things he said when he came here to India were exactly what I had told him; the resolutions he passed there were exactly what I had told him ... which proves it has had some effect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2190">Have you heard about the latest decision?... In the church, the priest always used to turn his back to the faithful while officiating: he would face the deity and turn his back to the faithful (the original idea was certainly that he represented the faithful's aspiration and prayer: he addressed himself to the Divine). Now the Pope has said,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 291</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2191"> "Turn your altars around, face the public and represent the Divine." It's interesting.... They are doing it here now, and the comical part is that they've asked U. to do the work of turning the altars around. That's how I know it, it's U. who told me; they have asked him to go to all the churches here and turn the altars around. It's a big job because they are embedded.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2192" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2193"><em>I'd like to be clear on one point deep down in my consciousness. If this person comes to see me again, should I keep alive in her the idea of the possibility of reconciliation between her Christ and the Yoga, or leave her under no illusion and tell her, "Anyone who wants to do the Yoga must break out of that"?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2194">When I read her letter and learned the whole story, as always I did like this (<em>gesture of immobile offering upward</em>), and then the TRUE thing came (not at all what she thinks or what the Pope thinks, but the TRUE thing): an essential unity that will manifest on earth, but not just for this particular religion ‚Äî for ALL religions, all the religions that were manifestations of a ... (let us say, to understand each other clearly), an Avatar, that is, something that was sent down from above, that came to earth to bring a message, and a religion came out of it (I am not talking about all the forms of superstition and ignorance). Those religions are destined to go back to their Origin and form a complex unity, complete, total, that is to say, the essence of all human aspirations for ... the unknown Divine. And that has not only been sanctioned: it EXISTS. In other words, it's ready to descend.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2195">In egoistic and limited human consciousnesses, it finds expression in this or that person, or it finds expression in the Pope who, naturally, would like to....<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="119" href="#">3</a> That's his whole raison d'√™tre, otherwise he would just be one little man among many others. In other words, there is the whole motivation of human egoism that is there. That's what distorts everything. But there is a "something" (which they talk about without knowing what they talk about), a something ready to manifest. And at the same time I seem to be told, "Don't worry, be in peace, you don't need to do anything: it WILL BE, and as usual you will spontaneously say what you need to say, without knowing it." There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2196">But what I wanted to say is that if she comes materially, you shouldn't try to fight or convince her or change her, you should ...</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 292</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2197"> be a manifestation: you know, the shining Light, WITHOUT INTENTION. Then the work will be done in order. To be the shining Light ‚Äî without intention. Simply the shining Light. Then you quite spontaneously say what you have to say, but without intention, without mental intention. You do what you have to do, say what you have to say ‚Äî the Lord is there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2198">It's interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2199">These people (<em>laughing</em>), we could say that their ego has taken the attitude of being the Divine's instrument ‚Äî but it's the ego. So naturally, they don't see clearly: they see what they want to see, do what they want to do. And for them, "I am God's instrument."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2200">We'll see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2201">I am trying to keep her somewhat quiet, I don't like her to interfere too much in your life. It's an unnecessary strain. But if you do as I've said, if you withdraw into the Light and remain like that, it will no longer tire you, or much less at any rate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2202" style="text-align: right;">(<em>long silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2203">It's this extraordinary experience that when you take all that comes as the means to learn to be what you should be ‚Äî to increase your receptivity, increase your effectiveness ‚Äî you immediately feel a wonderful, all-powerful Presence, but concrete, "like that."</p>

And for that brochure they have solicited(!) the opinion of all prominent people: there is Indira Gandhi, the President of India, and what have you. And everyone says what has always been said millions of times over: "A great personality, this and that...." All the usual nonsense. So I wrote this:</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2210"><em>Soon afterwards</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2211">I had many things to say, but now I don't remember.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2212">Only an observation, which is really very interesting: it's that everyone has said the same thing, all those who have had the Experience have said the same thing ... but each one in his own way, so it looks like something different. Yesterday it was so clear, and again the whole morning, from early morning: this way, that way, this one here, that one there (<em>Mother shows different facets</em>), the philosophers, founders of religions, sages of all countries ‚Äî they have always said the same thing. For instance, the Buddha's teaching and, say, the Christian teaching, seem to be so different, but it's always the same thing. That is to say, there is ONE state (if you catch hold of it), ONE state in which you are conscious of the divine Consciousness (not "conscious of": "conscious through" or "conscious with," I don't know how to explain ... it's the divine Consciousness which is conscious, that is, the Consciousness in its essence), and there are no more problems there, no more complications, no more explanations, nothing anymore ‚Äî everything is as clear as can be. So then, each one has tried to explain that, and naturally it has become confused, incomplete, incorrect, with one explanation clashing with another ‚Äî while everyone is talking about the same thing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2213">It came yesterday in relation to a boy who sent me the letter from one of his friends, in which he said the usual nonsense: "I don't believe in God because I can't see him." The usual little stupidity. And in that connection, I saw (I looked, like that, looked for a long time), I saw that the one who rejects, the one who asserts, the one ... all that, all of it is (how could I put it?) variations on the same theme, even when it appears to be saying the contrary.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 294</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2214">Yesterday it was interesting, because the observation was the same for the materialists who feel that the only truth is a "concrete" truth, the truth that can, according to them, be seen or heard or touched.... And it's the same thing, the same state ‚Äî the same state reflected in different between mirrors. But the difference in mirrors is not an essential and radical difference, it's only ... (<em>gesture showing facets in movement</em>), yes, that's what some have called the "play," but it's not even a play; I could almost say it's a difference of position.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2215">Everything you can say about it is nothing, it's part of that enormous jibbering that tries to express the inexpressible "something." But when you are IN it, it's so clear, so obvious ‚Äî simple, without problems. And the world is no longer a problem.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2216">Even that apparently rather fundamental difference between those who regard the Manifestation as divine and essential and those who consider that in order to reach the essential Divine you must leave the Manifestation (because it's an "error" ‚Äî that is, an error that took place in the Consciousness), even those two positions are the same thing! But how can you explain it? When you say that, it seems foolish, yet up above it's true. It's true ‚Äî true and full. It's full, not hollow ‚Äî here everything rings hollow, so hollow; the hollowness of inadequacy. But up above...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2217">It's almost like a kaleidoscope: you turn it and get one picture, turn it again and get another picture, turn it again ... yet it's always the same thing!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2218">But now, it's the body that has the Experience. In a certain state, the state which corresponds to That, the essential state, everything is harmonious, with a living, smiling, happy peace; then as soon as there is ... a nothing, you know, a mere trifle, simply the coming into the atmosphere of something conflicting ‚Äî a mere nothing ‚Äî it's felt like something extremely acute and painful. But not in the way of the pain of Ignorance, it's more like ... you could call it an uneasiness, but it's not even that.... Everyone has explained it in his own way: some have called it "falling from the Truth into Falsehood," others "falling from the Light into Darkness," others "falling from Ananda into suffering," yet others ... Everyone has given his explanation, but it's something else.... As for me, I have no words for it, but the body feels it, feels it very acutely, and it sees that at the end of it, the consequence of it, is disintegration. And its whole effort is to strive to reestablish that inner harmony, that harmonic state in which everything becomes harmonious, everything ‚Äî and in their appearance things haven't changed! Yet in one way they are marvellous, and in the other detestable.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 295</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2219">The opposition between the two things is becoming more pronounced every minute: one moment everything is divine, the next moment everything is detestable ‚Äî yet it's the same thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2220">Since the 15th of August, since that experience at the balcony,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="120" href="#">1</a> it has become very clear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2221">But then, it has nothing to do with thought, or even with sensation: it's purely material (<em>Mother touches the skin of her hands</em>), and it's the difference between a progressive and unbroken harmony that has no reason to stop, which becomes more and more conscious, more and more harmonious, and also more and more ... we say blissful, happy and all that ‚Äî but it's not that! It's "something" ... something SO NATURAL, so natural and... with the rhythm of eternity. So it is THAT, and then suddenly (<em>gesture of reversal</em>) you fall back into ... exactly the SAME THING, everything is the same, yet everything is the opposite!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2222">To such an extent that you have a perception, a material perception, inexpressible because it's hardly mentalized, of a perfect Harmony which can, in the consciousness, turn into a serious illness! Things of that sort.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2223">There is the vision, an extremely complex and at the same time complete vision, that those, for instance, who have tried to explain the power of imagination, of thought or will or faith (all those things: the direct action on matter), the vision that each of those things has caught hold of one little aspect of the Thing, but in the Thing, there are no divisions; it's something which, when you perceive or conceive it, is divided into scores of little things, but it's essentially ... (how should I put it?) a way of being, a state of consciousness ‚Äî it's a WAY OF BEING, not even a "state of consciousness" because that implies "being conscious OF something" and it's not that: it's a way of being. And that way of being is what, in the human consciousness, expresses itself as "Ah, the Divine!" ‚Äî by opposition, you understand. It's a PERFECTLY NATURAL and spontaneous way of being ‚Äî but how, how does That become this? How does That become distorted?... You constantly, constantly (<em>gesture as of tiny reversals</em>) switch from one to the other, back and forth, over and over again, as if to learn ‚Äî to learn how That becomes this (the mechanism of the passage). To us it looks like (to us, to all this poor consciousness that has gone through innumerable woeful experiences), it looks like a "relapse" into the old state; therefore it's not that. But what's the mechanism?...</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2250"><em>The Pope's conversion! No!</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2251">I was very happy because it proved to me that our conversations hadn't been in vain.

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2252">Vatican City, September 26</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2253">The Pope, in an article published here last night, has said his journey to India in 1964 was "the revelation of an unknown world."<br/>
The <em>Osservatore Romano</em> published in an article excerpts from a forthcoming book of conversations with the Pope by a lifelong friend, the French philosopher and academician, Jean Guitton.<br/>
"I saw, as is said in the Apocalypse, a limitless crowd, a multitude, an enormous welcome. In those thousands of faces I read, stronger than curiosity, a kind of indescribable sympathy," the Pope said.<br/>
"India is a spiritual country. It has in its nature a sense of the 'Christian virtues'....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2254">"Christians," he sees everything through his Christian word, but never mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2255">"If there is any country in which the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount could ever become a reality for the mass of the country, that country is India," Pope Paul added....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2256">Can you imagine!</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2257">"What is nearer to the souls of Indians than poverty of spirit, sweetness, peace, mercy, and pureness of heart?" he asked.<br/>
"While the leaders of the West are politicians, in the land of India they are mystics and sages....</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2258">Yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2259">"Life runs in contemplation. People speak in a low voice. Their movements are slow and liturgical. The country is 'born for the spirit'," the Pope said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2260">All the same, it means he is receptive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2261">And it explains the manner in which he received P. when he went there. P. (<em>an Indian disciple</em>), as you know, paid him a visit; he was taken there by an Italian who had come here (a very nice boy who showed him around Italy and took him to the Pope). The Pope gave</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 299</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2262"> him a private audience, and after talking to him, asking questions, replying (it was a whole conversation), he said to P. with a smile, "And now what are you going to give me?" (They spoke in French.) Then P. said, "I have only one thing, which I always keep with me and is infinitely precious to me, but I will give it to you," and he gave him <em>Prayers and Meditations</em>. And the Pope answered, "I am going to read them."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2263">So it all fits together.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2264">It's interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2265">Oh, yesterday I saw the photo of a man, a German who speaks German, but it's not clear whether he was born in Germany or in America. He must be around forty or forty-five, and for many years ... The story goes like this: his parents, both father and mother, were thorough non-believers, and when he was born (or anyway the day after his birth), there was a horizontal column of light on his head, visible to the naked eye. Naturally, the parents were troubled. But the interesting thing is that it's going on. That man (I saw the photos) held a meeting in America of four thousand people (I saw the photo, four thousand people!) and while he was talking there was that column of light, it could be seen in the photograph. It was about as thick as an arm and this long (<em>about twenty centimetres</em>). And he feels he is "spoken to," that something like the supreme Divinity speaks to him, and that he has been told to proclaim the coming of the second Christ!... Well ... He proclaims and gives people a kind of baptism. I saw his photo and ... it's very strange, he has a strong, powerful face, but a nasty mouth (<em>blade-like gesture</em>), tight-lipped, pinched.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2266">And recently I saw two photos of the heads of the Rosicrucian movement in Holland (or Belgium, I forget), the Rosicrucian movement in Europe ‚Äî exactly the same nasty, hard, inexorable mouth. Odd.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2267"><em>Right in the beginning, you told me the same thing about the Pope.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2268">Yes, he has the same expression; but he has a less nasty mouth, though with something inexorable.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2269">But what is it?... And all those people, who are Christians, have it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2270">Anyway, about that German, it's quite obviously a vital phenomenon. To be visible to the naked eye, it can only be a vital light. And he has innumerable disciples. He baptizes them for the second coming of Christ.... It seems (I am not sure because it was written in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 300</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2271"> German and only extracts were translated to me), but he doesn't at all seem to have a philosophical mind or conceptions: it's only a kind of action to bring people into contact with that light. I heard about him from a German woman who is here (her mother is in Germany and she is a disciple of that man and she sent her the book). But her mother is a bit frightened.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2272">There is something inexorable ‚Äî why? I don't understand. Because Christ came, on the contrary, to speak of brotherhood, goodness, charity, compassion.... Yet this expression has something inexorable ‚Äî yes, there is no other word: thin-lipped and the mouth in a straight line like this (<em>same blade-like gesture</em>). It gives the appearance of a terrible nastiness, something inexorable (which found expression in the Inquisition, tortures and so on). Why is it there?... But that German, for instance, the light was there when he was a baby, the day after his birth ‚Äî he didn't have an inexorable mouth at that time!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2273"><em>But the difficulty with all those people ‚Äî the Pope, this German, those Rosicrucians ‚Äî is that basically they only think in terms of a Church....</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2274">Of course!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2275"><em>In terms of a Church and of power over people to keep them shut in their construction.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2276">Yes, exactly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2277"><em>That's the difficulty.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2278">Exactly. That German, for instance (I am not sure because I haven't read the whole thing), gives baptism ‚Äî he baptizes, which means putting one's hand on the person and keeping him under it (<em>gesture over a bowing head</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2279">There is also a Korean, have you seen his photo? ... I saw his photo, he is a hefty fellow and must be the same age, between thirty and forty. A Korean who, for his part, bluntly says that he is, not the reincarnation of Christ (I don't think he is Christian), but the "new Avatar" (if he knew the Indian tradition, he would say "Kalki"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="121" href="#">1</a>). And it seems he has hundreds of thousands of disciples! I saw his photo ... I saw him "Korean," you understand, that is, not universal.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 301</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2280">But it means things are moving everywhere ‚Äî moving more and more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2281">But this, a Pope saying this, is new. It's new.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2282">And I had that mental contact with him perhaps just three weeks before he came to India (of course his thought was turned to India). We had a very interesting conversation, and all I said came to: "Spirituality is much vaster than a Church, and as long as you limit spiritual realization to a Church or a religion, you will be in complete Falsehood." He listened. And when he came to India, that's what he said!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2283">But I told you he was tormented by something. When he left, when it was time for me to get up and take leave of each other, he looked at me with a sort of anxiety in his eyes, and he said to me, "What will you say to your disciples about our meeting?" I smiled and said, "I will tell them that we were united in the love ..." (not "identical" or "common," I forget the words) "for the supreme Lord." Then his face relaxed and he left.... "We were united in the same ..." It wasn't the "same" it was ... I don't know, something expressing that both of us had been united in "the love for the Supreme Lord." And I said it like that, with a smile, which means it was Sri Aurobindo who spoke with his sense of humour.... His face relaxed and he left.</p>
<p class="Ps">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="Ps">(<em>After a long meditation, Mother, still deep within and half in trance, starts speaking:</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2284">Did you feel anything special?... Because the last two or three days, but especially last night and this morning, it was the body learning, the cells have learnt ... I told you that the work till now has been the change ‚Äî the transfer ‚Äî from acting out of habit and reaction to letting the divine Consciousness act. And this morning, for a part of the night and the whole morning until people started coming, with every action, every movement, every gesture, all the tiny little things (when, for instance, a problem is put by someone or a decision has to be taken, since years the answer comes from above), but now with all material movements, also the inner movements, with the attitude of the body, the attitude of the cells, the absolutely material consciousness, with everything, everything ‚Äî the old method was gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2285">It began with the perception of the remaining difference between how things were and how they should be, then that perception disappeared and there only remained "that".... Something (how can</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 302</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2286"> I explain?) ... The English word <em>smooth</em> is the most expressive; everything is done <em>smoothly</em>, everything without exception: bathing, brushing one's teeth, washing one's face, everything (eating, since long has been worked on in order for it to be done in the true way). It always begins with this sort of (<em>Mother opens her hands</em>) <em>surrender</em> (I don't know the right word, it's neither abdication nor offering but between the two; I don't know, there is no French word for it), the surrender of the WAY in which we do things: not of the thing in itself, which is quite unimportant (in that state there is no "big" and "small," no "important" and "unimportant"). And it's something so ... (<em>even gesture</em>) uniform in its multiplicity, there is nothing that clashes or grates or causes difficulties anymore or ... (all those words express things so crudely): it's something that moves forward, on and on in a movement so ... (<em>same even gesture</em>) the nearest word is <em>smooth</em>, that is, without resistance. I don't know. And it's not an intensity of delight, it's not that: that also is so even, so regular (<em>same even gesture</em>), but not uniform: it's innumerable. And EVERYTHING is like that (<em>same gesture</em>), in one same ... rhythm (the word "rhythm" is violent). It's not uniformity, but something so even, and which feels so sweet, you know, and with a TREMENDOUS power in the smallest things.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2287">For several days there was (I told you the other day) the vision of cruelty in human beings, and a very active work to make it disappear from the manifestation. That's part of the general work, with such a concrete power (<em>Mother clenches her fist</em>) for it to disappear. It began with visions of horrors (almost memories), which were seen ‚Äî more than seen, you understand: things that aroused that reprobation, horror.... Then it organizes itself in its totality and the whole thing was taken up like that (<em>Mother opens her arms</em>), all those movements in time (time and space merge into something ... an immensity ‚Äî immensity, infinitude, and, I might say, "multiplicity," but the words are poor), anyway it was a totality taken up in the consciousness ‚Äî a totality of ways of being and vibrations ‚Äî and as if presented to the Supreme Consciousness so it may be transformed, so it may cease to exist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2288">That's how it began.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2289">Then, once that was done, it was as if concretized, concentrated on this little point of a body, so that, there too, certain things, certain vibrations of unconsciousness can no longer exist. And today the outcome was that transfer, which was constant ‚Äî constant, unadulterated for about four hours. Afterwards ... It's mostly the invasion of outside things that cuts off the experience. Yet there is no reproval of that invasion; the transformation ‚Äî the TRANSFER ‚Äî must continue</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 303</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2290"> AMID the contact with all that comes. Then it will be fine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2291">There are two things. There is all this crowd I see constantly, and since long (a "long" time, that is in human terms), as soon as I am there, as soon as the body is there to see the people, it becomes no more than a channel, a kind of ... (<em>gesture showing the Force flowing down through Mother to the people</em>), for the Consciousness of the Lord to flow through it and go. There isn't even, or there is as little need to receive as possible: it's an Action like this (<em>same gesture through Mother</em>), the Force passing through. And when it happens in that room over there which is reserved exclusively for seeing people, the room fills with the Presence, and it's as if that Presence opened its arms to receive people, took them, enveloped them, and then let them go out.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2292">But as regards the things personal to this body, like all that has to do with bathing, food, all that now no longer takes place in the same way. I don't know how to explain ... Here, it's an activity; over there, it's simply like that, a Presence. Here, it's an activity: you have to fill a glass with water, put toothpaste, brush your teeth ‚Äî they are all activities. And, well ... there are no more memories, no more habits; things aren't done because you learned to do them that way: they are done spontaneously by the Consciousness. In the transition between the old and the new movement there is a difficult little moment when the old habit is no longer there, and the new consciousness is not there permanently, so ... For example, it results in apparently clumsy gestures, movements that are not exactly what they should be. But it doesn't last, it happens once in a while for a particular thing, just for the lesson to be learned ‚Äî there is always a lesson waiting to be learned.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2293">To replace memory, the remembrance, the action, with ... For instance, if you want to know where someone lives, his address or house (that was last night's activity), the old method, the mental method has to be replaced with the new method of consciousness that knows the thing just when it has to be done: "This needs to be done." It's not, "Ah, I have to go there," no: you are at each moment where you should be, and when you come to the place you had to go to: "Ah, here it is."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2294">It's really very interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2295">So, between the moment when you act like everyone and the moment when you act ‚Äî when it's the Lord that acts, between the two, there's a little transition: you no longer quite know this, and don't yet quite know that, so this poor body has moments of uncertainty and awkwardness. But it's learning its lesson very fast.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2296">Really interesting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2298">One can well understand why saints and sages, those who wanted to feel themselves live constantly in this divine atmosphere, had got rid of all material things ‚Äî because they weren't transformed, and so they fell back into the old way of being. And there comes a moment when it's ... unpleasant. But if you transform that ... it's in-com-pa-rably, vastly superior, in the sense that it gives an extraordinary STABILITY and consciousness and REALITY. Things become the TRUE vision, the TRUE consciousness; it becomes so concrete, so real!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2299">Nothing ‚Äî nothing else, nothing else can give that fullness.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2302">The most difficult thing left is talking, it's what is the most difficult, it takes a great effort. This morning, while in that experience, there was almost a kind of entreaty from the body: "Oh, don't talk, don't tell him." I didn't intend to talk, but (<em>gesture from above</em>) I am compelled to. The body doesn't intend to talk, it doesn't like to, but something obliges it to.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2303">That's the only difficult thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2304">Words are so inadequate! I have been asked that, too: how will they communicate, the wholly supramental beings (I mean, without the mixture of this material origin), how will they communicate? Simply like this? (<em>gesture of inner exchange</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2305">Talking takes such an effort.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2306">And it's not a "thought communication" like what they call telepathy, it's not that: it's... movements of consciousness. That too, without resistance: movements of consciousness [in Matter]. If, for instance, something needs to be done but not by this body, by another, we are still obliged to say, "This needs to be done in such and such a way," and that represents ... you feel as if you have to lift a mountain, whereas if the other person were in the same state, it would get done quite naturally and spontaneously. I've had examples: now and then I SEE (not "think," but see), I see: "This needs to be like that" (very small things) and I don't say anything ‚Äî the other body does it. It happens now and then, rarely ‚Äî but it ought to be the constant state.... Oh, what an admirable life!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2313">Power to heal?... I saw in <em>Plan√®te</em> the story of a man born in 1905, who for thirty-five years has been healing people by the laying on of hands!<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="122" href="#">1</a> His father was Italian, his mother Spanish, and he was born in France, he is French. For thirty-five years he has been practicing the laying on of hands; he has treated five million people ‚Äî five million. Out of them two-thirds were cured, and he has been taken to court countless times ... by doctors, naturally: he had no right to heal people because he wasn't under oath!... At one of the hearings (I'll tell you the beginning of the story after ‚Äî the beginning at the end!), maybe one of the last hearings, suddenly his lawyer arrived very ill, with an attack of sciatica that prevented him from moving one leg, he was in acute pain. The judge, thinking himself very clever, told him, "Well, why don't you cure your lawyer to begin with?" The man got up, laid his hands on his lawyer, and five minutes later the lawyer was cured: "Oh, but I am cured!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) He was convicted just the same. Wonderful. Anyhow, when he was quite small, that is, five or six, he had stolen a fish from his father who had gone fishing, and the fish couldn't be found. Fifteen days later, his parents found the fish among his things, with his toys ... absolutely dry and perfectly intact! Then the father tried an experiment to see: they had a fishbowl with goldfish; he took out two goldfish and gave one to his son, putting it in the hollow of his son's hand ‚Äî the fish started drying up. As for the second fish, a few hours later it was rotten. Then they mentioned it to doctors (they were living in Toulouse, that was a little later, when he was twelve or thirteen). One doctor had in his hospital a patient whose wound he had been trying to heal for weeks and weeks in vain: it was horrible, purulent. The doctor called the child, who laid on his hands ‚Äî twenty four hours later, the wound was healed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2314">And this man (I saw his photo, he has a magnificent head) says, "I live in God's presence."

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2315"> more people (when that was read out to me, I thought, "And I complain!"). It's admirable. He did some studies, but he isn't a philosopher, he doesn't have any theories: he seems to have been born like that, with healing hands. He probably gets rid of infections by dehydrating them, so he cures all the diseases of that nature. And they did (poor man, they must have made his life impossible!), they did encephalograms, cardiograms and so on, and they noticed that just when he lays his hands (for a few seconds, two or three minutes at the most), at that moment his heartbeats suddenly go up from sixty to eighty, then fall back to normal. And he doesn't seem to be making any fuss, unlike that German I told you about ‚Äî nothing at all, very simple, very nice.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2319">Sometimes people went to him only once, and he got worried, wondering why the person hadn't come again ‚Äî "Yes, I was cured!"

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2352"><em>A Christian atmosphere of sin, basically.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2353">That's why I wanted you to see him, because naturally, F.'s impression is very good, and Pavitra, when he read the letter, was full of exclamations. As for me, I was like that (<em>withdrawn gesture</em>), on my guard.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2354">Why does he want to come?... Naturally, it might simply mean that he is very happy and content here ‚Äî that would be quite all right. But of course he is very much a Christian, and doesn't intend to change that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2355">I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2356">I wanted to ask you to see him because of that ... slightly painful impression, I don't know. And I didn't want to write to him, "Yes, you may stay," if it is to end in something unpleasant. But it may not, if he is conscious ‚Äî if he is conscious, it won't. You understand, to magnify the thing, in the name of their religion they betray their soul. That's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2357">If he is conscious of the Possibility, then it will be fine. Because at least he will be on his guard.... But I haven't seen him, I only saw his photo, and the first contact with the photo was like this: "Be careful...."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2358"><em>I also had a recoil. But I put it down to prejudices. I don't trust my feelings, you understand, in my life I've had such abhorrence of this Christianity....</em></p>

<p class="p-num">Page 314</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2360"><em>No, he was in civilian clothes. But I tell you, the impression was that underneath it hasn't been spiritually cultivated.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2361">Well, see him. I'd like you simply to tell me yes or no, that is, "Favourable impression" or "Unfavourable impression," something simple, one sentence, so that accordingly I may send him a line to tell him, "You may stay," or "It would be better if you didn't stay."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2362"><em>But in the end, even so, he will find himself faced with the same eternal problem: religion versus freedom.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2363">That's simply from the intellectual standpoint. Because if he isn't a philosopher, if he doesn't live in ideas, it doesn't matter at all: it's rather a question of EXPERIENCE.... It seems that the experience he had<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="124" href="#">3</a> was a "descent of Ananda," something he had never felt before, which came to him all of a sudden. Then he told his Superior, "I'd like to go all alone into solitude, to the countryside," because he didn't like rites, ceremonies and all that. So that was the starting point, and then he felt the need to come to India. And in India he travelled all around, until he came here. He has been in Orders for only two or three years, it's a recent conversion (not "conversion" from a religious standpoint but from the standpoint of life, because he must have been Catholic since his childhood, but he desired to leave life and become a monk), that's recent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2364">But it's a strange monastery, because Pavitra has had quite a sustained correspondence with an abbot who was in that monastery (he has a file this thick!), then it stopped abruptly, I don't know why.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2365">I don't feel this man is an intellectual, that's not the difficulty. But how to free them from the hold? That's the question.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2366"><em>Yes, it is. That's what I felt when I saw him: that thing which was there over him. It's a sort of "thing" common to all those people.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2368"><em>An atmosphere. It's an atmosphere ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2369">It's a collective suggestion, mon petit, and so strong, so strong!

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2371" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2372">At any rate, there is clearly an effort to come closer (I showed you the Pope's declaration). That's why if the time had come to undo that hold, it would be worth trying.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2373">That's simply why I leave the door open ‚Äî we'll see. For years I didn't concern myself with it, but since the Force is like this (<em>gesture of pressure</em>), building up and building up and building up (it's tremendous), all that will have to change at some time or other, so ... has the time come?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2374"><em>It's rather significant that for some time you've been seeing Catholics come to you from every side!</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2376"><em>That Mrs. Z, this monk ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2377">Oh, and then others who write.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2378">Yes, that's why: if he has a conscious goodwill, that is, if the hold is a subconscious affair... (I told you, he isn't a man with a mental power he needs to fight against, it's not that), but if he has a great goodwill, through him we may be able to do something. That's why I want you to see him.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2389"><em>And she would like you to tell your experience again.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2390">You know, I can never tell the same thing twice. It came (it wasn't my intention to tell her all that; my intention was to say a word or two, that: "All is well"), then it came, and so I spoke. But once it has come out, it's oven. I don't even know anymore what I told her.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2391">One thing I know. It's that I deliberately (I don't know if this is what she understood), I deliberately wanted her mother's departure to take place in the most harmonious possible conditions, with the least possible wastage, so she may retain the COMPLETE fruit of her passage in life here, and ... What I did in reality (but this I didn't tell her), from the moment I heard the news of her <em>stroke</em> (it was an apoplectic seizure), from the moment I heard the news I put her in a bath of the Lord. I kept her like this (<em>gesture of enfolding</em>). So, for me, first of all I knew that if she was to be cured, she would recover fairly quickly, and that if she didn't recover, it would show it was really time for her to go, but then she would go with ... her body benefiting, so to speak, the substance benefiting from all the good of physical life, and with her inner being in the best conditions. Of course, the inner being in the best conditions is the case for everyone, for all those who pass away here (but I generally don't have the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 317</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2392"> opportunity to let the inner being go out slowly, you understand<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="125" href="#">4</a>). I saw ... you know that when Sri Aurobindo left, we kept him for five days; I saw how it happened. I told you, while I stood beside him, it came out of his body and entered mine, and it was so material that there was a friction ‚Äî the body felt the friction of the Force entering. And I saw (of course, in that case it was quite different, tremendous, but for everybody it's like that), I saw this: for the departure to be as harmonious as possible, it should take place like that, according to an inner RHYTHM, with the Presence (which is both a protection and a help), the Presence of the divine Force. So I put her in that Presence. And even (I don't know if she told you), when her brother, who is a doctor came, he declared with their usual presumptuousness, "Oh, she'll be gone before tomorrow noon." I didn't say anything, I remained quiet. Naturally, three more days went by. And even he was forced to acknowledge that there was something there he didn't understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2393">What did she tell you?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2394"><em>She told me you had had a special experience with her mother, in the sense that the consciousness of the cells, the material consciousness of her body's cells, was able to leave along with the inner being, it wasn't lost.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2395">Yes, but that is the NORMAL thing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2396">It's the normal thing. But then, it takes time. And the result is that the whole benefit the cells have had isn't lost.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2398">Oh!... But she was buried. Oh, I know that. I know, I saw two or three cases here, people who were conscious ‚Äî it was horrible for them, frightful, frightful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2399">There was the case of C.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="126" href="#">5</a> He had learned to go out of his body, he knew how to do it: he would go about and see things; he would see, note things, and come back into his body. Then, when he was operated on, the doctors didn't take the necessary precautions and the heart couldn't withstand the shock of the operation: five days later, it was over. But he was in the habit of going out, so he went out and came to me (that's how I knew it before they came to tell me he was</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 318</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2400"> "dead" because he came to me). But he wasn't at all aware of being dead: he had gone out of his body as he used to, and he came to me, he was with me. So then, it was quite fine, he remained at peace. Then, at a certain point ... (he died in hospital, and naturally, at that time nobody listened to me: they burned him much too soon ‚Äî it would have been too soon anyway, because in his case, precisely because he had that practice, much precaution and time would have been required; but it was all rushed through), then all of a sudden, when they burned him (I didn't even know the time of the cremation), he suddenly came into my room, you know, terrified ... terrified, crying, miserable: "But I am dead! I didn't know I was dead, but I am dead and they've burned me, they've burned me!..." Oh ... it was horrible, horrible. So I calmed him down, told him to stay there, be calm, be with me, and that I would find him another body. And for a long, long time I had him consciously near me. Then I taught him to reincarnate ‚Äî it was all done in detail. So I know ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2401">The same thing with N.S. In his case also ... He had fallen on his head and fractured it (he fainted in the street, that's how he died). He was taken to the hospital. But he went out<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="127" href="#">6</a> and came to me right away (and so I knew: when I was told the accident had happened, I already knew something had happened because he had come to me). I kept him there, put him to rest, and he was quite peaceful ‚Äî quite peaceful. They didn't even consult me to know when he should be burned or anything (of course, a family of doctors!). Then, suddenly, brrt! (<em>gesture of bursting</em>) he went out of my atmosphere abruptly, like that. And no more sign of him.... It took me DAYS to recontact him ‚Äî and that was the shock he had when they burned his body. It took me days to find him again, put him back to rest, gather him together. And one part had disappeared; his whole consciousness didn't return, because a part of his most material consciousness, of the material vital, must have been thrown out by the shock. I know it, because Albert's<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="128" href="#">7</a> father was operated on (it was more than a year later, maybe two), and when he was chloroformed, he suddenly saw N.S. in front of him (of course, even a part can take on the appearance of the whole being, Sri Aurobindo has explained that, it's like a photograph). He saw N.S., and N.S. asked him for news of his family, news of his wife, news of his children, and he told him, "I worry about them." It must have been the part tied to his family, which must have been separated from the rest of his being: when he came to me, he was complete, but afterwards, I don't know what happened</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 319</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2402"> (<em>gesture of bursting under the shock</em>). And it was so concrete that when Albert's father was woken up again, he said aloud, "But why are you cutting short my conversation with N.S.?" That's how they found out. He told them, "But I was talking with N.S., why have you interrupted my conversation?" So they found out what had happened.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2404"><em>(Sujata speaks out:) Sweet Mother, I too saw N.S.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2411">That's what I said to T. (I don't think she understood), I told her that there isn't so much difference between what men call "life" and what</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2458">Yes. Oh, but they aren't the only ones to do that. As a matter of fact, all the old things seem to be swelling up as much as they can so as not to disappear. I received today a greeting card from a former disciple.... (<em>Mother looks for the card</em>) His name was A.C., an Israelite who was here and then went to England. In England he belonged for a long time to the "Sri Aurobindo Group," then when the war between Israel and Egypt broke out (or a little before), he became fanatical, a fanatical Israelite: "I want to work for Israel alone." And as he had been contacted about Auroville, he answered, "Can Auroville help Israel?" Things of that sort. And right now, it's the New Year there, so he sent me this (<em>Mother shows a card with seven candles illuminating the world, and wheat sheaves</em>). In the past, he called me The Divine Mother, and Sri Aurobindo was <em>The Lord</em>. Then in his last letter, it was "Guru" (I have become the guru!), and, <em>"I want to inform you that I have left the group."</em> And now he sends me this card: <em>"To the Mother... God bless You"</em> (<em>Mother laughs</em>). And it's the same thing, of course! Over there, few people are religious, they have a much more</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 324</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2459"> practical mind, but he has the religious temperament, so now it has become like this (<em>Mother puffs out her cheeks</em>), his Judaism is swelling up. The seven lights and the sheaves of prosperity.... I found it touching: <em>"God bless You"</em> (<em>Mother laughs</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2460">I remember, long ago, right at the beginning (I think I had just moved into Sri Aurobindo's house), someone, I forget who (did Tagore have a sister?...<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130" href="#">1</a>), she was a tall and strong woman, rather awe-inspiring, who had come to spend a day in the Ashram, and she said to me, "Why don't you keep some rooms and rent them out to visitors? You would get ten rupees a day." (<em>Mother laughs</em>) I stared at her, I was flabbergasted (she was teaching me to be practical!). And at the end, she said, <em>"God bless you."</em> At that point I couldn't restrain myself, and I answered her, <em>"It's already done!"</em> (<em>Mother laughs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2461">So it's the same thing everywhere, <em>a patronizing attitude</em>.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2485">This morning I had a visit from Durga. She pays me a visit every year, but this morning it was interesting because she explained to me her point of view, how she feels existence, and at the same time.... You know that she came last year, I told you the story. (Previously, when I used to go downstairs to give darshan, she would not only come but stay there for the whole time.) But when she came last year I told her, "Very good, it's very good, you fulfil your universal function very well, but you are missing something...." And I explained to her what it means to be in conscious and attentive contact with the Supreme Will and she understood. She understood and adhered, she said yes. And during the year she must have tried, because when she returned this morning, there was really a difference, especially a difference in the understanding, and she explained it to me. Then I spoke to her about the physical human nature and its infirmity, and she told me, "There is in this body something we ‚Äî all of us up above ‚Äî do not have and cannot have: the possibility of a constant Presence and of a constant contact with the Divine." She had never thought of it before! It is since last year. And she said it with such intensity ‚Äî such intensity and understanding and meaning.... It was as though all human miseries immediately disappeared in front of this EXTRAORDINARY thing ‚Äî that one could feel the divine Presence in each cell.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2486">It was really interesting. The morning was really interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2487">She stayed here while I was bathing, and she told me, "See, you can do all this, and not for a minute, not for a second do you lose the contact with That, with the supreme wonder. And we who are full of power, and of ... without any of your petty miseries, any of your petty difficulties, we are so used to our way of being that we don't see the value of it, it's something obvious, almost inevitable." And she said (<em>Mother smiles</em>), "We never think of the Divine, because we ARE the Divine.... So there isn't that will to progress, that thirst for ever better, ever more ‚Äî we totally lack it."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2488">It was really interesting. I am putting it into words (of course, she didn't speak to me in French!), but it was very simple, the contact was very simple (<em>gesture of inner exchange</em>), and very natural, very spontaneous. At one point I even asked her (<em>laughing</em>), "Do you enjoy all this worship people give you?" She said no. "No, I don't care." She is too used to it, she doesn't care.</p>

I told her (<em>laughing</em>), "Neither do I!" Then she asked me questions (very intelligent ones, mind you), and I answered her. But there was one thing about the selection of people and admissions to Auroville ... I told her that naturally, the essential condition to be able to select people was that preferences, attractions and repulsions, likes and dislikes, all moral rules, all of that must have completely disappeared ‚Äî not that one should be on the way to overcoming it, it's not that: it must have disappeared (<em>laughing</em>), there must be no more ego! Then I told her, "It's not a judgment, it's not that you look at people and judge whether they are fit to be there or not, if they are destined to be there or not, it's not that at all ‚Äî you don't 'judge'...."

I said yes, everything is always according to hierarchy, especially all conscious individuals, but there is no arbitrary will that classes them: it's the people themselves who spontaneously take their place without knowing it, the place they must have. It's not, I told her, it's not a decision, we don't want categories: this category, that category, and so this person will go here, that person will go there ‚Äî </p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2547"><em>Soon afterwards</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2548">All of a sudden, yesterday afternoon towards evening (around six, or a little before), there came a sort of atmosphere of ... (what should I call it?) a kind of discouraged pessimism in which everything had become lacklustre, grey, dissatisfied. When you see things from above, in a certain atmosphere of totality, each thing plays its part and collaborates in a general manifestation, but there, it was like something shut in itself, with no reason to be except that it was. It had neither aim, nor motive nor reason to be, neither was it a special circumstance or a particular event: it was a kind of self-enclosed formation, a state of being which was obviously morbid, but not violent, nothing violent.... Yes, in which each and everything was without reason or aim, without any satisfaction ‚Äî neither oneself nor others, nor things. And I was DELIBERATELY shut in it, in order to feel it. The consciousness wondered, "Why? What does it mean? Why is it like this?" And at the same time (you know that yesterday was the day of "Durga's Victory" for those who worship Durga), so I asked myself, "Why does she choose to shut me in this state just on the day of victory? What does it mean? What does it mean?..." It was indeed like a factual demonstration of the perfect uselessness of that way of being, which had no reason to be, which could be turned to anything, any time, without reason and without motive. It was like the symbol of disgruntled uselessness. But it went on.... I looked and looked at it, trying to find the slightest clue to the cause of that state: what, when, who, how? ... And the curious thing is that it's very, very foreign to my nature, because even when I was in real trouble, I</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 334</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2549"> never wasted my time being like that. And it went on, as things go on when I have to study them, understand them, and do what needs to be done. Then, at a certain point I said to myself, "Oh, perhaps this is what Durga intends to conquer this year?" And at the same time I remembered (like that, far away on the fringes of the consciousness), I remembered the time when Sri Aurobindo was there; every year, on the "Victory day," I would tell him, "Well, this is what Durga has done this year," and he would corroborate it. I would say, "This is what Durga has conquered, this is what Durga ..." Every year, over a long time. And so that memory was there, far away in the light, as if to tell me, "See, do you remember that?" And I said to myself, "Well, this may be what Durga wants to conquer?" Then I thought, "But what's to be conquered in this? It's silly!" It's a silly state. (Lots of people are in that state, I know, but it's absolutely silly, it has neither reason nor cause nor aim, it's like something that comes in without one knowing how or why.) It went on for a good while (I don't remember exactly how long). Then, when I had seen clearly, understood clearly what it was, I asked Durga, "Is this what you want to do?..." And it was suddenly as if ... a very strange thing, as if it evaporated before my eyes, pfft!... It went like this (<em>gesture of bursting</em>), and then ... I tried and tried ‚Äî the memory of it and everything had completely vanished! In one second it had completely gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2550">While it was there, it was ... yes, as if something without any truth in itself, something that didn't rest on any truth. A morose, dissatisfied, grumpy state, and it was grey, grey, grey, lacklustre, looking at everything from the angle of uselessness and stupidity. Then there was a sort of bursting: all of a sudden, poff! like that, and it was all over. And now it's a sort of vague memory which I can hardly recapture, which no longer exists.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2551">When it came, I said (<em>laughing</em>), "What a victory!" Then came the memory, the vision of Sri Aurobindo's time, and the impression, "Well, is this" (Durga was there, watching), "is this what you want to vanquish?" She didn't answer me, she smiled. And a few minutes later, poff! (<em>same gesture of bursting</em>), like that, I don't know how to explain it. But it was strange, I had never seen that before.... The other times, when Sri Aurobindo was there, whenever she overcame something, the impression was of a power surrounding a falsehood (<em>gesture as if to pull out a tuft of grass</em>), surrounding it like that, forcibly isolating it, paralyzing it and taking all support away from it; but this time ... it was an odd phenomenon. Something totally nonexistent, without any truth in it. And all that way of being was as if hanging over the earth, in contact with certain people, but as</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 335</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2552"> if wrapped inside a bag: you understand, it had no contact with the rest, but once you were inside it, impossible to get out! You were shut in, it was impossible. Then it burst all at once: "Ah!..." And nothing was left.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2553">It was interesting in that it was the first time I was the witness to such a thing. And really it was as if I tried to feel, to touch it ‚Äî I tried, but there was nothing left! It was oppressive, you know: you tried to get out of it, but it was impossible ‚Äî you were shut in, a slave, powerless.</p>

And what a humanity, mon petit!... In fact, all those who come are generally the malcontents. Now and then, one of them has a light in his eyes and a need for something he hasn't found (then it's very good). There are those that weren't successful in anything and are completely disgusted, so they wonder if they might not be successful there. Then there are the old ones who have worked hard and want to rest. There are very few young people ‚Äî the few young people are all people of worth (the ordinary youth aren't interested). And the few youth I have seen are those who want to work: they don't want to come and take advantage of others' work, they want to work. So we'll soon have a rather interesting team. But (<em>laughing</em>) with the well-fed old ones, I ... <em>postpone decision, put under observation</em> (<em>Mother laughs</em>). Yesterday, there were a number of them like that. We'll see: if they want to be useful, that is, give money or things, or propose to do something, then we'll see; but those such as the well-fed gentleman, or the well-established fat lady who want to come and spend the rest of their lives in peace, to them we say, "Wait a bit, we'll see!"</p>

Some are so eager to come that they send money in advance, and when there's some life or something in them, I accept them.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2560">(<em>Mother studies the photo</em>) It's amusing. When I look back at all those things, I have a very acute sensation of looking at my childhood, it all seems to me so childish!... Still in the illusion of the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2561">And since how many years?... Since something like 1915, I felt ‚Äî constantly felt ‚Äî I was acting on the Command: the Command from above. The personal impulsion had disappeared. Since as long as that, 1915, and in that condition, there has been a whole evolution and transformation. And now, when I look back, not only all I used to do, but the way of looking at things, especially the way of looking at things ... [seems childish to me]. The reaction was already like this (<em>wide-open, even gesture</em>), because great care had been taken to correct any ignorant reaction; the reaction was already very much like this (<em>same wide open gesture</em>), but it was VOLUNTARILY so, not spontaneously so. That's the great difference. You understand, that sort of universal equality like this (<em>same gesture</em>) was voluntary, it was the effect of a constant vigilance and a constant will. Now also the vigilance is constant, but it's replaced by the vigilance and will to be constantly like this (<em>Mother turns the two palms of her hands upward, like a bowl and forming an upside-down triangle at the level of her forehead</em>), all the time like this inwardly, turned inward, as though each cell were turned inward, towards its centre of light ‚Äî that's how it is. And there is still a vigilance not to forget, not to flag ‚Äî all the cells turned inward towards That. So all that outward play, oh, how childish it all looks! And now I do things that are far more childish, lots of little things that are, to the ordinary human outlook, totally</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 337</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2562"> useless and quite childish ‚Äî but all that isn't the same thing ... it's ... (<em>a vast, supple, slow gesture</em>) like the waves and rhythm of a divine Harmony expressing itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2563">I might put it like this: at the time of this declaration (<em>of 1954</em>), I was still taking things seriously. At the time of the "classes," when I spoke, I was taking all those things seriously.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2564">Now it's not indifference, it's ... I don't know, words can't express it, because "detachment" wouldn't be correct. I don't know, there are no words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2565">There is certainly a kind of perception that mankind has given gravity, importance, and ... It's obviously the mental structure, all that the mind has added in the world: first, differences in value, differences in importance, then a kind of solemnity, and, yes, gravity, an importance, a dignity.... All those things. All that is the mind's addition to life. And now it makes me smile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2566">Like peoples' need of a cult, the religious feeling, that sort of <em>awe</em> (what's the word in French?... Fear, terror?) before the divine Power ‚Äî all of that is what the mind has brought into life ‚Äî now it makes me smile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2567">When people come and see me with that sort of graveness, when they come like that, I instantly feel like bursting into laughter! So I laugh, I smile, I welcome them like old friends! (<em>Mother laughs</em>) Voil√†.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2570">Not this year, but it says there will be a terrible battle before the second coming of Christ.... I know nothing about that myself! But a lady disciple in Holland has written a letter: it seems everyone there is terror-stricken, there's panic all over the country (!) and they say it's the year of the battle. And here in India (not concertedly, of course), astrologers have said that September and October are months of a terrible battle (maybe not a war, but a battle) between Truth and Falsehood. There in Holland, it seems it's like in the year 1000: they</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 338</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2571"> gather for meditations, entreaties, collective prayers.... Well. And here, it's the same thing, they are panic-stricken.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2572">But battle there is. You can't move a finger without waging a battle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2573">I'll give you a very down-to-earth example: the government owes me 175,000 rupees, I absolutely need it, it's six months since they should have given it. Two weeks ago, they sent me a paper to tell me, "Here it comes." I was relieved because I had payments to make before the end of the month. But the paper was just the promise of a check, and now all payments are over, they've stopped paying for this year!... That sort of thing, you understand, and EVERYTHING is like that. If I didn't need money, I wouldn't care, but it's "Deepavali,"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="132" href="#">1</a> then a house to be paid for, and one thing coming on top of another. So that's how it is: for the smallest thing you have to wage a battle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2574">It's like with Auroville: a whole part of the government is absolutely enthusiastic, but there are three or four individuals here, in Madras State, who are dead against, and they have a terrible action: they stop everything.

That kind of lie, you understand, everywhere.</p>

As for me, I see it, so it doesn't matter ‚Äî I see it, I even see the nature of it, the suggestions it gives and so on. It comes with such power that I am compelled to see it ‚Äî I see.

After fifty or fifty-five days (the whole family was around her, but her son had gone to work), all of a sudden after fifty-five days, because her son had left, she started calling for him, shouting frantically! (<em>Laughing</em>) I think they all had a scare.... And the usual stupid remarks: "She was unconscious." I said, "Good God! But why do you say she was unconscious, you know nothing about it!... She can't express herself, but she isn't unconscious." She is entirely conscious, only the means of</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 343</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2613"> expression are damaged, she can no longer use them. And I made a long speech on the subject, but there was no one to record it and I can never say the same thing twice. It came clearly (Sri Aurobindo was there), and with the absolutely clear picture of what death is.... Now I can't repeat it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2614">In reality, to put it practically (but it's not any longer the thing), what people call "death" is when the instrument of expression ‚Äî the instrument of connection with the milieu, and of expression ‚Äî has deteriorated to the point where it can no longer be used, and so there comes a moment when the consciousness ... abandons it. Probably for all sorts of reasons (there must be different reasons in each case), but the consciousness abandons it because it can no longer be used.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2615">But yesterday it came well; now it's nothing. It was lived. Lived, and so clear, so concrete, so obvious, it was, "But men know nothing, nothing, nothing at all!..." Only now it sounds like a platitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2616" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2617">The vision was so clear (not vision: lived, the experience), it was so clear that it contained in itself the purpose of the creation. You could see the work of the consciousness to permeate the inconscient and make it progressively more capable of manifesting the consciousness (<em>gesture like a flower rising out of the earth</em>), with increasing complications, but the complications are the result of the inability of the inconscient ‚Äî of inconscient matter ‚Äî which adds <em>one device to another</em> in the hope of reconstructing the supreme Possibility. Then, through all those complications, and as the substance becomes increasingly permeated with consciousness, the need for "devices" will diminish, and we will be able to return to the higher Simplicity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2618">But all that was lived, seen ‚Äî seen, and so clear!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2619" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2620">And in each "life," as men call it ‚Äî that is to say, the utilisation of a portion of matter organized in what we call a body ‚Äî how that utilisation aims at the greatest possibility of manifestation (reception and manifestation) of the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2621">Naturally, this can be done because even in the inconscient, at its very bottom, there is consciousness; but that's philosophy. Yesterday, it was the perfectly concrete and material experience of it all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2622">And individualization is part of the process, it's a necessity of the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 344</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2623"> process, because it permits a more minute and direct action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2624">And when Matter will be supple enough to be transformed under the action of the consciousness ‚Äî a CONSTANT transformation ‚Äî then this need to abandon there something that has become useless, or is in impossible conditions, will no longer exist. That is how it may happen, at least for the requirements of the transformation, to have at will a continuity, of existence for a form which was transitional.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2625">But yesterday, the impression was that it [death] is now only an old habit, no longer a necessity. It's only because ... First of all, because the body is still unconscious enough to (how should I put it?), not to "desire," because that's not the word, but to feel the need of total rest, that is, inertia. When that is abolished, there is no disorganization that cannot be mended, or in any case (the field of accidents hasn't been studied, but in the normal course of things), no wear and tear, no deterioration, no disharmony that cannot be mended by the action of the consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2626">It's only this residue (a considerable one), this residue of inconscient that asks for rest (<em>gesture of dissolution</em>). What it calls rest is the state of inertia, that is to say, the refusal to manifest the consciousness. It's only that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2627">There is also that FORMIDABLE collective suggestion ... weighing down. That suggestion of ageing ... ageing, wearing out and death ("death," anyway what they call death, which isn't dying ‚Äî what does "dying" mean? Annulment does not exist, nothing is annulled), but anyway, giving up the form because the form refuses to be transformed (that's nearly what it is) and isn't receptive, it accepts a progressive deterioration because of the formidable weight of the collective suggestion ‚Äî the habit of millennia: "It's always been like that, that's that." The great argument. Which isn't true, besides.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2628">But there is such idiocy in this body. For instance, there is at each moment (each second or minute), at each moment there is the choice between the continuation of the old habit or progress towards consciousness. It's constantly like that. And through ... (what can I call it?) sloppiness (what is it? ... It's not bad will because it's idiotic; it's more idiotic than bad will), there is a spontaneous tendency to choose deterioration rather than the effort of progress, and it's only when there is something like a slightly awakened consciousness that says, "You silly fool! You've gone through many more difficulties than the little difficulty of making an effort of progress," then that has some weight ‚Äî not always.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2629">There is a sort of passive knowledge (not that the body doesn't know how it is, it knows how it is ‚Äî it's sloppiness), but when it knows</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 345</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2630"> and makes the effort, it is always, every time, expressed as lights, yes, like vibratory waves, and those of progress are the ones which have all the colours, that stippling of all the colours: a light made of a stippling of all the colours. Those are the lights that choose the immediate little effort to reject the sloppiness.... But they are not important events: it's something going on each minute, for everything, all the time, all the time, all the time ‚Äî for everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2631">It must be a phase. I don't know how long that phase will last, but it must be a phase because it's obviously a transitional state. And then, when there is that inner aspiration, oh!... I have seen the cells, I've seen them saying like this, "Oh, will there be a possibility to be You effortlessly?" Then there comes such a marvellous Response! For a few seconds it's ... (<em>blissful gesture</em>), then the old routine starts up again.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2632">But the great difficulty is mental observation: the observing mind (not a personal mind: an observing Mind), and that makes things much more difficult. If one can keep the mind busy, it's easier. Because the mind is something extremely hard, dry, positive, phew! and logical, reasonable ‚Äî it's dreadful. Dreadful. And yet, to put things at their best, the general waves are full (especially now, in our time) full of doubt ‚Äî such a foul and obstinate doubt! They treat all this as fantastic imagination.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2633">You are led to tell the mind, "I'd rather be mistaken this way than be mistaken in your way."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2634" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2635">Then, in the psychological makeup, there are all those old things that come from human atavism: you must be reasonable, prudent, perspicacious ... you must take precautions, be provident, oh!... The whole fabric of ordinary human equilibrium. It's so sordid. And it's like that, the whole mentalization of the cells is like that, full of that, and not only in your own way of being, according to your own experience, but in the way of being of your parents, grandparents, the people around, and ... oh!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2654">But you know I see more and more how horrible the mind's action in life is. Of course, <em>in the long run</em>, at the end of the curve, the mind will bring a precision and accuracy that didn't exist without it, but men come to regard that precision and accuracy as the truth, and that has spoilt everything. When it becomes nothing more than an INSTRUMENT of manifestation, it will be very useful. But for the moment it's still ... I am beginning to see in small details how its action is to add something to the manifestation, but in its daily labour it's horrible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2655">And people flood me with questions more and more ‚Äî a flood, at the rate of twenty-five, thirty, forty letters a day, and on top of it all, not even two are worthwhile; even those are from beginners trying to find the way, so you can give them a little <em>push</em>, like that. Otherwise I take great care to keep the mind quiet.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 348</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2656">Anyway, we can see this boy's notebook (<em>the notebook of a young disciple who regularly puts questions to Mother</em>). What does he ask?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2657"><em>"Sweet Mother, why are we, in the Ashram itself, inclined to create small groups and societies, such as 'World Union', 'New Age', etc.? What is their purpose?"</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2658">Purpose! (<em>Laughing</em>) Do they have a purpose?... I'll simply answer him, "Because men are fond of forming groups." Quite simply, nothing else to say.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2659" style="text-align: right;">(<em>Mother writes, then stops; after a silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2660">I am going to shock him a bit, no?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2661"><em>Yes.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2662" style="text-align: right;">(<em>Mother finishes writing and holds out the notebook</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2663">"Because men still imagine that in order to do anything useful, they must gather together in groups. It is the caricature of organization."</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2664">It will do, won't it?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2665">World Union!... They really did imagine they were going to make humanity progress!... But when I tell people that the creation of a city like Auroville has more weight in the earth's history than all the groups in the world, they don't believe me. They don't believe me, to them it's totally unimportant, a fancy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2666">Once I asked Sri Aurobindo (because we had talked about Auroville a great deal, there were lots of difficulties), I asked him (because it was an idea I had ‚Äî not an "idea" but a need that expressed itself some thirty years ago ‚Äî more than thirty, almost forty years ago), so I asked him, and he answered me this (I think I told you): "<em>It is the best chance men have to avoid a general conflict.</em>"<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="133" href="#">1</a> There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2667">So, since he told me that, I have been working very seriously. Of course, it wasn't "said," it was SEEN.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2668">Only, I see quite clearly that they don't believe in it, there is no one</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 349</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2669"> who feels. So does it...? And the concrete materialization of the spirit of Auroville hasn't taken place yet, it doesn't exist, there isn't in the earth atmosphere a formation of the "spirit of Auroville," which is a spirit.... (<em>Mother remains absorbed for a long time</em>) At bottom it is: "The art of building unity out of complexity." Without uniformity, you understand: unity through harmony in complexity, with each thing in its place....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2670">It's very difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2671">When R. (<em>Auroville's architect</em>) was here last time, he said to me, "When are we going to create Auroville's atmosphere? Everyone is quarrelling!" (<em>Mother laughs</em>) I said, "Yes, that's the difficulty...." And it's continuing. But anyway, there is a Pressure from above, like that, a Pressure. We shall see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2672">It's still a symbol.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2673">Each little group thinks it is a symbol ‚Äî that too is a symbol.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2674">And as the formation descends in order to manifest, all oppositions rise up, contradictions rise up, complications come, and within you can clearly see that they don't understand. So I spend my time telling them, "Don't try to organize, don't try, you are going to fossilize the whole thing before it's begun."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2675">For my part, I wanted it to grow like that, spontaneously, with the full play of the unexpected. But then, you are confronted with all the rules and regulations: we are in a country [India] ‚Äî we should do it on a desert island! But that no longer exists on earth, there isn't an island left that doesn't belong to a nation ‚Äî we are caught, bogged down.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2676">Anyway, we'll muddle along as best we can.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2677">It's an attempt, that's all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2678">But what Sri Aurobindo meant was that the movement, the general movement was towards a catastrophe, and this was to divert the current of force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2679">But I have wondered whether the Tower of Babel, insofar as the story is true, wasn't a similar attempt, an attempt to harmonize men?... It's presented to us the other way round, but I have wondered if it wasn't that.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2680">We'll see.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2681">Now there is integrally, even for the most material consciousness, the body consciousness, this: to leave the entire responsibility to the Lord ‚Äî what He wants will be, and that's all. When He wants us to do something, we do it, but after all ... We do it simply because He tells us to do it. And what will happen will happen. Then, if you want to know, you put yourself in the attitude of the Witness and look on. And that's very amusing! As soon as you are in the attitude of the Witness,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 350</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2682"> it becomes very interesting ‚Äî very interesting ‚Äî and you smile.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2683">That's how it is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2684">The body too has learned to be like that for the smallest things. Then it's fine.</p>

Now, of course, the consciousness is there at least to a great extent; so things are moving much faster, that is, the greater part of the work is done. But still, as I said, when you see to what extent we are bound to Unconsciousness, to a semi-vague consciousness, and how those who don't know still feel "fatality," "fate," what they call "Nature" and all that dominates and governs them, well, for the final change to take place, all that must become fully conscious, and not merely in the mental way ‚Äî that's not enough ‚Äî but in the divine way!

Then the cells aspire, there is a sort of central consciousness of the body which aspires intensely, with as complete a <em>surrender</em> as it can make: "Your Will, Lord, Your Will, Your Will...."

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2822">One or two days ago, I don't know, there was a sort of general vision of this striving of the earth towards its divinization, and someone seemed to be saying (not "someone": it was the witness-consciousness, the consciousness observing, but it gets formulated in words ‚Äî very often it's formulated in English and I have a kind of impression that it is Sri Aurobindo, his active consciousness, but sometimes it gets translated into words only in my consciousness), and these last few days, it was something saying, "Yes, the time of proclamations, the time of revelations is past ‚Äî now, on to action."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2823">Proclamations, revelations, prophecies, all that is after all very comfortable, it gives a sense of something "concrete"; now it's very obscure, there is a sense that it's very obscure, invisible (it will be visible only in results far, far ahead), and not understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2824">Not understood, of course.... Someone, C., wanted to translate <em>Notes on the Way</em> and <em>A Propos</em> into Hindi, in one volume. He spoke to R. about it, and R. wrote to me, "People don't understand anything," and he feels "the human language is unfit to express that, so how will it turn out in a translation? ‚Äî A platitude. It would be better to wait." I fully agree, I told him it would be better to wait. But it gave me the exact measure. Because R. and C. are people who are <em>expected to understand</em>, and they clearly don't understand anything. And then, Nolini was there, I gave him the letter to read, and he said, "Oh, yes!" ‚Äî For him too it's the same thing, he hasn't understood! So it's general. Because many people quote to me what I have said, or experiences they've had, explanations they give "in accordance with" those <em>Notes on the Way</em>, and every time I see that they haven't understood ANYTHING.</p>

Precisely because it's not mental, it's nearly incomprehensible, and for it all to become (oh, it's visible), for it all to become accessible, it would take just (<em>same gesture</em>) a slight reversal in the mind, and then it would become prophetic.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2866">And this physical mind, which Sri Aurobindo said was an impossibility, that it was something that goes round in circles and would go on turning round forever, without consciousness, precisely, like a sort of machine, this physical mind has been converted, it has fallen silent, and in silence it has received inspiration from the Consciousness. And it has started praying again: the same prayers that were earlier in the mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2867"><em>I quite understand all that can take place in you, but ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2868">But since it's taking place in one body, it can take place in all bodies! I am not made of anything different from others.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2869">And it was as stupid, as obscure, as unconscious, as stubborn as all the other bodies in the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2870">It began when the doctors declared I was seriously ill, that was the beginning.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="139" href="#">2</a> Because the entire body was emptied of its habits and forces, and then, slowly, slowly, the cells woke up to a new receptivity and opened directly to the divine Influence.</p>

One can see it, you know, one sees it: one just has to open one's eyes to see it. Well, the same thing is now taking place: for the animal to become a man, it didn't take anything more than the infusion of a consciousness ‚Äî a mental consciousness ‚Äî and now, it's the awakening of that consciousness which was there, deep down, in the very depths. The mind has withdrawn, the vital has</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 372</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2873"> withdrawn, everything has withdrawn; when I was supposedly ill, the mind had gone away, the vital had gone away, and the body was left to itself ‚Äî purposely. And that's why, it's precisely because the vital and mind had gone that it looked like a very serious illness. And then, in the body left to itself, the cells little by little started awakening to the consciousness (<em>gesture of a rising aspiration</em>); once those two had gone, the consciousness which had been infused into the body THROUGH the vital (from the mind to the vital and from the vital to the body) started slowly, slowly emerging. It began with that burst of Love right at the top, from the extreme, supreme altitude; then, little by little, little by little, it came down to the body. Then that sort of physical mind, that is, something totally and completely idiotic going round and round in circles, forever repeating the same thing over and over again, became clear little by little and grew conscious, organized, then fell silent. And then in that silence, the aspiration expressed itself in prayers.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2875">It's a denial of all the spiritual assertions of the past: "If you want to live fully conscious of the divine life, leave your body ‚Äî the body cannot follow."

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2876">The work remains to be done.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2877">But now there is a certitude. The result is still very far ‚Äî very far off, there is much to do before the crust, the outermost surface experience as it is, can manifest what takes place within (not "within" in the spiritual depths: within in the body). For it to be able to manifest what is within ... That will come last, which is very good because if it came earlier, we would neglect the work; we would be so happy that we'd forget to complete the work. Everything must have been done within, everything must be fully and thoroughly changed, then the outside will express it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2878">But it's all ONE SINGLE substance, the very same everywhere, which was unconscious everywhere; and so, the remarkable thing is that things are taking place AUTOMATICALLY (<em>gesture of points scattered throughout the world</em>), completely unexpected things, here and there, even in people who don't know anything.</p>

The previous descent was a mental one, while this is what Sri Aurobindo calls a "supramental descent"; the impression is, a descent of the supreme Consciousness infusing itself into something capable of receiving and manifesting it. Then, out of that, once it has been thoroughly kneaded (there's no knowing how much time it will take), a new form will be born, which will be the form Sri Aurobindo called supramental ‚Äî it will be ... no matter what, I don't know what those beings will be called.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2882">What will be their mode of expression? How will they make themselves understood and so on? ... In man, it developed very slowly. Only, mind has done a lot of kneading and, after all, has made things advance faster.</p>

When you make music or when you paint, you very clearly perceive how the consciousness permeates the cells and those cells become conscious. This experience, for example: there are objects in a box, and you say to your hand, "Take twelve of them." The hand goes like that, without your bothering about it, and it finds the twelve (without counting, just like that), it takes the twelve and gives them to you. That's an experience I had long ago; when I was twenty I began with experiences of that kind, consequently I know, I knew how the consciousness works. You understand, it's impossible to learn the piano or painting without the consciousness coming into the hands, and the hands become conscious INDEPENDENTLY of the brain ‚Äî the brain may be busy elsewhere, it doesn't matter in the least.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2903"> what happens in those people we call "sleepwalkers": they have a consciousness belonging to their body, which makes them move about and do things quite independently of the mind and the vital.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2905">No! It's THE BODY that ends up saying the mantra spontaneously! So spontaneously that even if you happen to be thinking of something else, your body will be saying the mantra. Don't you have that experience?</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2908">But now I understand, I understand very well!

I wondered why, whether it was a transitional phase. But now I understand: cut off ‚Äî I would keep fainting. What made the doctor declare that I was ill is that I couldn't take a step without fainting: if I wanted to walk from here to there, poff! I would faint on the way; I had to be held so that my body wouldn't fall down. So the doctor's decision: to bed and no moving. But on my part, not for one minute did I lose consciousness! I would faint but remain conscious, I would see my body and know I had fainted; I didn't lose consciousness, the body didn't lose consciousness. So now I understand! The body was cut off from the vital and the mind and left to its own means; and then little by little, little by little ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2909">I remember, for instance, all that the doctors do: they give you vitamins, this and that. All right. So as soon as I had taken those vitamins, I saw that sort of physical mind start stirring and stirring and stirring: "Vitamins," I said, "I don't want them, they excite the brain." Then they changed and gave me something at another time, and that was good. And all that, all of it was simply THE BODY: all</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 376</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2910"> that it knew, all the experiences it had had, all the mastery from what was in all the states of being, from the vital to the mind and above, all of that was gone! And this poor body was left to itself. Then, naturally, little by little something was rebuilt. For a long time I remained unable ... unable to do hardly anything (a little bit, but hardly anything), but gradually it was all rebuilt, rebuilt, rebuilt: a conscious, purely conscious being ‚Äî which is now chattering away! (It was unable to express itself.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2911">Yes, I understand. I understand. Well, perhaps that is what Sri Aurobindo meant when he said to me, "Your body is at present the only one on earth that can do this work." I thought it was a kindness on his part.... But it's true that it was cut off, I knew it ‚Äî I saw it ‚Äî cut off, the states of being were sent away: "Go away, you are not wanted anymore." Then the body had to rebuild a life for itself. And instead of having to go through all those states of being as it did before, through successive awakenings (<em>gesture of ascent from degree to degree, in the way of the yogis of old</em>), right to the top, the topmost beyond the form, now it's no longer that at all, the body no longer needs anything of all that, it simply has ... (<em>gesture of a rising aspiration opening out like a flower</em>). Something within opened and developed, which caused that idiotic mind to become organized and capable of falling silent in an aspiration. And then ... then there was the direct Contact, without intermediaries ‚Äî the direct contact. That it now has constantly. Constantly, constantly, constantly, the direct contact. And it's THE BODY: it doesn't go through all kinds of things and states of being, not at all, it's direct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2912">But once that has been done (this is something Sri Aurobindo had said), once ONE body has done it, it has the capacity of passing it on to others; and I tell you, there is now (I am not saying in its totality and in detail, probably not), but here and there (<em>scattered gesture to show various points on earth</em>) people suddenly get one experience or another. Some of them (the majority) get frightened, so naturally it goes away ‚Äî that is because they weren't prepared enough within (if it's not the little routine of every minute, always the same, they get frightened), and once they get frightened it's over, it means they will need years of preparation for the experience to recur. But still, some aren't; frightened; suddenly, an experience: "Ah!..." something wholly new, wholly unexpected, which they had never thought of.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2913">It's contagious. That I know. And it's the only hope, because if everyone had to go through the same experience again ...

Or when there is no answer right away, sometimes (often) I put it aside, and when I am alone, Sri Aurobindo comes and says to me, "Why don't you tell him this?" Then I immediately write it down. It happens very often. And always an answer, oh, with a sense of ridiculousness, of humour, touching the exact point where the weakness or unconsciousness lies. It's very amusing. So I never try to find, naturally, never ever, it comes like that quite simply. When I have to answer, it comes; then I just have to take a paper, my pen, and I write it down.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2965"><em>"Sweet Mother, in the Bulletin you said, 'Psychic memories ... are unforgettable moments of life when the consciousness is intense, luminous, strong, active, powerful, and sometimes also turning points in your life which gave it a new orientation. But never will you be able to describe the dress you wore or the gentleman with whom you spoke or the neighbours or the kind of field you were in.' (Questions and Answers of May 6, 1953) And regarding the memory of small details, you said, 'It's perfectly silly.'</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-2967">That's not a psychic memory. They always confuse things so dreadfully!</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3006">Strange. And it's becoming more and more like that. As the body catches hold of the inner rhythm, it keeps increasing.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3009">What is it? One day we'll know....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3010"><em>It's quite familiar.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3011">Yes. But my impression is like this: someone I knew very intimately, with whom I perhaps lived ‚Äî but not "me," you understand. That is, it's the body that says, "It's not me." Inwardly, it's quite different: there is no me-and-you, none of that exists; but the body still has it and says, "It's not me, it's someone I know very, very well, but it's not me."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3012"><em>Why does it come like that at the balcony?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3013">It may be two things. It may be that the original consciousness split into two in a past existence (it has happened several times) and manifested in two different bodies at the same time; and so naturally, there was an intimacy and probably a familiarity in life ‚Äî it</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 391</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3014"> may be something physical. But it may also be someone who exists permanently, a permanent form somewhere, with whom we are in constant contact in that world (the overmental or supramental world, or elsewhere), and the feeling "Oh, I know this" springs from within. It may be either of those two things ‚Äî I don't know which as yet.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3015">(<em>After a silence</em>) It's more an expression, a type of vibration, an atmosphere more than exact features. So it might rather be this: someone who exists permanently somewhere with whom we are in contact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3016">That would explain the sensation that we don't know whether it's a man or a woman: it must be from a sexless world, a world where there is neither man nor woman.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3017" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3018">The body itself has more than an impression, it's ... a sort of knowledge ‚Äî more than a knowledge, it's, well, a fact: there are lots and lots of beings, forces, personalities that manifest through it, at times even several at once. That's a very common experience. For instance, the experience that Sri Aurobindo is here, and that he speaks and sees, with his own way of seeing (<em>piercing and ironic gesture</em>) and his way of expressing himself ‚Äî that happens very often. Often too, it's Durga, or Mahakali, or ... very often. Often, what manifests is a being from very high up, very permanent ‚Äî very permanent ‚Äî and then there comes into the being a sort of absoluteness. At times, it's beings from a nearby plane trying to make themselves felt, to express themselves, but that's under control.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3019">The body is used to it, you understand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3020">But the strange thing was that this time, on the 24th, when I went to the balcony, it was someone ... (and that happens to me now and then, more and more frequently) someone looking on from a sort of plane of eternity, with, mingled in it, a great benevolence (something like benevolence, I don't know how to express it), but with an absolute calm, almost indifference, and the two are together looking on like that (<em>Mother draws waves far away below</em>), as though it were seen from far away, far above, far ... (how should I put it?) seen from such an eternal vision. That was what my body felt when I went out for the balcony. So the body said, "But I have to aspire, there must be an aspiration for the Force to descend on all these people!" And "That" was like that (<em>sovereign gesture above</em>), oh, so benevolent, but with a sort of indifference ‚Äî the indifference of eternity, I don't know how to explain it. And the body feels it all as something making use of it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3040">I saw you last night.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3041"><em>Oh, yes?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3042">Do you remember? ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3043"><em>No.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3044">We were in the subtle physical. I saw lots of people: Purani (<em>a departed disciple</em>) and so on, people who are no longer on earth. It was in Sri Aurobindo's ... not his house, but his domain. I saw and did lots of things. There were people who are on earth and people who are no longer on earth: they were all together. And at the end (for many details Sri Aurobindo was there, then he left), at the end I looked at all that, and for the first time in the subtle physical, I said, "Oh, how insipid and useless and without zest your life is, when you don't think of the Divine."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3045">The experience was so acute! So acute. Then I said (among the people there, there was Purani, and as I said people who are on earth), I told them, "On earth, there is that intensity of aspiration, but here ... life is so easy, so easy! Look at all your activities and all that, oh, it has no zest, because there isn't that intense need to live for the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 397</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3046"> Divine." And it was so strong that for hours in the morning it was like that (<em>gesture of intense aspiration</em>). Life anywhere ‚Äî anywhere, in any part of the world (of the universe) and in any conditions, even the easiest and harmonious, is not worth living without this intensity of aspiration, of the NEED to be divine.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3047">It's the first time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3048">In the past, when I went to all those regions, there were always very interesting things; and in the subtle physical, as a rule I was always with Sri Aurobindo ‚Äî I was with Sri Aurobindo, but he withdrew to a part of his domain and I remained with all the others: they had an easy life, you know, carefree, and all they did seemed so ... <em>meaningless</em>. Why? Why all that, why keep oneself busy, why do all those things if it's not for this aspiration, if it's not for this need to be and become the Divine?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3049">But it's the first time, and it lingered on: for hours this morning, I was like this (<em>gesture of intense aspiration</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3050">There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3051">As a result, my impression was that unless the whole universe becomes THAT, well ... what's the use? All, all that isn't Consciousness, the supreme consciousness, I mean, yes, supreme and supremely divine, all the rest ... It's the first time I've felt so intensely the uselessness of all outward activities ‚Äî their uselessness IN THEMSELVES, like a blossoming, because when there is the divine Play, then the same things become lovely, it all becomes interesting, but in themselves, for themselves, they are NOTHING. It's the first time I have felt that so intensely. Because I felt it in the subtle world (in the material world it's always mixed with all kinds of trouble and effort and difficulty, so it's completely different), there, things are absolutely free of difficulties, completely harmonious, really, and it was NOTHING. You understand, when Sri Aurobindo was there, it was perfect, but when he withdrew ... tasteless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3052">And it's the PHYSICAL consciousness that has those experiences at night: the body remains in trance, it's the physical consciousness; it was the physical consciousness, but in a subtle physical freed from all difficulties ‚Äî and it was no better. You know, it was like a reply to the ambition of people here on earth who want life to be pleasant, easy, without difficulties, without conflicts and clashes and diseases and ... they say, "Oh, how charming all would be!" ‚Äî It's not true: if THAT isn't there, empty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3053">The experience was very interesting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3055">I have a whole correspondence in French with S., who is learning French and puts questions to me. So (<em>Mother shows a sheet of paper</em>), here is the latest one, from yesterday, because I had told him a story:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3056">You know that I always keep a Transformation flower here (<em>Mother points to her buttonhole</em>); I keep it the whole morning, and when I take off my dress in the afternoon for a bath, the flower is naturally in a pitiful condition ‚Äî so I used to throw it away. But one day, S. had sent me roses in a glass of water, and it was on my dressing table; I took the Transformation flower and put it in the water, and when I came back from my bath it was magnificent, far fresher and stronger than when I had received it! I kept it the whole night, kept it the next day, it was unchanged! It remained just as fresh. Then the next day, I sent him the flower back in his glass, and when he came to see me in the afternoon, I told him the story. I said, "Did you get the Transformation flower? This is what happened...." The next day, he wrote me this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3057"><em>"Does the transformation not demand a very high degree of aspiration, surrender and receptivity?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3058">I replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3059">"The transformation demands a total and integral consecration. But is that not the aspiration of every sincere sadhak?<br/>
"'Total' means ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3060">Yes, it was on the following page (because I thought, "This man will wonder why I put 'total and integral' when the two words seem to mean the same thing"). So I gave him the explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3061">"'Total' means VERTICALLY in all the states of being from the most material to the most subtle. 'Integral' means HORIZONTALLY in all the various and often contradictory parts that make up the outer being (physical, vital and mental)."</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3062"><em>"How can I receive Sri Aurobindo's light in the mind?"</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3063">"It can always come if you aspire patiently. But the basic condition, if you want that light, is to get rid of all other mental influences."</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3064"><em>"What is the meaning of 'to get rid of all other mental influences'? Is it this that I had better not read any other books except Sri Aurobindo's or not try to learn anything by hearing or admiring others?"</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3067">This is something people don't generally know. It's very true, but they don't know it. When they start admiring all sorts of things, it becomes a hodgepodge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3068" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3069">This is one of the things I've learned lately by experience ‚Äî universalisation, the contact with everything (<em>horizontal gesture</em>) ‚Äî and it has been shown to the body in such a precise way, in the detail of the vibration.... In the state of receptivity (<em>vertical gesture to the Heights</em>), of receptive passivity (the opposite of action, that is), the body must be turned exclusively to the Supreme (<em>same vertical gesture</em>): the body and the cells have been taught that, and they've understood ‚Äî they've understood and are now used to it. In the state of action (<em>horizontal gesture</em>), when you are one with (well, let's limit the problem to the earth), one with the whole earth, there must be an ACTIVE radiating vibration of the supreme Force. Receptivity like this (<em>vertical gesture that receives the Force</em>), and activity like this (<em>horizontal gesture that</em></p>
<p class="p-num">Page 400</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3070"> spreads the Force out). And the cells have felt, they've understood, they can do it. And the relationship with everything around you, down to the smallest detail, is something so wonderful, with an influence radiating farther and farther away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3071">When you realize those two attitudes simultaneously, the contagion is abolished: the mental contagion (the one Sri Aurobindo refers to here, the one you get when you "admire" something), the mental contagion, the vital contagion, and EVEN THE PHYSICAL CONTAGION ‚Äî when the cells realize that, you stop catching illnesses. Because formerly (for a long time), whenever something occurred in the sphere of influence of the action, there used to be a repercussion (<em>in Mother</em>). For a very long time, it was dangerous. Then it became reduced to a sense of unease which would become conscious, and conscious of the why ‚Äî the why and the how. It was reduced to a state of unease, but it was still ... tiresome. And now it's a kind of ... I can't say "knowledge," because it's not mental, but an <em>awareness</em> (there's no word for it in French), a perception ‚Äî and nothing more, it doesn't have any action (<em>that is, any repercussion in Mother's body</em>). So then, the whole problem lies there:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3072">There are those who found this, the vertical ascent to the heights, and who isolated themselves from the world (they weren't able to do that completely because they didn't have the knowledge, but they tried). That's not the solution. Then there are those who want to help, the generous ones who are like this (<em>gesture of horizontal expansion</em>), and who catch everything, even the mental illnesses of all the people around them. The truth is the two together: this, the passive, receptive state (<em>vertical gesture</em>), and that, the active state of action and radiating influence (<em>horizontal gesture</em>). And the body has become wholly conscious of the dual movement and is working to realize it in detail.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3073">A great problem has been solved.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3074">And it's interesting because those two attitudes can be almost simultaneous, but they are ... From the standpoint of vibration, of vibratory sensation, they are two opposites that combine with each other: receptivity like this (<em>gesture</em>), towards the Consciousness, the Force, Power, Light, all, that comes from above, and naturally Love (but about Love I will speak later). And it comes (<em>gesture of descent</em>), it comes down and everything, everything is ab-so-lute-ly passive and receptive (<em>gesture of vertical opening</em>): it absorbs and absorbs and absorbs, like that, totally given, in the state of a sponge that absorbs and absorbs and absorbs.... At the same time, there is the relationship with the world (<em>horizontal gesture</em>) and the Power</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 401</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3075"> coming through and working, with the sense of the Force, the Action, the Thing imposing itself. It's magnificent. And in the SAME vibratory radiance of ... of "That." Always the same all-powerful Perfection being absorbed and acting (<em>gesture of flowing through Mother over the world in a perpetual movement</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3076">That seems to be the secret of all-powerfulness. There is no need at all to go through mental knowledge ‚Äî that diminishes, shrinks, hardens.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3077">It's an acute state of consciousness, that is, wholly awakened. In the cells of the body, it dispels all darkness. Naturally, it's a long and slow work, but it dispels, it's a state that dispels all darkness everywhere. And darkness is always the sign (sign or cause) of a disorder. We know there is still plenty of it. It's a slow work, a whole world! When you ... (how should I put it?) when you descend into (one can say descend or concentrate on) this cellular constitution of the body, on the body's scale, it's an innumerable world! An innumerable world. Everything is as though made up of innumerable tiny points, and each point has to be awakened and flooded with consciousness and light ‚Äî a long work.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3078" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3079">So it's the solution to these two errors that constantly contradict each other: the error of shrinking, of an exclusivism of influence (which, when practiced on the mental level, becomes a limitation, a pettiness, like all exclusive faiths); or else eclecticism without effect or force, which makes a sort of muddle of everything, of all ideas (mentally it doesn't matter, but on the level of the transformation, it's serious). So for these two opposites the problem has been solved.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3080">And the state I've just described is possible in the body's cells and in the corporeal consciousness, also in the psychic consciousness; but vitally and mentally, even if you understand, it seems like an almost impossible realization because of a fixity, a fixity in the form: the form of thoughts and the form of sensations. Mentally it could only be expressed as an acceptance of all thoughts, all formulae, raising them up towards ... something that's no longer a thought, no longer a mentally formulated thing, but a light, a conscious light that organises and unifies. But if you take them all on the same plane ... You can accept everything, but everything as one viewpoint ‚Äî one among innumerable viewpoints on "something" that cannot be expressed in words, because as soon as you put words on it, it becomes a formula, and the formula takes the power away. But physically, in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 402</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3081"> the body's cells, it's very, very clearly perceptible and is lived quite spontaneously: you receive only from on high, and you spread it.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3082">The only somewhat new thing is that the body is beginning to be a bit ... <em>restless</em> at its decay. Before, it was completely indifferent, it didn't give it a thought; it knew it was going on, but... Now, it's beginning to be troublesome. So perhaps it's a sign, I don't know? It's beginning to be troublesome ‚Äî not psychologically, but like this: when it receives the Command to do something and there is, not exactly an incapacity, but a limitation to the possibility, that starts it is unhappy. So I wondered ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3083">Then at night it's the same thing, it says, "Why such a so long period of diminishing consciousness?"</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3084"><em>Diminishing?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3085">You understand, it's only happy in what it regards as its normal state when it's fully conscious and vibrating with the Presence. But in the night's activities ... (how can I explain?) it's becomes more ... more like something one is used to, you know, like a habit (<em>gesture of a wave flowing</em>); there's no longer the joy of a vibrating observation, but a normal state of things, and it's not happy with that: it wants the same intensity (<em>vibrating gesture</em>) to be there at night. For instance, it doesn't tolerate the idea of fatigue, of the necessity of rest (although that never arises from the inconscient any more), but rest as a sort of turning in on oneself, like that, to repair wear and tear ‚Äî it doesn't like that: there must be no wear and tear, there must be a constant adaptation to anything asked of it. Later, it will probably not even accept effort ‚Äî there isn't much "effort" left, but instead of effort, there's a sort of conscious receptivity that enables it to do things; and there are constant examples to show that if this conscious receptivity isn't there, well, there's an awkwardness, or an impossibility, things like that, but it ... in the past, it used to feel that was unavoidable, but now it no longer wants it. Now it no longer wants it: it must not be like that. For example, to tidy up, or find something or do something, it sometimes feels a sense of difficulty (it's never quite impossible</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 403</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3086"> because nothing is asked of it which is impossible), but at times it's difficult ‚Äî it starts being displeased. It feels that as an infirmity, or a lack of receptivity, you understand. Also the fact that it has become stooped: in the past it would say, "It'll get better"; now it's beginning to lose patience. That's quite new. It is since November 24. Because it's not a selfish turning in on itself, it's not that, it's not for itself, it's ... the sense of a lack of receptivity to the Force, of limitation arising from incapacity ‚Äî it doesn't like that anymore.</p>

Inside it's all white, nothing moving. And then, I don't even make an effort to bring something down, nothing: "It's not my business." If I am asked, I answer, "Nothing, I have nothing to say." Or else, something goes like this immediately (<em>gesture on the alert, wide awake</em>), stands up and remains attentive, and after one minute, two minutes, ten minutes (I don't know), suddenly, plop! down it drops. Then I write it. And as it falls, it gathers words and makes its sentence. Sometimes it's in French, sometimes in English ‚Äî it depends mostly on the person it's intended for, but it also depends on the subject. So then, if (that's why I keep pieces of paper and pencils everywhere), if I have my piece of paper and pencil, I write it down and it's over; if I don't write it, if I say, "Oh well, I'll note it down a little later," then it keeps coming and coming and coming back every second ... until it's written down.

Wouldn't this be a better way to put it? Is it exactly the way it should be?" And also, "Are you sure there aren't any spelling mistakes, have you written it properly?" Like that. What a nuisance! So sometimes I say to it, "Leave me in peace!" (not even as politely as that). Sometimes I give the piece of paper, then take it back and say, "Let me see" ‚Äî until it's satisfied. Sometimes a word isn't quite correctly written, then it says, "Ah! See, see, you've made a mistake there." Sometimes there are spelling mistakes: "See, see, you've made a mistake!"</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3131">There is obviously a will to abolish the sense of time, because ... It's very interesting, there are all kinds of experiences like that. I have work that would normally take thirty-six hours out of twenty-four, so naturally, I get later and later every day: I go to bed later and later, and I have to do the night's work, so sometimes I am late in the morning, at times I've been as much as one hour late. Then in the morning, with a certain concentration, in half an hour I do what would normally take me an hour. I have learned a lot in that respect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3132">Now, at this time (<em>10:45 A.M.</em>), I can see that the only fatigue is the sense of being late, otherwise one can work indefinitely. There is something to be learned. I mention it to you because it's just occurred to me: it occurs to me that the purpose is to find the key to the mastery over time; not to be regular, but to do everything over a more or less longer or shorter time, in a contracted or expanded time ‚Äî so time loses its concrete reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3133">For me it would be very easy. The difficulty is all the people, all those around me, whose life (<em>laughing</em>) is like this (<em>chaotic gesture</em>), without meaning. It looks incoherent. I can't tell someone, "I'll see you at such and such time," because that's not true! I don't know at what time I'll see him. And so, as people are used to eating, sleeping, working at regular hours and all that is regulated, it causes a dreadful confusion ‚Äî but what's to be done?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3134">It's not easy. When you are alone, it doesn't matter, but when you are with many, many people, it's very difficult.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3135">There is the sense of the elasticity of time, which is to say that it has no concrete reality; what gives it a concrete reality is human organization.... That would leave only the sun, but for the moment it's not a big disturbance because what I do doesn't need daylight; you can rest at any time and work at any time, but a life organized such as it is...? I don't know.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3136">Something has to be found.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3149">So to the superficial mind ... On our part, we know it's true because, as Sri Aurobindo said, the Truth has to be truly established</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 410</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3150"> and to reign for Divine Love to be able to manifest in all its power and glory without ... without demolishing everything. Sri Aurobindo put it even more strongly, he said it would "destroy" everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3151">So that's the message I am going to give.</p>
<p class="Ps">*<br/> *¬†¬† *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3152"><em>Then Mother reverts to the beginning of the conversation:</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3153">Oh, the correspondence has become something fantastic! Twenty-four, twenty-six, thirty, sometimes forty letters a day. So naturally, try as I may ... When it's just a line, it's all right, but I can barely reply to eight or ten a day: I have only an hour and a half, that's not much ‚Äî not even that much! No, no, the "hour" is too much: I have half an hour! But I extend it: I have from 7 to 7:30 in the evening, but every day I extend it till 8. Dinner is supposedly at 7: 30, I take it at 8. Supposedly too, I go to bed at 9:30 and get up at 4:30, but when I went to bed last night it was almost 11 ‚Äî 10:30 is frequent, which means an hour late. So from time to time I get up late. You understand, between about 1 and 2 A.M. (around 12:30, 1, or 2), I complete the first stage of concentration to give the body a good rest; after that I start working, and before working, a little concentration so that whatever the work, I should be back at 4:30; but sometimes it's later sometimes it's 4:45. Then, afterwards, I have a certain time in the morning for washing and dressing, and that's when there have been really interesting experiences: with a certain concentration (which has nothing to do with willpower or anything of the kind: it's a concentration, a certain type of concentration and making contact with the Presence ‚Äî and the sense of the relativity, the very considerable relativity of material time), with an intensity of concentration, you can do the same thing much faster. I eventually found out that simply by concentration you can reduce the time by more than half. And you do things in exactly the same way, but they don't take time ‚Äî how?... Well, the secrets haven't been revealed yet. But the phenomenon exists.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3154">The same principle is at work (it's not a "principle," it's a way of doing or a way of being), is at work for all things: with fatigue, the onset of illness, that is, the cause of the illness (the internal disorder or the receptivity to the disorder from outside), it works also in the same way. If you add to it the intensity of faith or adoration, then it's much easier, but it works in the same way. So what exactly takes</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 411</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3155"> place? To the inner perception, the perception of the consciousness, it is a sort of principle of disorder ‚Äî a principle, almost a taste for disorder, I don't know, it's between a habit and a preference for disorder ‚Äî which gets replaced by ... yes (to be as general as possible), by a vibration of harmony. But that vibration of harmony is full of light, of sweetness, of ... warmth, intensity, and so wonderfully CALM! So when "that" takes the place of the other, then all that belongs to the world of disorder is dissolved. AND the rigidity of time disappears.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="148" href="#">2</a> Time ... perhaps we could say (it's just a way of speaking), we could say that time is replaced by a succession ... (<em>Mother remains absorbed for a long time</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3156">And that belongs specifically to the material world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3157">I take the simplest and most concrete things like, for instance, brushing one's teeth; it's extremely flexible and things are done, not out of habit but by a sort of choice based on personal experience and routine, so there is no necessity for a special concentration (the real purpose of routine is to avoid the need for a special concentration: things can be done almost automatically). But that automatism is very flexible, very plastic, because depending, as I said, on the intensity of the concentration, the time varies ‚Äî the time varies: you can (you can know by looking at your watch before and after), you can certainly reduce the time by more than half, yet things are done in exactly the same way. That's right: you don't do away with anything, you do everything in the same way. To make sure, you can, for instance, count the number of times you brush your teeth or the number of times you rinse your mouth ‚Äî I am DELIBERATELY taking the most banal thing, because in other activities there is a natural suppleness that allows you to spread yourself and concentrate (and so it's easier to understand with such things). But it works in the same way with the most concrete and banal things too. And there isn't any "Oh, I won't do this today" or "I am neglecting that" ‚Äî there's none of that, nothing at all: everything is done in the same way, BUT with a sort of concentration and constant call ‚Äî the constant call is always there. The constant call which might find a material expression in saying the mantra, but it's not even that: it's the SENSE, the sense of the call, of the aspiration ‚Äî it's above all a call. A call. You know, when the mind wants to make sentences, it says, "Lord, take possession of Your kingdom." For certain things, I remember, when there are certain disorders, something wrong (and with the perception of a consciousness that has become very sharp, you can see</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 412</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3158"> when that disorder is the natural origin of an illness, for example, or of something very serious), with the call, the concentration and the response ... [the disorder is dissolved]. It's almost a surrender, because it's an uncalculating self-giving: the damaged spot opens to the Influence, not with an idea of getting cured, but like this (<em>gesture like a flower opening out</em>), simply like this, unconditionally ‚Äî that is the most potent gesture.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3159">But the interesting part is that formulating it in words makes it sound artificial ‚Äî it's much more sincere, much truer, much more spontaneous than anything expressed or expressible by the mind. No formula can render the sincerity ‚Äî simplicity, sincerity, spontaneity, something uncalculating ‚Äî of the material movement. There was a time when expressing or formulating caused a very unpleasant sensation, like putting something artificial on something spontaneously true; and that unpleasantness was cured only, to begin with, by a higher knowledge that all that is formulated must be surpassed. For instance, every experience expressed or described CALLS FOR a new progress, a new experience. In other words, it hastens the movement. That has been a consolation, because in fact, with the old sensation of something very stable and solid and immobile because of inertia (a past inertia, which is now being transformed but has left marks), because of that inertia there is a tendency to prefer things to be solid; so there is a thrill at being forced to ... "No, no! No rest, no halt, go on!" ‚Äî farther and farther and farther on ... When an experience has been very fruitful and highly pleasant, let us say, when it's had a great force and a great effect, the first movement is to say, "We won't talk about that, we'll keep it." Then after comes, "We'll say it in order to go farther on" ‚Äî to go farther on, ever farther, ever farther....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3160">There is a stability in the resolve and in the aspiration, a stability that can be found nowhere as much as here (<em>Mother strikes the ground</em>). That's a characteristic of Matter. And you know, when it has given itself and has faith, it becomes so stable, so constant, and ... the joy, that sort of widening, of luminous expansion ‚Äî it becomes such a perpetual need that in no other part of the being has it ever been like that. It's something ESTABLISHED. And established effortlessly, established spontaneously, naturally, normally. So we can foresee that when this Matter will become truly divine ‚Äî truly divine ‚Äî its manifestation will be infinitely more complete, more perfect in the details, and more stable than anywhere else.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3161">I've noticed that if you ask an Englishman today, they are much more supple than those who learned English in Victorian times, which was a much more rigid English.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3162">Generally I only have to listen, and Sri Aurobindo speaks to me.... Sri Aurobindo's English was very supple; purists used to argue over certain formulations, and I remember, about certain criticisms he would tell me, "But that's because they don't understand! If I put it this way, it means one thing, and if I put it that way, it means something else. And if I move one word to another place in my sentence, it changes the meaning." He was very exact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3163">If you take little words like this one (<em>Mother hesitated between "collaborate to the triumph of the Truth" and "collaborate for"</em>), there is a subtle difference in meaning whether you use one or the other. And the classic formula generally gives the more banal meaning, the more ordinary, the more superficial.</p>

The man who questioned him was entirely convinced of it because he's a boy who can't do such things, and he said, "I totally disapprove of that." But the police reports had said that he was involved.

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3189">(<em>Laughing</em>) All this hangs together in a marvellous balance!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3190" style="text-align: right;">(<em>Satprem reads out the note</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3191"><em>"Auroville will be a self-supporting township.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3192"><em>"All who live there will participate in its life and development.</em></p>

<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3196"><em>"No rules or laws are being framed. Things will get formulated as the underlying Truth of the township emerges and takes shape progressively. We do not anticipate."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3197">Is that all?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3198">I thought I had said more than that. Because inwardly I said a great deal, a great deal about the organization of food and so on.... We are going to try things out.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3199">Some things are really interesting. For instance, I'd like there to be ... To begin with, every country will have its pavilion, and in the pavilion, there will be the cuisine of that country, which means that the Japanese will be able to eat Japanese food if they want to(!), etc., but in the township itself, there will be food for vegetarians, food for nonvegetarians, and also a sort of experiment to find "tomorrow's food." You see, all this work of assimilation which makes you so heavy (it takes up so much time and energy from the being) should be done BEFORE, you should be able to immediately assimilate what you are given, as with things they make now; for instance, they have those vitamins that can be directly assimilated, and also (what do they call it? ... (<em>Mother tries to remember</em>) I take them every day.... Words and I aren't on very good terms!) ... proteins. Nutritive principles that are found in one thing or another and aren't bulky ‚Äî you need to take a tremendous quantity of food to assimilate very little. So now that they are fairly clever with chemicals, that could be simplified. People don't like it, simply because ... they take an intense pleasure in eating(!), but when you no longer take pleasure in eating,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 418</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3200"> you need to be nourished and not to waste your time with that. The amount of time lost is enormous: time for eating, time for digesting, and the rest. So I would like to have an experimental kitchen there, a sort of "culinary laboratory," to try out. And according to their tastes and tendencies, people would go here or there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3201">And you don't pay for your food, but you must give your work, or the ingredients: for example, those who had fields would give the produce of their fields; those who had factories would give their products; or else your own work in exchange for food.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3202">That alone does away with much of the internal circulation of money.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3203">And in every field things of that sort could be found.... Basically, it would be a town for studies ‚Äî studies and research on how to live in a simplified way, and where the higher qualities have MORE TIME to develop. There.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3204">It's only a small beginning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3205" style="text-align: right;">(<em>Then Mother goes over the text of the note, sentence by sentence</em>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3206"><em>"Auroville will be a self-supporting township."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3207">I want to insist on the fact that it will be an experiment: it's to make experiments ‚Äî experiments, research, studies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3208"><em>An experimental city?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3209">Yes ... Auroville will be a city that will attempt to be, or strive or want to be, <em>self-supporting</em>, that is ...</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3210"><em>Autonomous?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3211">"Autonomous" is understood as a sort of independence that breaks off relations with the outside, and that's not what I mean.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3212">For example, those who produce food, a factory such as "Aurofood" (naturally, when we will be fifty thousand, it will be difficult to meet the needs, but for the moment we'll only be a few thousand at the most), well, a factory always produces far too much.... So it will sell outside and receive money. And "Aurofood," for instance, wants to have a special relationship with workers, not at all the old system ‚Äî something that would be an improvement on the Communist system, a more balanced organization than Sovietism or</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 419</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3213"> Communism, that is, which doesn't lean too much either toward one side or the other.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3214">The idea of "Aurofood" is good, and they are trying to make propaganda among industrialists.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3215">And there is one thing I wanted to say. The participation in the welfare and existence of the whole township isn't something worked out individually: such individual must give so much. It's not like that. It's worked out according to one's means, activity, possibilities of production; it's not the democratic idea, which cuts everything into small equal bits ‚Äî an absurd machinery. It's worked out according to one's means: one who has much gives much, one who has little gives little; one who is strong works a lot, one who isn't strong does something else. You understand, it's something truer, deeper. And that's why I am not trying to explain it right away, because people will start making all kinds of protests. It must come into being AUTOMATICALLY, so to say, with the growth of the township, in the true spirit. That's why this note is quite succinct.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3216">This sentence, for instance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3217"><em>"All who live there will participate in its life and development ..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3218">... according to their capacities and means, not a mechanical "so much per unit." That's the point. It must be something living and TRUE, not mechanical. And "according to their capacities," that is, one who has material means such as those a factory gives will have to provide in proportion to his production ‚Äî not so much per individual or per head.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3219"><em>"This participation may be passive or active."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3220">I don't understand what they mean by "passive" (because I spoke in French, then they put it into English). What can they mean by "passive"?... It would be rather on different planes or levels of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3221"><em>You meant that those who basically are sages, who work within, won't have to ...</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3222">Yes, that's right. Those who have a higher knowledge won't have to work with their hands, that's what I mean.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 420</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3223"><em>"There will be no taxes as such but each will contribute to the collective welfare in work, kind or money."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3224">So that's understood: there will be no taxes of any kind, but everyone will have to contribute to the collective welfare through his work, in kind or with money. Those who have nothing other than money will give money. But to tell the truth, the "work" may be an inner work (but that can't be said, because people aren't honest enough). The work may be an occult work, a completely inner work, but of course, for that to be, it must be absolutely sincere and true, and with the capacity: no pretence. But it's not necessarily a material work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3225"><em>"Sections like Industries which participate actively will contribute part of their income towards the development of the township. Or if they produce something (like foodstuff) useful for the citizens, they will contribute in kind to the township which is responsible for the feeding of the citizens."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3226">That's what we've said. The industries will participate actively, they will contribute. If they are industries producing articles that aren't in constant need ‚Äî and are therefore in quantities or numbers too great for the township's own use that will be sold outside ‚Äî those industries must naturally participate through money. And I take the example of food: those who produce food will give the township what it needs (in proportion to what they produce, naturally), and it is the township's responsibility to feed everyone. That means people won't have to buy their food with money, but they will have to earn it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3227">It's a kind of adaptation of the Communist system, but not in a spirit of levelling: according to everyone's capacity, his position (not a psychological or intellectual one), his INNER position.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3228"><em>In democracies and with the Communists, there's a levelling down: everyone is pulled down to the same level.</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3229">Yes, that's just the point.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3230">The true part is that every human being has the right ... (but it's not a "right" ...). The organization must be such, must be arranged in such a way, that everyone's material needs should be guaranteed, not according to notions of right and equality, but on the basis of the most elementary necessities; then, once that is established, everyone must be free to organize his life, not according to his monetary</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 421</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3231"> means, but according to his inner capacities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3232"><em>"No rules or laws are being framed. Things will get formulated as the underlying Truth of the township emerges and takes shape progressively. We do not anticipate."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3233">What I mean is that usually (always till now, and more and more so), men establish mental rules according to their conceptions and their ideal, then they apply them (<em>Mother lowers her fist, as if to show the world under the mental grip</em>). And that's absolutely false, arbitrary, unreal, with the result that things revolt, or else waste away and disappear.... It's the experience of LIFE ITSELF that must slowly work out rules AS SUPPLE AND VAST as possible, in order that they remain ever progressive. Nothing must be fixed. That's the immense error of governments: they build a framework and say, "Here is what we've established, now we must live under it." So naturally, Life is crushed and prevented from progressing. It is Life itself, developing more and more in a progression towards Light, Knowledge, Power, that must progressively establish rules as general as possible, so as to be extremely supple and capable of changing according to need ‚Äî of changing AS RAPIDLY as habits and needs do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3234" style="text-align: right;">(<em>silence</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3235">At bottom, the problem almost boils down to this: to replace the mental government of intelligence by the government of a spiritualized consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3236">It's an extremely interesting experience: how the same actions, the same work, the same observations, the same relationship with the people around (near or far), how they take place in the mind, through intelligence, and how they take place in the consciousness, by experience. And that's what this body is now learning ‚Äî to replace the mental government of intelligence by the spiritual government of the consciousness. And it makes (it looks like nothing, one may not notice it), it makes a tremendous difference, to the point of multiplying the body's possibilities a hundredfold.... When the body is subjected to rules, even if they are broad, even if they are comprehensive, it is a slave to those rules and its possibilities are limited by them. But when it's governed by the Spirit and the Consciousness that gives it an incomparable possibility and flexibility! And that's what will give it the capacity to prolong its life, to last longer: it's by</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 422</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3237"> replacing the mental, intellectual government by the government of the Spirit, of the Consciousness ‚Äî THE Consciousness. Outwardly, it doesn't seem to make much difference, but... My experience is like this (because now my body no longer obeys the mind or the intelligence at all, not any more ‚Äî it doesn't even understand how that can be done), and more and more, and better and better, it follows the direction and impulsion of the Consciousness. But then, it sees, almost at each minute, the tremendous difference that it makes.... For instance, time has lost its value (its rigid value): you can do exactly the same thing in very little time or in much time. Necessities have lost their authority: you can adapt yourself this way, adapt yourself that way. All the laws ‚Äî those laws that were laws of Nature ‚Äî have lost all their despotism, we may say: it no longer works that way. All you have to do is always, always be supple, attentive, and... responsive (if any such thing can be!) to the influence of the Consciousness ‚Äî the Consciousness in its all-powerfulness ‚Äî so as to go through all this with extraordinary suppleness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3238">That is the discovery being made more and more.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3239">And it's wonderful, you know! A wonderful discovery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3240">It's like a progressive victory over all constraints. So naturally, all the laws of Nature, all the human laws, all habits, all rules, they all become increasingly supple and finally nonexistent. Yet it is possible to keep a regular rhythm that facilitates action ‚Äî it's not contrary to this suppleness. But it's a suppleness in the execution, in the adaptation, which comes and changes everything. From the point of view of hygiene, health, organization, from the point of view of relationships with others, all that has not only lost its aggressiveness (because for that, it suffices to be wise ‚Äî wise and level-headed and calm), but also its absolutism, its imperative rule: that's completely gone ‚Äî gone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3241">And then you see: as the process grows more and more perfect ‚Äî "perfect" means integral, total, leaving nothing behind ‚Äî it NECESSARILY, inevitably means victory over death. Not that this dissolution of the cells which death represents stops existing, but it would exist only when necessary: not as an absolute law, but as ONE of the processes, when necessary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3242">It's mainly that: all that the Mind has brought in terms of rigidity and absoluteness and near invincibility ‚Äî that's what ... is going to disappear. And simply by ... handing the supreme power over to the Supreme Consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3243">That may be what the sages of old meant when they spoke of handing the power of Nature or the power of the <em>Prakriti</em> over to the</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 423</p>
<p class="P" search_id="MAV8-3244"> <em>Purusha</em> ‚Äî handing it from the Prakriti over to the Purusha. Perhaps it was their way of expressing the same thing.</p>
