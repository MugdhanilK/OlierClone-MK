<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="publishers-note">Publisher’s Note</h1>
<p class="Pi"><em>Collected Poems</em> comprises all of Sri Aurobindo’s
		poetical works with the exception of (1) the epic <em>Savitri</em>, (2) poetic
		dramas, (3) most translations into verse of poetry in Sanskrit, Bengali and
		other languages, and (4) original poetry in Bengali and Sanskrit. <em>Savitri</em>
		is published as volumes 33 and 34 of <span class="D_NAME_1">The Complete Works
			of Sri Aurobindo</span>; the poetic dramas are included in volumes 3 and 4, <em>
			Collected Plays and Stories</em>; the poetic translations are included in volume
		5, <em>Translations</em>; and the original poetry in Sanskrit and Bengali is
		published in volume 9, <em>Writings in Bengali and Sanskrit</em>.</p>
<p class="Pi">The present volume includes all short and narrative
		poems in English that Sri Aurobindo published during his lifetime. It also
		includes all complete poems found among his manuscripts after his passing, as
		well as incomplete poetry that the editors thought worthy of inclusion.</p>
<p class="Pi">The poems have been arranged in seven overlapping
		chronological parts, which are subdivided into sections representing different
		genres and states of completeness. Poems published in small books during Sri
		Aurobindo’s lifetime have, for the most part, been kept together as published.</p>
<p class="Pi">Sri Aurobindo worked on the poems in this volume over
		the course of seven decades. The first one was published in 1883, when he was
		ten. A number were composed or revised more than sixty years later, during the
		late 1940s.</p>

		Turned worldwards, through illimitable space<br/>
		Had travelled like a star ’twixt earth and heaven<br/>
		Slowly and brightly.
		Late our mortal air<br/>
		He breathed; for downward now the hooves divine<br/>
		Trampling out fire with sound before them went,<br/>
		And the great earth rushed up towards him, green.<br/>
		With the first line of dawn he touched the peaks,<br/>
		Nor paused upon those savage heights, but reached<br/>
		Inferior summits subject to the rain,<br/>
		And rested.
		Looking northwards thence he saw<br/>
		The giant snows upclimbing to the sky,<br/>
		And felt the mighty silence.
		In his ear<br/>
		The noise of a retreating battle was,<br/>
		Wide crash of wheels and hard impetuous blare<br/>
		Of trumpets and the sullen march of hosts.<br/>
		Therefore with joy he drank into his soul<br/>
		The virgin silence inaccessible<br/>
		Of mountains and divined his mother’s breasts.<br/>
		But as he listened to the hush, a thought<br/>
		Came to him from the spring and he turned round<br/>
		And gazed into the quiet maiden East,<br/>
		Watching that birth of day, as if a line<br/>
		Of some great poem out of dimness grew,<br/>
		Slowly unfolding into perfect speech.<br/>
		The grey lucidity and pearliness<br/>
		Bloomed more and more, and over earth chaste again<br/>
		The freshness of the primal dawn returned,<br/>
		Life coming with a virginal sharp strength,<br/>
		Renewed as from the streams of Paradise.<br/>
		Nearer it drew now to him and he saw<br/>
		Out of the widening glory move a face<br/>
		Of dawn, a body fresh from mystery,<br/>
		Enveloped with a prophecy of light<br/>
		More rich than perfect splendours.
		It was she,</p>

		Stirring her hair and all about her gold.<br/>
		Nor sole she came.
		Behind her faces laughed<br/>
		Delicious, girls of heaven whose beauties ease<br/>
		The labour of the battle-weary Gods;<br/>
		They in the golden dawn of things sprang gold,<br/>
		From youth of the immortal Ocean born,<br/>
		They youthful and immortal, and the waves<br/>
		Were in their feet and in their voices fresh<br/>
		As foam, and Ocean in their souls was love.<br/>
		Laughing they ran among the clouds, their hair<br/>
		And raiment all a tempest in the breeze.<br/>
		The sky grew glorious with them and their feet<br/>
		A restless loveliness and glad eyes full<br/>
		Of morning and divine faces bent back<br/>

		Moved like the sea – when with a coming wind<br/>
		Great Ocean lifts in far expectancy<br/>
		Waiting to feel the shock, so was he moved<br/>
		By expectation of her face.
		For this<br/>
		Was secret in its own divinity<br/>
		Like a high sun of splendour, or half seen<br/>
		All troubled with her hair.
		Yet Paradise<br/>
		Breathed from her limbs and tresses wonderful,<br/>
		With odours and with dreams.

		In moonlight and in starlight and in fire?<br/>
		Some flower whose brightness was a trouble? a face<br/>
		Whose memory like a picture lived with me?<br/>
		A thought I had, but lost?
		O was thy voice<br/>
		A vernal repetition in some grove,<br/>
		Telling of lilies clustered o’er with bees<br/>
		And quiet waters open to the moon?<br/>
		Surely in some past life I loved thy name,<br/>
		And syllable by syllable now strive<br/>
		Its sweetness to recall.
		It seems the grace<br/>
		Of visible things, of hushed and lonely snows<br/>
		And burning great inexorable noons,<br/>
		And towns and valleys and the mountain winds.<br/>
		All beauty of earthliness is in thee, all<br/>

		Long strives in vain and rolls his painful thought<br/>
		Through many alien ways, when sudden comes<br/>
		A flash, another, and the vision burns<br/>
		Like lightning in the brain, so leaped that name<br/>
		Into the musing of the troubled king.<br/>
		Joyous he cried aloud and lashed his steeds:<br/>
		They, rearing, leaped from Himalaya high<br/>
		And trampled with their hooves the southern wind.<br/>
		But now a cry broke from the lovely crowd<br/>
		Of fear and tremulous astonishment;<br/>
		And they huddled together like doves dismayed<br/>
		Who see the inevitable talons near<br/>
		And rush of cruel wings.
		’Twas not from him,<br/>
		For him they saw not yet, but from the north<br/>
		A fear was on them, and Pururavus<br/>
		Heard a low roar as of a distant cloud.<br/>
		He turned half-wrathful.
		In the far northwest<br/>
		Heaven stood thick, concentrated in gloom,<br/>

		Then bright Tilôttama<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="41" href="#">18</a><br/>
		Cried in a shining glory over them:<br/>
		“O happy lover and O fortunate loved,<br/>
		Who make love heavenlier by loss!
		Ah yet,<br/>
		The Gods give no irrecoverable gifts,<br/>
		Nor unconditioned, O Pururavus,<br/>
		Is highest bliss even to most favoured men.<br/>
		And thy deep joy must tremble o’er her with soul<br/>
		On guard, all overshadowed by a fear.<br/>
		For one year thou shalt know her on the peaks,<br/>
		In solitary vastnesses of hills<br/>
		And regions snow-besieged; and for one year<br/>
		In the green forests populous and free<br/>
		Life in sunlight and by delightful streams<br/>
		Thou shalt enjoy her; and for one year where<br/>
		The busy tramp of men goes ceaseless by,<br/>
		Subduing her to lovely human cares:<br/>
		And so long after as one law observed<br/>
		Save her to thee, O King; for never man<br/>
		With Opsara may dwell and both be known:<br/>
		Either a rapture she invisible<br/>
		Or he a mystic body and mystic soul.<br/>
		Reveal not then thy being naked to hers,<br/>
		O virgin Ila’s son, nor suffer ever<br/>
		Light round thy body naked to her eyes,<br/>
		Lest day dawn not on thy felicity,<br/>
		Sole among men.”
		She left them, shining up<br/>
		Into the sunlight, and was lost in noon.<br/>
		And King Pururavus stood for a space,<br/>
		Like the entrancèd calm before great winds<br/>
		And thunder.
		Then through all his limbs there flashed</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-135">Youth and the beauty and the warmth of earth<br/>
		And joy of her left lonely to his will.<br/>

		She, a leaf<br/>
		Before a gust among the nearing trees,<br/>
		Cowered.
		But, all a sea of mighty joy<br/>
		Rushing and swallowing up the golden sand,<br/>
		With a great cry and glad Pururavus<br/>
		Seized her and caught her to his bosom thrilled,<br/>
		Clinging and shuddering.
		All her wonderful hair<br/>
		Loosened and the wind seized and bore it streaming<br/>
		Over the shoulder of Pururavus<br/>
		And on his cheek a softness.
		She, o’erborne,<br/>
		Panting, with inarticulate murmurs lay,<br/>
		Like a slim tree half seen through driving hail,<br/>
		Her naked arms clasping his neck, her cheek<br/>
		And golden throat averted, and wide trouble<br/>
		In her large eyes bewildered with their bliss.<br/>
		Amid her wind-blown hair their faces met.<br/>
		With her sweet limbs all his, feeling her breasts<br/>
		Tumultuous up against his beating heart,<br/>
		He kissed the glorious mouth of heaven’s desire.<br/>
		So clung they as two shipwrecked in a surge.<br/>
		Then strong Pururavus, with godlike eyes<br/>
		Mastering hers, cried tremulous: “O beloved,<br/>
		O miser of thy rich and happy voice,<br/>
		One word, one word to tell me that thou lovest.”<br/>
		And Urvasie, all broken on his bosom,<br/>
		Her godhead in his passion lost, moaned out<br/>
		From her imprisoned breasts, “My lord, my love!”</p>

		For over them victorious Love still showered<br/>
		His arrows marble-dinting, not flower-tipped</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 92</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-141">As our brief fading fires,– naked and large<br/>

		To Urvasie, were near; they were ever<br/>
		With her and cherished; hardly even she loved<br/>
		The tender faces of her children more<br/>
		Than these choice from flocks heavenly: only these<br/>

		So lay they under those fierce shafts of Love,<br/>

		Once more, if never once again on earth.<br/>
		Before he slept, the lord of Urvasie<br/>

		But the night darkened over the vague town,<br/>
		And clouds came gradual up, and through the clouds<br/>
		In thunderless great flashes stealing came<br/>
		The subtle-souled Gundhurvas from the peaks<br/>
		Of distant Paradise.
		Thunder rolled out,<br/>
		And through the walls, in a fierce rush of light,<br/>
		Entered the thieves of heaven and stole the rams,<br/>

		And starting from his sleep Pururavus,<br/>
		In that waking when memory is far<br/>
		And nature of a man unquestioned rules,<br/>
		Heard of oppression and a space forgot<br/>
		Fate and his weak tenure of mighty bliss,<br/>
		Restored to the great nature of a king.<br/>
		Wrathful he leaped up and on one swift stride<br/>
		Reached to his bow.
		Before ’twas grasped he shuddered,<br/>
		His soul all smitten with a rushing fear.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 93</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-142">Alarmed he turned towards her.
		Suddenly wide<br/>
		The whole room stood in splendour manifest,<br/>
		All lightning, and heroically vast,<br/>
		In gesture kingly like a statue stayed,<br/>
		Rose glorious, all a grace of naked limbs,<br/>
		The hero beautiful, Pururavus,<br/>
		In that fierce light.
		Intenser than by day<br/>
		He for one brilliant moment clear beheld<br/>
		All the familiar place, the fretted huge<br/>
		Images on the columns, the high-reared<br/>
		Walls massively erect and silent floor,<br/>
		And on the floor the gracious fallen dress<br/>
		That never should embrace her perfect form,<br/>
		Lying a glimmer, and each noble curve<br/>
		Of the strong couch, and delicately distinct<br/>
		The golden body and the flower-like face:<br/>
		Beside her with a lovely smile that other,<br/>
		One small hand pressing back the shining curls<br/>
		Blown with her speed over her.
		Then all faded.<br/>
		Thunder crashed through the heavens jubilant.<br/>
		For a long while he stood with beating heart<br/>
		Half-conscious of its loss, and as if waiting<br/>
		Another flash, into the dimness gazed<br/>
		For those loved outlines that were far away.<br/>
		Then with a quiet smile he went and placed<br/>
		Where she had lain such a short while ago<br/>
		Both hands, expecting her sweet breasts, but found<br/>
		Her place all empty to him.
		Silently<br/>
		He lay down whispering to his own heart:<br/>
		“She has arisen and her shining dress<br/>
		Put round her and gone into the cool alcove<br/>
		To fetch sweet water for the heavenly rams,<br/>
		And she will stay awhile perhaps to look<br/>
		And muse upon the night, and then come back,<br/>
		And give them drink, and silently lie down<br/>
		Beside me.
		I shall see her when it dawns.”<br/>
		And so he slept.
		But the grey dawn came in</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 94</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-143">And raised his lashes.
		He stretched out his arms<br/>
		To find her.
		Then he knew he was alone.</p><br/>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-144">Even so he would not dwell with his despair.<br/>
		“She is but gone,” he said, “for a little gone<br/>
		Into the infinite silences afar<br/>
		To see her golden sisters and revisit<br/>
		The streams she knew and those unearthly skies.<br/>
		But she will soon come back,– even if her heart<br/>
		Would let her linger, mine would draw her back; –<br/>
		Come soon and talk to me of all she left,<br/>
		And clasp her children, and resume sweet goings<br/>
		And happy daily tasks and rooms she loved.”<br/>
		So, steadfast, he continued kingly toils<br/>
		Among a people greatly-destined, giving<br/>
		In sacred sessions and assemblies calm<br/>
		Counsels far-seeing, magnanimous decrees<br/>
		Bronze against Time, and from the judgment seat<br/>
		Unblamed sentence or reconcilement large.<br/>
		And perfect trinity of holy fires<br/>
		He kindled for desirable rain, and went<br/>
		To concourse of strong men or pleasant crowds,<br/>
		Or triumphed in great games armipotent.<br/>
		Yet behind all his moments there was void.<br/>
		And as when one puts from him desperately<br/>
		The thought of an inevitable fate,<br/>
		Blinding himself with present pleasures, often<br/>
		At a slight sound, a knocking at the door,<br/>
		A chance word terrible, or even uncalled<br/>
		His heart grows sick with sudden fear, and ghastly<br/>
		The face of that dread future through the window<br/>
		Looks at him; mute he sits then shuddering:<br/>
		So to Pururavus in session holy,<br/>
		Or warlike concourse, or alone, speaking,<br/>
		Or sitting, often a swift dreadful fear<br/>
		Made his life naked like a lightning flash;<br/>
		Then his whole being shook and his strong frame,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 95</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-145">As with a fever, and his eyes gazed blind;<br/>
		Soon with great breaths he repossessed his soul.<br/>
		Long he endured thus, but when shocks of fear<br/>
		And brilliant passage of remorseless suns<br/>
		And wakeful nights wrestling with memory<br/>
		Invisibly had worn his heart, he then<br/>
		Going as one desperate, void of thought or aim,<br/>
		Into that silent place dim with the west,<br/>
		Saw there her dress empty of her, and bed<br/>
		Forlorn, and the cold floor where she had lain<br/>
		At noon and made life sweet to him with her voice.<br/>
		Sometimes as in an upland reservoir<br/>
		Built by the hands of early Aryan kings,<br/>
		Its banks in secret fretted long go down,<br/>
		Suddenly down with resonant collapse,<br/>
		Then with a formidable sound the flood<br/>
		Descends, heard over all the echoing hills,<br/>
		And marble cities are o’erwhelmed; so sank<br/>
		The courage of the strong Pururavus,<br/>
		By memory and anguish overcome<br/>
		And thoughts of bliss intolerable.
		Tears<br/>
		Came from him; the unvanquished hero lay<br/>
		With outstretched arms and wept.
		Henceforth his life<br/>
		Was with that room.
		If he appeared in high<br/>
		Session, warlike concourse or pleasant crowd,<br/>
		Men looked on him as on the silent dead.<br/>
		Nor did he linger, but from little stay<br/>
		Would silently return and in hushed rooms<br/>
		Watch with the little relics left of her,<br/>
		Things he had hardly borne to see before,<br/>
		Now clasped them often, often kissed, sometimes<br/>
		Spoke to them as to sweet and living friends,<br/>
		And often over his sleeping children hung.<br/>
		Nor did he count the days, nor weep again,<br/>
		But looked into the dawn with tearless eyes.<br/>
		And all the people mourned for their great king,<br/>
		Silently watching him, and many murmured:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 96</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-146">“This is not he, the King Pururavus,<br/>
		Hero august, who his impetuous soul<br/>
		Ruled like a calm and skilful charioteer,<br/>
		And was the virgin Ila’s son, our king.<br/>
		Would that the enemy’s war-cry now might rush<br/>
		Against our gates and all the air be sound.<br/>
		Surely he would arise and lift his bow,<br/>
		And his swift chariot hurling through the gates<br/>
		Advance upon them like a sea, and triumph,<br/>
		And be himself among the rushing wheels.”<br/>
		So they would murmur grieving.
		But the king<br/>
		When the bright months brought round a lustier earth,<br/>
		Felt over his numbed soul some touch of flowers,<br/>
		And rose a little from his grief, and lifted<br/>
		His eyes against the stars.
		Then he said low:<br/>
		“I was not wont so quickly to despair.<br/>
		O hast thou left me and art lost in light,<br/>
		Cruel, between the shining hemispheres?<br/>
		Yet even there I will pursue my joy.<br/>
		Though all the great immortals jealously<br/>
		Encompass round with shields thy golden limbs,<br/>
		I may clash through them yet, or my strong patience<br/>
		Will pluck my love down from her distant stars.<br/>
		Still am I Ila’s son, Pururavus,<br/>
		That passionless pure strength though lost, though fallen<br/>
		From the armed splendid soul which once I was.”<br/>
		So saying he to the hall of session strode,<br/>
		Mightily like a king, a marble place<br/>
		With wide Titanic arches imminent,<br/>
		And from the brooding pillars seized a shell<br/>
		And blew upon it.
		Like a storm the sound<br/>
		Through Pratisthana’s streets was blown.
		Forth came<br/>
		From lintel proud and happy threshold low<br/>
		The people pouring out.
		Majestic chiefs<br/>
		And strong war-leaders and old famous men<br/>
		And mighty poets first; behind them streamed<br/>
		The Ilian people like driving rain, and filled</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 97</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-147">With faces the immeasurable hall.<br/>
		And over them the beautiful great king<br/>
		Rose bright; anticipations wonderful<br/>
		Of immortality flashed through his eyes<br/>
		And round his brow’s august circumference.<br/>
		“My people whom I made, I go from you;<br/>
		And what shall I say to you, Ilian people,<br/>
		Who know my glory and know my grief?
		Now I<br/>
		Endure no more the desolate wide rooms<br/>
		And gardens empty of her.
		I will depart<br/>
		And find her under imperishable trees<br/>
		Or secret beside streams.
		But since I go<br/>
		And leave my work behind and a young nation<br/>
		With destiny like an uncertain dawn<br/>
		Over it – Ayus her son, I give you.
		He<br/>
		By beauty and strength incomparable shall rule.<br/>
		Lo, I have planted earth with deeds and made<br/>
		The widest heavens my monument, have brought<br/>
		From Paradise the sempiternal fire<br/>
		And warred in heaven among the warring Gods.<br/>
		O people, you have shared my famous actions<br/>
		Done in a few great years of earthly life,<br/>
		The battles I fought, edifications vast,<br/>
		And perfect institutes that I have framed.<br/>
		High things we have done together, O my people.<br/>
		But now I go to claim back from the Gods<br/>
		Her they have taken from me, my dear reward.”<br/>
		He spoke and all the nation listened, dumb.<br/>
		Then was brought forth the bud of Urvasie,<br/>
		With Vedic verse intoned and Ganges pure<br/>
		Was crowned a king, and empire on his curls<br/>
		Established.
		But Pururavus went forth,<br/>
		Through ranks of silent people and gleaming arms,<br/>
		With the last cloud of sunset up the fields<br/>
		And darkening meadows.
		And from Ila’s rock,<br/>
		And from the temple of Ila virginal,<br/>
		A rushing splendour wonderfully arose</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 98</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-148">And shone all round the great departing king.<br/>

		And here a secret opening where she stood<br/>
		Waiting in narrow twilight; round her all<br/>
		Was green and secret with a mystic, dewy<br/>
		Half invitation into emerald worlds.<br/>
		O river, from thee she moved towards the glade<br/>
		Breathing and wet and fresh as if a flower<br/>
		All bare from rain.
		And thou, great holy glade,<br/>
		Sawest her face maternal o’er her child.”<br/>
		Then ceasing he would wait and listen, half</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 100</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-150">Expecting her.
		But all was silent; only<br/>
		Perhaps a bird darted bright-winged away,<br/>
		Or a grey snake slipped through the brilliant leaves.<br/>
		Thus wandering, thus in every mindful place<br/>
		Renewing old forgotten scenes that rose,<br/>
		Gleam after gleam, upon his mind, as stars<br/>
		Return at night; thus drawing from his heart<br/>
		Where they lay covered, old sweet incidents<br/>
		To live before his eyes; thus calling back<br/>

		Heart-freeing, he, materializing dreams,<br/>

		Between him and that passionate success.<br/>
		Therefore he murmured at last unsatisfied:<br/>
		“She is not here; though every mystic glade<br/>
		And sunbright pasture breathe alone of her<br/>
		And quiver as with her presence, I find not<br/>
		Her very limbs, her very face; yet dreamed<br/>
		That here infallibly I should restrain<br/>
		Her fugitive feet or hold her by the robe.<br/>
		O once she was the luminous soul of these,<br/>
		And in her body lived the summer and spring<br/>
		And seed and blossoming, ripening and fall,<br/>
		Hiding of Beauty in the wood and glen,<br/>
		And flashing out into the sunlit fields<br/>
		All flowers and laughter.
		All the happy moods<br/>
		And all the beautiful amorous ways of earth<br/>
		She was; but they now seem only her dress<br/>
		Left by her.
		Therefore, O ye seaward rivers,<br/>
		O forests, since ye have deceived my hope,<br/>
		I go from you to dazzling cruel ravines<br/>
		And find her on inclement mountains pure.”<br/>
		Then northward blown upon a storm of hope</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-151">The hero self-discrowned, Pururavus,<br/>
		Went swiftly up the burning plains and through<br/>
		The portals of the old Saivaalic hills<br/>
		To the inferior heights, nor lingered long,<br/>
		Though pulsing with fierce memories, though thrilled<br/>
		With shocks of a great passion touching earth;<br/>
		But plunged o’er difficult gorge and prone ravine<br/>
		And rivers thundering between dim walls,<br/>
		Driven by immense desire, until he came<br/>
		To dreadful silence of the peaks and trod<br/>
		Regions as vast and lonely as his love.<br/>
		Then with a confident sublime appeal<br/>
		He to the listening summits stretched his hands:<br/>
		“O desolate strong Himalaya, great<br/>
		Thy peaks alone with heaven and dreadful hush<br/>
		In which the Soul of all the world is felt<br/>
		Meditating creation!
		Thou, O mountain,<br/>
		My bridal chamber wast.
		On thee we lay<br/>
		With summits towards the moon or with near stars<br/>
		Watching us in some wild inhuman vale,<br/>
		Thy silence over us like a coverlid<br/>
		Or a far avalanche for bridal song.<br/>
		Lo, she is fled into your silences!<br/>
		I come to you, O mountains, with a heart<br/>
		Desolate like you, like you snow-swept, and stretch<br/>
		Towards your solemn summits kindred hands.<br/>
		Give back to me, O mountains, give her back.”<br/>
		He ceased and Himalaya bent towards him, white.<br/>
		The mountains seemed to recognize a soul<br/>
		Immense as they, reaching as they to heaven<br/>
		And capable of infinite solitude.<br/>
		Long he, in meditation deep immersed,<br/>
		Strove to dissolve his soul among the hills<br/>
		Into the thought of Urvasie.
		The snow<br/>
		Stole down from heaven and touched his cheek and hair,<br/>
		The storm-blast from the peaks leaped down and smote<br/>
		But woke him not, and the white drops in vain</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-152">Froze in his locks or crusted all his garb.<br/>
		For he lived only with his passionate heart.<br/>
		But as the months with slow unnoticed tread<br/>
		Passed o’er the hills nor brought sweet change of spring<br/>
		Nor autumn wet with dew, a voice at last<br/>
		Moved from far heavens, other than our sky.<br/>
		And he arose as one impelled and came<br/>
		Past the supreme great ridges northward, came<br/>
		Into the wonderful land far up the world<br/>
		Dim-looming, where the Northern Kurus dwell,<br/>
		The ancients of the world, invisible,<br/>
		Among forgotten mists.
		Through mists he moved<br/>
		Feeling a sense of unseen cities, hearing<br/>
		No sound, nor seeing face, but conscious ever<br/>
		Of an immense traditionary life<br/>
		Throbbing round him and dreams historical.<br/>
		For as he went, old kingly memories surged,<br/>
		And with vast forward faces driving came<br/>
		Origins and stabilities and empires,<br/>
		Huge passionate creations, impulses<br/>
		National realizing themselves in stone.<br/>
		Lastly with rolling of the mists afar<br/>
		He saw beneath him the primeval rocks<br/>
		Plunge down into the valley, and upsoar<br/>
		To light wide thoughtful domes and measureless<br/>
		Ramparts, and mid them in a glory walk<br/>
		The ancients of the world with eyes august.<br/>
		Next towards the sun he looked and saw enthroned<br/>
		Upon the summit one whose regal hair<br/>
		Crowned her, and purple in waves down to her feet<br/>
		Flowed, Indira, the goddess, Ocean’s child,<br/>
		Giver of empire who all beauty keeps<br/>
		Between her hands, all glory, all wealth, all power.<br/>
		Severe and beautiful she leaned her face.<br/>
		“What passion, Ilian Pururavus,<br/>

		And thou, O Ilian Pururavus,<br/>
		For passion dost thou leave thy strenuous grandeurs,<br/>

		With mournful rumour through the shades of Hell?”<br/>
		Then with calm eyes the hero Ilian:<br/>
		“O Goddess, patroness of Aryasthan,<br/>
		Lover of banyan and of lotus, I<br/>
		Not from the fear of Hell or hope of Heaven<br/>
		Do good or ill.
		Reigning I reigned o’er self,<br/>
		And with a kingly soul did kingly deeds.<br/>
		Now driven by a termless wide desire<br/>
		I wander over snow and countries vague.”<br/>
		And like a viol Luxmie answered him:<br/>
		“Sprung of the moon, thy grandsire’s fault in thee<br/>

		A virginal impulse gleamed from my bosom<br/>
		And on the earth took beauty and form.
		I saw<br/>
		Thee from that glory issue and rejoiced.<br/>
		But now thou comest quite discrowned.
		From me,<br/>
		O son, thou hadst the impulse beautiful<br/>

		O one day I shall turn from the great verse<br/>

		Led him and marvelled at him and praised with song<br/>
		His fair sublimity of form and brow<br/>
		And warlike limbs and grace heroical.<br/>
		He heeded not, for all his soul was straining<br/>

		In their immortal looks<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-161">In woodlands of the bright and early world,<br/>
		When love was to himself yet new and warm<br/>
		And stainless, played like morning with a flower<br/>
		Ruru with his young bride Priyumvada.<br/>
		Fresh-cheeked and dew-eyed white Priyumvada<br/>
		Opened her budded heart of crimson bloom<br/>
		To love, to Ruru; Ruru, a happy flood<br/>
		Of passion round a lotus dancing thrilled,<br/>
		Blinded with his soul’s waves Priyumvada.<br/>
		To him the earth was a bed for this sole flower,<br/>
		To her all the world was filled with his embrace.<br/>
		Wet with new rains the morning earth, released<br/>
		From her fierce centuries and burning suns,<br/>
		Lavished her breath in greenness; poignant flowers<br/>
		Thronged all her eager breast, and her young arms<br/>
		Cradled a childlike bounding life that played<br/>
		And would not cease, nor ever weary grew<br/>
		Of her bright promise; for all was joy and breeze<br/>
		And perfume, colour and bloom and ardent rays<br/>
		Of living, and delight desired the world.<br/>
		Then Earth was quick and pregnant tamelessly;<br/>
		A free and unwalled race possessed her plains<br/>
		Whose hearts uncramped by bonds, whose unspoiled thoughts<br/>
		At once replied to light.
		Foisoned the fields;<br/>
		Lonely and rich the forests and the swaying<br/>
		Of those unnumbered tops affected men<br/>
		With thoughts to their vast music kin.
		Undammed<br/>
		The virgin rivers moved towards the sea,<br/>
		And mountains yet unseen and peoples vague<br/>
		Winged young imagination like an eagle<br/>
		To strange beauty remote.
		And Ruru felt<br/>
		The sweetness of the early earth as sap<br/>
		All through him, and short life an aeon made<br/>
		By boundless possibility, and love,</p>

		As a bright bird comes flying<br/>
		From airy extravagance to his own home,<br/>
		And breasts his mate, and feels her all his goal,<br/>
		So from boon sunlight and the fresh chill wave<br/>
		Which swirled and lapped between the slumbering fields,<br/>
		From forest pools and wanderings mid leaves<br/>
		Through emerald ever-new discoveries,<br/>
		Mysterious hillsides ranged and buoyant-swift<br/>
		Races with our wild brothers in the meads,<br/>
		Came Ruru back to the white-bosomed girl,<br/>
		Strong-winged to pleasure.
		She all fresh and new<br/>
		Rose to him, and he plunged into her charm.<br/>
		For neither to her honey and poignancy<br/>
		Artlessly interchanged, nor any limit<br/>
		To the sweet physical delight of her<br/>
		He found.
		Her eyes like deep and infinite wells<br/>
		Lured his attracted soul, and her touch thrilled<br/>
		Not lightly, though so light; the joy prolonged<br/>
		And sweetness of the lingering of her lips<br/>
		Was every time a nectar of surprise<br/>
		To her lover; her smooth-gleaming shoulder bared<br/>
		In darkness of her hair showed jasmine-bright,<br/>
		While her kissed bosom by rich tumults stirred<br/>
		Was a moved sea that rocked beneath his heart.<br/>
		Then when her lips had made him blind, soft siege<br/>
		Of all her unseen body to his rule<br/>
		Betrayed the ravishing realm of her white limbs,<br/>
		An empire for the glory of a God.<br/>
		He knew not whether he loved most her smile,<br/>
		Her causeless tears or little angers swift,<br/>
		Whether held wet against him from the bath<br/>
		Among her kindred lotuses, her cheeks<br/>
		Soft to his lips and dangerous happy breasts<br/>
		That vanquished all his strength with their desire,<br/>
		Meeting his absence with her sudden face,<br/>
		Or when the leaf-hid bird at night complained</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-163">Near their wreathed arbour on the moonlit lake,<br/>

		Or breaking off like one who thinks of grief,<br/>
		Wonderful melancholy in her eyes<br/>
		Grown liquid and with wayward sorrow large.<br/>
		Thus he in her found a warm world of sweets,<br/>
		And lived of ecstasy secure, nor deemed<br/>
		Any new hour could match that early bliss.<br/>
		But Love has joys for spirits born divine<br/>
		More bleeding-lovely than his thornless rose.<br/>
		That day he had left, while yet the east was dark,<br/>
		Rising, her bosom and into the river<br/>

		Sharp-edged desire around his limbs, and sprang<br/>
		Wet to the bank, and streamed into the wood.<br/>
		As a young horse upon the pastures glad<br/>
		Feels greensward and the wind along his mane<br/>
		And arches as he goes his neck, so went<br/>
		In an immense delight of youth the boy<br/>
		And shook his locks, joy-crested.
		Boundlessly<br/>
		He revelled in swift air of life, a creature<br/>

		Grey-green at first, grew pallid with the light<br/>
		And warmed with consciousness of sunshine near;<br/>
		Then the whole daylight wandered in, and made<br/>
		Hard tracts of splendour, and enriched all hues.<br/>
		But when a happy sheltered heat he felt<br/>
		And heard contented voice of living things<br/>
		Harmonious with the noon, he turned and swiftly</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 116</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-164">Went homeward yearning to Priyumvada,<br/>
		And near his home emerging from green leaves<br/>
		He laughed towards the sun: “O father Sun,”<br/>
		He cried, “how good it is to live, to love!<br/>
		Surely our joy shall never end, nor we<br/>
		Grow old, but like bright rivers or pure winds<br/>
		Sweetly continue, or revive with flowers,<br/>
		Or live at least as long as senseless trees.”<br/>
		He dreamed, and said with a soft smile: “Lo, she!<br/>
		And she will turn from me with angry tears<br/>
		Her delicate face more beautiful than storm<br/>
		Or rainy moonlight.
		I will follow her,<br/>
		And soothe her heart with sovereign flatteries;<br/>
		Or rather all tyranny exhaust and taste<br/>
		The beauty of her anger like a fruit,<br/>
		Vexing her soul with helplessness; then soften<br/>
		Easily with quiet undenied demand<br/>
		Of heart insisting upon heart; or else<br/>
		Will reinvest her beauty bright with flowers,<br/>
		Or with my hands her little feet persuade.<br/>
		Then will her face be like a sudden dawn,<br/>
		And flower compelled into reluctant smiles.”<br/>
		He had not ceased when he beheld her.
		She,<br/>
		Tearing a jasmine bloom with waiting hands,<br/>
		Stood drooping, petulant, but heard at once<br/>
		His footsteps and before she was aware,<br/>
		A sudden smile of exquisite delight<br/>
		Leaped to her mouth, and a great blush of joy<br/>
		Surprised her cheeks.
		She for a moment stood<br/>
		Beautiful with her love before she died;<br/>
		And he laughed towards her.
		With a pitiful cry<br/>
		She paled; moaning, her stricken limbs collapsed.<br/>
		But petrified, in awful dumb surprise,<br/>
		He gazed; then waking with a bound was by her,<br/>
		All panic expectation.
		As he came,<br/>
		He saw a brilliant flash of coils evade<br/>

<p class="p-num">Page 117</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-165">Darted into green safety, hissing, death.<br/>

		O, she<br/>
		Was warm, and cruel hope pierced him; but pale<br/>
		As jasmines fading on a girl’s sweet breast<br/>
		Her cheek was, and forgot its perfect rose.<br/>
		Her eyes that clung to sunlight yet, with pain<br/>

		Against her bosom, sobbed out piteously,<br/>
		“Ah, love!” and stopped heart-broken; then, “O Love!<br/>
		Alas the green dear home that I must leave<br/>
		So early!
		I was so glad of love and kisses,<br/>
		And thought that centuries would not exhaust<br/>
		The deep embrace.
		And I have had so little<br/>
		Of joy and the wild day and throbbing night,<br/>

		I have not numbered half the brilliant birds<br/>

		Nor have with plaintive cries of birds made friends,<br/>
		Cuckoo and rainlark and love-speak-to-me.<br/>
		I have not learned the names of half the flowers<br/>
		Around me; so few trees know me by my name;<br/>
		Nor have I seen the stars so very often<br/>
		That I should die.
		I feel a dreadful hand<br/>
		Drawing me from the touch of thy warm limbs<br/>
		Into some cold vague mist, and all black night<br/>
		Descends towards me.
		I no more am thine,<br/>
		But go I know not where, and see pale shapes<br/>
		And gloomy countries and that terrible stream.<br/>
		O Love, O Love, they take me from thee far,<br/>
		And whether we shall find each other ever<br/>

		Slower her voice came now, and over her cheek<br/>

		The lovely discontented spirit stole<br/>
		From her warm body white.
		Over her leaned<br/>

		Still in the greenwood lay Priyumvada,<br/>
		And Ruru rose not from her, but with eyes<br/>
		Emptied of glory hung above his dead,<br/>
		Only, without a word, without a tear.<br/>
		Then the crowned wives of the great forest came,<br/>

		And grieved over the lovely body cold,<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-167">But Ruru, while the stillness of the place<br/>

		The cheeping of a bird just overhead,<br/>
		A peacock with his melancholy cry<br/>
		Complaining far away, and tossings dim<br/>
		And slight unnoticeable stir of trees.<br/>
		But all these were to him like distant things<br/>
		And he alone in his heart’s void.
		And yet<br/>
		No thought he had of her so lately lost.<br/>
		Rather far pictures, trivial incidents<br/>
		Of that old life before her delicate face<br/>
		Had lived for him, dumbly distinct like thoughts</p>

		Then he moved, then rigorous<br/>
		Memory through all his body shuddering<br/>
		Awoke, and he looked up and knew the place,<br/>
		And recognised greenness immutable,<br/>
		And saw old trees and the same flowers still bloom.<br/>
		He felt the bright indifference of earth<br/>
		And all the lonely uselessness of pain.<br/>
		Then lifting up the beauty of his brow<br/>
		He spoke, with sorrow pale: “O grim cold Death!<br/>
		But I will not like ordinary men<br/>
		Satiate thee with cries, and falsely woo thee,<br/>
		And make my grief thy theatre, who lie<br/>
		Prostrate beneath thy thunderbolts and make<br/>

		O secrecy terrific, darkness vast,<br/>
		At which we shudder!
		Somewhere, I know not where,<br/>
		Somehow, I know not how, I shall confront<br/>
		Thy gloom, tremendous spirit, and seize with hands<br/>
		And prove what thou art and what man.”
		He said,<br/>
		And slowly to the forest<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="44" href="#">1</a> wandered.
		There<br/>
		Long months he travelled between grief and grief,<br/>
		Reliving thoughts of her with every pace,<br/>
		Measuring vast pain in his immortal mind.<br/>
		And his heart cried in him as when a fire<br/>
		Roars through wide forests and the branches cry<br/>
		Burning towards heaven in torture glorious.<br/>
		So burned, immense, his grief within him; he raised<br/>
		His young pure face all solemnised with pain,<br/>
		Voiceless.
		Then Fate was shaken, and the Gods<br/>
		Grieved for him, of his silence grown afraid.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 120</p>

		For earth alarmed<br/>

		Divert the wrath<br/>

		So ended the young pure destroyer’s voice,<br/>

		In the same noon came Ruru; his mind had paused,<br/>

		So had she often stolen up and touched<br/>
		His curls with her enamoured fingers small,<br/>
		Lingering, while the wind smote him with her hair<br/>
		And her quick breath came to him like spring.
		Then he,<br/>
		Turning, as one surprised with heaven, saw<br/>
		Ready to his swift passionate grasp her bosom<br/>
		And body sweet expecting his embrace.<br/>
		Oh, now saw her not, but the guilty tree<br/>

		If we must anguish, yet it shall not part<br/>
		Our passionate limbs inextricably locked<br/>
		By one strong agony, but we shall feel<br/>
		Hell’s pain half joy through sweet companionship.<br/>
		God Love, I weary of words.
		O wing me rather<br/>
		To her, my eloquent princess of the spring,<br/>
		In whatsoever wintry shores she roam.”<br/>
		He ceased with eager forward eyes; once more<br/>
		A light of beauty immortal through the limbs<br/>
		Gleaming of the boy-god and soft sweet face,<br/>
		Glorifying him, flushed, and he replied:<br/>
		“Go then, O thou dear youth, and bear this flower<br/>
		In thy hand warily.
		For thou shalt come<br/>
		To that high meeting of the Ganges pure<br/>
		With vague and violent Ocean.
		There arise<br/>
		And loudly appeal my brother, the wild sea.”<br/>
		He spoke and stretched out his immortal hand,<br/>
		And Ruru’s met it.
		All his young limbs yearned<br/>
		With dreadful rapture shuddering through them.
		He<br/>
		Felt in his fingers subtle uncertain bloom,<br/>
		A quivering magnificence, half fire,<br/>
		Whose petals changed like flame, and from them breathed<br/>
		Dangerous attraction and alarmed delight,<br/>
		As at a peril near.
		He raised his eyes,<br/>
		But the green place was empty of the God.<br/>
		Only the faery tree looked up at heaven<br/>
		Through branches, and with recent pleasure shook.<br/>
		Then over fading earth the night was lord.</p><br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-181">By Aryan fathers not yet paced, but wild,<br/>

		Amazed, to trackless countries where few tribes,<br/>
		Kirath and Poundrian, warred, worshipping trees<br/>
		And the great serpent.
		But robust wild earth,<br/>
		But forests with their splendid life of beasts<br/>
		Savage mastered those strong inhabitants.<br/>
		Thither came Ruru.
		In a thin soft eve<br/>
		Ganges spread far her multitudinous waves,<br/>
		A glimmering restlessness with voices large,<br/>
		And from the forests of that half-seen bank<br/>
		A boat came heaving over it, white-winged,<br/>
		With a sole silent helmsman marble-pale.<br/>
		Then Ruru by his side stepped in; they went<br/>
		Down the mysterious river and beheld<br/>
		The great banks widen out of sight.
		The world<br/>
		Was water and the skies to water plunged.<br/>
		All night with a dim motion gliding down<br/>
		He felt the dark against his eyelids; felt,<br/>
		As in a dream more real than daylight,<br/>
		The helmsman with his dumb and marble face<br/>
		Near him and moving wideness all around,<br/>
		And that continual gliding dimly on,<br/>
		As one who on a shoreless water sails<br/>
		For ever to a port he shall not win.<br/>
		But when the darkness paled, he heard a moan<br/>
		Of mightier waves and had the wide great sense<br/>
		Of ocean and the depths below our feet.<br/>
		But the boat stopped; the pilot lifted on him<br/>
		His marble gaze coeval with the stars.<br/>
		Then in the white-winged boat the boy arose<br/>
		And saw around him the vast sea all grey<br/>
		And heaving in the pallid dawning light.<br/>
		Loud Ruru cried across the murmur: “Hear me,</p>

		The spheres of suffering where entangled dwell<br/>
		Souls unreleased and the untimely dead<br/>
		Who weep remembering.
		Thither, O, guide me,<br/>
		No despicable wayfarer, but Ruru,<br/>
		But son of a great Rishi, from all men<br/>
		On earth selected for peculiar pangs,<br/>
		Special disaster.
		Lo, this petalled fire,<br/>
		How freshly it blooms and lasts with my great pain!”<br/>
		He held the flower out subtly glimmering.<br/>
		And like a living thing the huge sea trembled,<br/>
		Then rose, calling, and filled the sight with waves,<br/>
		Converging all its giant crests; towards him<br/>
		Innumerable waters loomed and heaven<br/>
		Threatened.
		Horizon on horizon moved<br/>
		Dreadfully swift; then with a prone wide sound<br/>
		All Ocean hollowing drew him swiftly in,<br/>
		Curving with monstrous menace over him.<br/>
		He down the gulf where the loud waves collapsed<br/>
		Descending, saw with floating hair arise<br/>
		The daughters of the sea in pale green light,<br/>
		A million mystic breasts suddenly bare,<br/>
		And came beneath the flood and stunned beheld<br/>
		A mute stupendous march of waters race<br/>
		To reach some viewless pit beneath the world.<br/>
		Ganges he saw, as men predestined rush<br/>
		Upon a fearful doom foreseen, so run<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="49" href="#">6</a>,<br/>
		Alarmed, with anguished speed, the river vast.<br/>
		Veiled to his eyes the triple goddess rose.<br/>
		She with a sound of waters cried to him,<br/>
		A thousand voices moaning with one pain:<br/>
		“Lover, who fearedst not sunlight to leave,<br/>

		She darkened to the ominous descent,<br/>
		Unwilling, and her once so human waves<br/>
		Sent forth a cry not meant for living ears.<br/>
		And Ruru chilled; but terrible strong love<br/>
		Was like a fiery finger in his breast<br/>
		Pointing him on; so he through horror went<br/>
		Conducted by inexorable sound.<br/>
		For monstrous voices to his ear were close,<br/>
		And bodiless terrors with their dimness seized him<br/>
		In an obscurity phantasmal.
		Thus<br/>
		With agony of soul to the grey waste<br/>
		He came, glad of the pain of passage over,<br/>
		As men who through the storms of anguish strive<br/>
		Into abiding tranquil dreariness<br/>
		And draw sad breath assured; to the grey waste,<br/>
		Hopeless Patala, the immutable<br/>
		Country, where neither sun nor rain arrives,<br/>
		Nor happy labour of the human plough<br/>
		Fruitfully turns the soil, but in vague sands<br/>
		And indeterminable strange rocks and caverns<br/>
		That into silent blackness huge recede,<br/>
		Dwell the great serpent and his hosts, writhed forms,<br/>
		Sinuous, abhorred, through many horrible leagues<br/>
		Coiling in a half darkness.
		Shapes he saw,<br/>
		And heard the hiss and knew the lambent light<br/>
		Loathsome, but passed compelling his strong soul.<br/>
		At last through those six tired hopeless worlds,<br/>
		Too hopeless far for grief, pale he arrived<br/>
		Into a nether air by anguish moved,<br/>
		And heard before him cries that pierced the heart,<br/>
		Human, not to be borne, and issued shaken<br/>
		By the great river accursed.
		Maddened it ran,<br/>

		Torn piteous sides were seen and breasts that quailed.<br/>
		Over them moaned the penal waters on,<br/>
		And had no joy of their fierce cruelty.<br/>
		Then Ruru, his young cheeks with pity wan,<br/>
		Half moaned: “O miserable race of men,<br/>

		He leads<br/>

		O<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="50" href="#">7</a> my sweet flower,<br/>

		Or find thee out and clasp thy tortured bosom<br/>
		And kiss thy sweet wrung lips and hush thy cries.<br/>
		Love shall draw half thy pain into my limbs;<br/>
		Then we shall triumph glad of agony.”<br/>
		He ceased and one replied close by his ear:<br/>
		“O thou who troublest with thy living eyes<br/>
		Established death, pass on.
		She whom thou seekest<br/>
		Rolls not in the accursèd tide.
		For late<br/>
		I saw her mid those pale inhabitants<br/>
		Whom bodily anguish visits not, but thoughts<br/>
		Sorrowful and dumb memories absolve,<br/>
		And martyrdom of scourged hearts quivering.”<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-185">A mighty bridge paved with mosaic fire,<br/>

		“Pass on,” she said once more, “O Bhrigu’s son;<br/>

		She stretched<br/>
		One arm towards him and with violence<br/>
		Majestic over the horrid arch compelled.<br/>
		Unhurt, though shaking from her touch, alone<br/>
		He stood upon an inner bank with strange<br/>
		Black dreary mosses covered and perceived<br/>
		A dim and level plain without one flower.<br/>
		Over it paced a multitude immense<br/>
		With gentle faces occupied by pain;<br/>
		Strong men were there and grieving mothers, girls<br/>
		With early beauty in their limbs and young<br/>
		Sad children of their childlike faces robbed.<br/>
		Naked they paced with falling hair and gaze<br/>
		Drooping upon their bosoms, weak as flowers<br/>
		That die for want of rain unmurmuring.<br/>
		Always a silence was upon the place.<br/>
		But Ruru came among them.
		Suddenly<br/>

		Moves over a still field of patient corn,<br/>
		And the ears stir and shudder and look up<br/>
		And bend innumerably flowing, so<br/>
		All those dumb spirits stirred and through them passed<br/>
		One shuddering motion of raised faces; then<br/>
		They streamed towards him without sound and caught<br/>
		With desperate hands his robe or touched his hair<br/>
		Or strove to feel upon them living breath.<br/>
		Pale girls and quiet children came and knelt<br/>
		And with large sorrowful eyes into his looked.<br/>
		Yet with their silent passion the cold hush<br/>
		Moved not; but Ruru’s human heart half burst<br/>
		With burden of so many sorrows; tears</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 135</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-186">Welled from him; he with anguish understood<br/>
		That terrible and wordless sympathy<br/>

		Then he turned<br/>
		His eyes and scanned their lovely faces strange<br/>

		He paled,<br/>
		And spoke vain words into the listless air:<br/>
		“O spirits once joyous, miserable race,<br/>
		Happier if the old gladness were forgot!<br/>
		My soul yearns with your sorrow.
		Yet ah! reveal<br/>
		If dwell my love in your sad nation lost.<br/>
		Well may you know her, O wan beautiful spirits!<br/>
		But she most beautiful of all that died,<br/>
		By sweetness recognisable.
		Her name<br/>
		The sunshine knew.”
		Speaking his tears made way:<br/>
		But they with dumb lips only looked at him,<br/>
		A vague and empty mourning in their eyes.<br/>
		He murmured low: “Ah, folly! were she here,<br/>
		Would she not first have felt me, first have raised<br/>
		Her lids and run to me, leaned back her face<br/>
		Of silent sorrow on my breast and looked<br/>
		With the old altered eyes into my own<br/>
		And striven to make my anguish understand?<br/>
		Oh joy, had she been here! for though her lips<br/>
		Of their old excellent music quite were robbed,<br/>
		Yet her dumb passion would have spoken to me;<br/>
		We should have understood each other and walked<br/>
		Silently hand in hand, almost content.”<br/>
		He said and passed through those untimely dead.<br/>
		Speechless they followed him with clinging eyes.<br/>
		Then to a solemn building weird he came<br/>
		With grave colossal pillars round.
		One dome<br/>
		Roofed the whole brooding edifice, like cloud,<br/>
		And at the door strange shapes were pacing, armed.<br/>
		Then from their fear the sweet and mournful dead<br/>
		Drew back, returning to their wordless grief.<br/>
		But Ruru to the perilous doorway strode,<br/>
		And those disastrous shapes upon him raised</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 136</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-187">Their bows and aimed; but he held out Love’s flower,<br/>
		And with stern faces checked they let him pass.<br/>

		With flaming pediment and round it coiled<br/>
		Python and Naga monstrous, Joruthcaru,<br/>
		Tuxuc and Vasuki himself, immense,<br/>
		Magic Carcotaca all flecked with fire;<br/>
		And many other prone destroying shapes<br/>
		Coiled.
		On the wondrous dais rose a throne,<br/>
		And he its pedestal whose lotus hood<br/>
		With ominous beauty crowns his horrible<br/>
		Sleek folds, great Mahapudma; high displayed<br/>
		He bears the throne of Death.
		There sat supreme<br/>
		With those compassionate and lethal eyes,<br/>
		Who many names, who many natures holds;<br/>
		Yama, the strong pure Hades sad and subtle,<br/>
		Dharma, who keeps the laws of old untouched,<br/>
		Critanta, who ends all things and at last<br/>
		Himself shall end.
		On either side of him<br/>
		The four-eyed dogs mysterious rested prone,<br/>
		Watchful, with huge heads on their paws advanced;<br/>
		And emanations of the godhead dim<br/>
		Moved near him, shadowy or serpentine,<br/>
		Vast Time and cold irreparable Death.<br/>
		Then Ruru came and bowed before the throne;<br/>
		And swaying all those figures stirred as shapes<br/>
		Upon a tapestry moved by the wind,<br/>
		And the sad voice was heard: “What breathing man<br/>
		Bows at the throne of Hades?
		By what force,<br/>
		Spiritual or communicated, troubles<br/>
		His living beauty the dead grace of Hell?”<br/>
		And one replied who seemed a neighbouring voice:<br/>
		“He has the blood of Gods and Titans old.<br/>
		An Apsara his mother liquid-orbed</p>

		Love gave the flower that helps by anguish; therefore<br/>
		He chilled not with the breath of Hades, nor<br/>
		The cry of the infernal stream made stone.”<br/>
		But at the name of Love all hell was moved.<br/>
		Death’s throne half faded into twilight; hissed<br/>
		The phantoms serpentine as if in pain,<br/>
		And the dogs raised their dreadful heads.
		Then spoke<br/>
		Yama: “And what needs Love in this pale realm,<br/>
		The warm great Love?
		All worlds his breath confounds,<br/>
		Mars solemn order and old steadfastness.<br/>
		But not in Hell his legates come and go;<br/>
		His vernal jurisdiction to bare Hell<br/>
		Extends not.
		This last world resists his power<br/>
		Youthful, anarchic.
		Here will he enlarge<br/>
		Tumult and wanton joys?”
		The voice replied:<br/>
		“Menaca momentary on the earth,<br/>
		Heaven’s Apsara by the fleeting hours beguiled<br/>
		Played in the happy hidden glens; there bowed<br/>
		To yoke of swift terrestrial joys she bore,<br/>
		Immortal, to that fair Gundhurva king<br/>
		A mortal blossom of delight.
		That bloom<br/>
		Young Ruru found and plucked, but her too soon<br/>
		Thy fatal hooded snake on earth surprised,<br/>
		And he through gloom now travels armed by Love.”<br/>
		But then all Hades swaying towards him cried:<br/>
		“O mortal, O misled!

		Is stronger, nor may law of Hell or Heaven<br/>
		Its fierce effectual action supersede.<br/>
		Thy dead I yield.
		Yet thou bethink thee, mortal,<br/>

<blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-194">The story of Ruru and Pramadvura – I have substituted a name more manageable to
			the English tongue
			– her death in the forest by the snake and restoration at the price of half her husband’s life is told in
			the Mahabharata.
			It is a companion legend to the story of Savitri but not being told with any poetic skill or beauty has
			remained generally unknown.
			I have attempted in this poem to bring it out of its obscurity.
			For full success, however, it should have had a more faithfully Hindu colouring, but it was written a score
			of years ago when I had not penetrated to the heart of the Indian idea and its traditions, and the shadow of
			the Greek underworld and Tartarus with the sentiment of life and love and death which hangs about them has
			got into the legendary framework of the Indian Patala and hells.
			The central idea of the narrative alone is in the Mahabharata; the meeting with Kama and the descent into
			Hell were additions necessitated by the poverty of incident in the original story.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-195">In Bagdad by Euphrates, Asia’s river,<br/>
		Euphrates that through deserts must deliver<br/>
		The voices which of human daybreaks are<br/>
		Into the dim mysterious surge afar,<br/>
		The Arabian dwelt; after long travel he.<br/>
		Regions deserted, wastes of silent sea,<br/>
		Wide Ocean ignorant of ships and lands<br/>
		Never made glad by toil of mortal hands<br/>
		For he had seen, the Indian mountains bare<br/>
		Save of hard snow and the unbreathed huge air<br/>
		And swum through giant waters and had heard<br/>
		In those unhuman forests beast and bird,<br/>
		The peacock’s cry and tiger’s hoarse appeal<br/>
		Calling to God for prey, marked the vast wheel<br/>
		Of monstrous birds shadowing whole countries; he<br/>
		From Singhal through the long infinity<br/>
		Of southern floods had steered his shuddering ship<br/>
		Where unknown winds their lonely tumult keep.<br/>
		And he had lived with strong and pitiless men,<br/>
		Nations unhumanized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="53" href="#">2</a> by joy and pain,<br/>
		And he had tasted grain not sown by man<br/>
		And drunk strange milk in weird Mazinderan.<br/>
		Silent he was, as one whom thoughts attend,<br/>
		Distant, whom stiller hearts than ours befriend.<br/>
		He lived with memories only; no sweet voice<br/>
		Made the mute echoes of his life rejoice;<br/>
		No lovely face of children brought the dawn<br/>
		Into his home; but silent, calm, withdrawn,<br/>
		He watched the ways of men with godlike eyes<br/>
		Released from trammelling affinities<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="54" href="#">3</a>.<br/>
		Yet was he young and many women strove<br/>
		Vainly to win his marble mind to love.<br/>
		One day when wind had fled to the cool north<br/>
		And the strong earth was blind with summer, forth</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 148</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-196">The Arabian rode from great Bagdad and turned<br/>
		Into the desert.
		All around him burned<br/>
		The imprisoned spirit of fire; above his head<br/>
		The sky was like a tyranny outspread,<br/>
		The sun a fire in those heavens, and fire<br/>
		The sands beneath; the air burning desire<br/>
		And breathless, a plumb weight of flame; yet rode<br/>
		The Arabian unfeeling like a god.<br/>
		Three hours he rode and now no more was seen<br/>
		Bagdad, the imperial city, nor aught green,<br/>
		But the illimitable sands around<br/>
		Extend, a silent world waiting for sound,<br/>
		When in the distance he descried a grace<br/>
		Of motion beautiful in that dead place.<br/>
		Wondering he turned, but suddenly the horse<br/>
		Pricked up his slender ears, swerved from the course<br/>
		And pawing stood the unwilling air, nor heard<br/>
		The guiding voice nor the familiar word.<br/>
		Whinnying with wrath he smote the desert sand<br/>
		And mocked the rein and raged at the command.<br/>
		Then raised the man his face and saw above<br/>
		No cloud with the stark face of heaven strove,<br/>
		A single blaze of light from pole to pole.<br/>
		Smiling the Arabian spoke unto his soul.<br/>
		“Here too then are you strong, O influences<br/>
		That trouble the earth and air and the strong seas!<br/>
		Therefore I will not stay your gathering wings<br/>
		Who watch me from the air, you living things,<br/>
		But go to find whatever peril or wonder<br/>
		Wait me of life above the earth or under.<br/>
		Strange will it be if quiet Bagdad yield<br/>
		More terror or more sweetness than in field<br/>
		Has stayed me yet or in untravelled flood<br/>
		Or mountain or the tiger-throated wood.”<br/>
		So saying he grasped the strong and shaken mane<br/>
		And set swift footing on the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="55" href="#">4</a> fiery plain.<br/>
		At once the beast as if by sorcery</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 149</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-197">Strangely compelled, calmed his impetuous eye;<br/>
		His angry tremor ceased and bounding wrath<br/>
		Following unbidden in the Arabian’s path.<br/>
		But he with silent toil the sands untried<br/>
		Vanquishing through that luminous world and wide<br/>
		Went a slow shadow, till his feet untired<br/>
		The fruit of all his labour long acquired.<br/>
		Before a mile complete he was aware<br/>
		Of a strange shape of beauty sitting there<br/>
		On a sole boulder in the level wild,<br/>
		Maiden, a marvellous bloom, a naked child;<br/>
		All like a lily from her leaves escaped<br/>
		The golden summer kissed her close and wrapped<br/>
		In soft revealing sunshine,– a sweet bareness,<br/>
		A creature made of flowers and choicest fairness;<br/>
		And all her limbs were like a luminous dream,<br/>
		So wonderfully white they burn and gleam,<br/>
		Her shoulder ivory richly bathed in gold,<br/>
		Her sides a snowy wonder to behold,<br/>
		Marble made amorous; her body fair<br/>
		Seemed one with the divine, translucent air,<br/>
		A light within the light, a glorious treasure,<br/>
		A thing to hold, to kiss<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="56" href="#">5</a>, to slay with pleasure.<br/>
		This<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="57" href="#">6</a> girl was not alone, but with her watched<br/>
		Two shapes of beauty and of terror hatched,<br/>
		A strong, fierce snake, round her sweet middle twined,<br/>
		A tigress at her lovely feet reclined.<br/>
		Dreaming on those tremendous sands she waited<br/>
		And often with that splendour miscreated<br/>
		Played thoughtfully, about her wondrous knees<br/>
		Binding the brilliant death or would increase<br/>
		The whiteness of her limbs with its fierce hues<br/>
		Or twine it in her tresses flowing loose.<br/>
		Below that other restless evil played,<br/>
		The fierce, sleek terror on the sands outspread.<br/>
		First of the wonderful three rose with a bound<br/>
		Waking the desert from its sleep with sound</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 150</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-198">The tigress, but the Arabian strode more near<br/>
		As one who had forgotten how to fear<br/>
		And frowning like a god with kingly look<br/>
		He threatened the preparing death and shook<br/>
		His javelin in the sun.
		Back crouched the fiend<br/>
		Amazed nor could the steely light attend<br/>
		Nor that unconquerable glance; yet lowered<br/>
		To find her dreadful violence overpowered<br/>
		By any smaller thing than death; and he<br/>
		Heeded no more crouched limb nor stealthy eye.<br/>
		He on that flowerlike shape a moment gazed<br/>
		As one by strange felicity amazed,<br/>
		Who long grown sorrow’s friend his whole life grieves,<br/>
		Blest beyond expectation, scarce believes<br/>
		That joy is in his heart – so gazed, so laid<br/>
		At last upon the white and gleaming maid<br/>
		The question of his hands.
		O soft and real<br/>
		The nakedness he grasped, no marble ideal<br/>
		Born of the blazing light and infinite air,<br/>
		A breathing woman with lovely limbs and bare.<br/>
		Then with a strong melodious voice he cried<br/>
		And all his cheek was flushed with royal<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="58" href="#">7</a> pride.<br/>
		“Thou then art mine, after long labour mine,<br/>
		O earthly body and O soul divine,<br/>
		After long labour and thy sounding home<br/>
		Hast left and caverns where thy sisters roam,<br/>
		O dweller where the austral tempest raves!<br/>
		O daughter of the wild and beautiful waves!<br/>
		Ah<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="59" href="#">8</a> breasts of beauty!

		The ivory swiftness of thy feet and strength<br/>
		Of this immortal body shaped for kings,<br/>
		O memory of sweet and dreadful things!<br/>
		Ah welcome to the streets that human tread<br/>
		Makes musical and joy of human bread<br/>

		For human passion and for womanly duty<br/>
		And softer in my bosom shalt thou sleep<br/>
		Than lulled by the sublime and monstrous deep.<br/>
		Much have I laboured; the resplendent face<br/>
		Of summer I have hated, as the days<br/>
		Went by and no delightful brook was found<br/>
		Sprinkling with earth’s cool love the ruthless ground,<br/>
		And in my throat there was a desert’s thirst<br/>
		And on my tongue a fire: I have cursed<br/>
		The spring and all its flowers: the wrathful cry<br/>
		Of the wild waters and their cruelty<br/>
		I have endured, labouring with sail and oar<br/>
		Through the mad tempest for some human shore<br/>
		And fought with winds, and seen vast Hell aflame<br/>
		Down in the nether flood till I became<br/>
		Blind with the sight of those abysmal graves<br/>
		And deaf with the eternal sound of waves<br/>
		And all my heart was broken alone to be<br/>
		Day after day with the unending sea.<br/>
		And much on land I have laboured without moan<br/>
		Or weakening tears making my heart a stone.<br/>
		But thou art come and I shall hear no more<br/>
		By inexorable rocks the Ocean roar,<br/>
		Nor pine in dungeons far from pity or aid.<br/>
		But in far other prison, seaborn maid,<br/>
		Thy limbs shall minister to my delight<br/>
		Even as an ordinary woman’s might.<br/>
		And I shall hear thy voice around my heart<br/>
		Like a cool rivulet and shall not start<br/>
		To see thee ivory gleaming and all night<br/>
		Shall feel thee in my arms, O darling white –<br/>
		With afterjoys that spring from these; the face<br/>
		Of childish loveliness shall light my days,</p>

		Bend sworded fingers to their sweet commands.<br/>
		O bright felicity, labour’s dear end,<br/>
		Into my arms, into my heart descend.”<br/>
		So as he spoke, the silent desert air<br/>
		Lived with his gladness, and the maiden there<br/>
		Listened with downcast lids and a soft flush<br/>
		Upon her like the coming of a blush.<br/>
		But when he finished and the air was mute,<br/>
		She laughed with happy lips most like a flute<br/>
		Or voice of cuckoo in an Indian grove<br/>
		Waking the heart to vague delightful love.<br/>
		And with divine eyes gleaming where strange mirth<br/>
		A smiling mischief was, the living girth<br/>
		Of her delicious waist she suddenly<br/>
		Unbound and by the middle lifting high<br/>
		Betwixt them shook.
		Hissed the fierce snake and raised<br/>
		Its jewelled hood for spotted radiance praised,<br/>
		Its jewelled hood to the dread leap distended<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="63" href="#">12</a>:<br/>
		Sad limit of noble life, had that descended<br/>
		Since short his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="64" href="#">13</a> breath and evil, who that pang<br/>
		Experienced; but before the serpent sprang,<br/>
		Wrathful, the Arabian seized the glittering neck<br/>
		And twines of bronze burning with many a fleck<br/>
		Of coloured fire.
		His angry grasp to quell<br/>
		Vainly the formidable folds rebel:<br/>
		Not all that gordian force and slippery strength<br/>
		Of coils availed.
		Inanimate at length,<br/>
		The immense destroyer on the Arabian’s wrist<br/>
		Hung in a ruin loose; and to resist<br/>
		His<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="65" href="#">14</a> wrath of love none now might intervene,<br/>
		Nor she deny him.
		Yet with tranquil mien<br/>
		Smiling she sat and swept with noble gesture</p>

		In each kissed place.
		“Deemedst thou then,” he cried,<br/>
		“Bright fugitive, lovely wanderer with the tide,<br/>
		By shaking death before death-practised eyes<br/>
		My crown to wrest of strenuous enterprise,<br/>
		Thyself, thyself and beauty?
		O too sweet<br/>
		To touch our hard earth with thy faultless feet!<br/>
		Yet on hard earth must dwell.
		For with the ground<br/>
		Thy dreadful guardians who have fenced thee round<br/>
		Are equalled, and thyself, sweet, though thou shame<br/>
		The winds with swiftness or like mounting flame<br/>
		Strive all thy days in my imprisoning arms,<br/>
		Couldst burn thyself no exit.
		With alarms<br/>
		Menace and shapes of death; call on the flood<br/>
		For thy deliverance on these sands to intrude<br/>
		And lead thee to its jealous waters rude;<br/>
		But hands that have flung back the swallowing sea<br/>
		Shall stay and chastise and habituate thee<br/>
		To service due.”
		He said and with the words<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="66" href="#">15</a><br/>
		The power in his soul increased, as birds<br/>
		With sounds encourage love and like great waves<br/>
		Exulting, rose against the breasts he craves,<br/>
		So he engrossed the lovely limbs.
		Then grasping<br/>
		Her fair soft arm in one hand, the other clasping<br/>
		Her smooth desirèd thighs, from that rude seat,<br/>
		The grey sun-blistered boulder most unmeet<br/>
		To bear her snowwhite radiance, lifted.
		She<br/>
		As to his horse he bore her mightily,<br/>
		A little strove in his strong arms, but round<br/>
		Her lithe, reluctant limbs closer he bound<br/>
		His despot hands and on the saddle set<br/>
		Never with such sweet rider burdened yet.<br/>
		Then to his seat he sprang and musical</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-202">His cry in that vast silence, wherewithal<br/>
		He urged his horse, which delicately went<br/>
		Arching its neck with joy and proud content.<br/>
		Great were the Arabian’s labours; many seas<br/>
		He had passed and borne impossible miseries<br/>
		And battled with impracticable ills<br/>
		O’er uncrossed rivers and forbidden hills,<br/>
		Till nature fainted.
		Yet too little was this<br/>
		To merit all the heaven now made his.<br/>
		For she, earth’s wonder hard to grasp as fire,<br/>
		She whom all ocean’s secret depths admire,<br/>
		Laid her delicious cheek to his and flung<br/>
		Sweet, bare arms on his neck and round him clung:<br/>
		Her snowy side was of his being a part;<br/>
		Her naked breast burdened his throbbing heart,<br/>
		And all her hair streamed over him and the whiteness<br/>
		Of her was in his eyes and her soft brightness<br/>
		A joy beneath his hands, to his embrace<br/>
		And he was clothed with her as in a dress.<br/>
		Round them the strong recovered coils were rolled<br/>
		Of the great snake and with imperious fold<br/>
		Compelled their limbs together, and by their side<br/>
		Pacing the tigress checked her dangerous stride.<br/>
		So rode they like a vision.
		All the time<br/>
		She murmured accents as of linkèd rhyme<br/>
		Musical, in a language like the sea,<br/>
		Accents of undulating melody.<br/>
		For sometimes it was like a happy noon<br/>
		Murmuring with waves and sometimes like the swoon<br/>
		Of calm, a silence heard, or rich by noise<br/>
		Of rivers pouring with their seaward voice<br/>
		And leaping laughters and sometimes was wild<br/>
		And passionate as the sobbing of a child.<br/>
		But often it was like the cold salt spray<br/>
		On a health-reddened cheek and glad with day<br/>
		And life and sad with the far-moaning call<br/>
		Of wind upon the waters funeral.</p>

		Now of that magic tongue no separate word<br/>
		Was of Alnuman understood nor<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="67" href="#">16</a> heard,<br/>
		And yet he knew that of the caves she spoke<br/>
		Where never earthly light of sunshine woke,<br/>
		And of unfathomed things beneath the floods<br/>
		And peopled depths and Ocean solitudes<br/>
		And mighty creatures of the main and light<br/>
		Of jewels making a subluminous night<br/>
		Lower than even the dead may sink; and walls<br/>
		Of coral and in what majestic halls<br/>
		The naked seaborn sisters link their dance;<br/>
		How sometimes on the shores their white limbs glance<br/>
		In the mysterious moonlight; how they come<br/>
		To river-banks far from their secret home;<br/>
		And last she spoke of mighty Love that reaches<br/>
		Resistless arms beyond the long sea-beaches<br/>
		And mocks the barriers of the storm, and how<br/>
		Pearls unattainable a human brow<br/>
		Have decked and man, the child of misery,<br/>
		Been mated with the sisters of the sea.<br/>
		So on she murmured like a ceaseless song<br/>
		Making the weary sands a rapture; long<br/>
		The patient desert round them waits; nor soon<br/>
		The sun toiled through the endless afternoon:<br/>
		But they paced always like a marvellous dream,<br/>
		And dreamlike in the eyes of man might seem<br/>
		Such magic vision (had human eyes been found<br/>
		In the sole desert void of sign or bound),–<br/>
		The horse that feared its dread companion not;<br/>
		The kingly man with brow of reaching thought<br/>
		And danger-hardened strength; fair as the morn,<br/>
		The radiant girl upon his saddle borne,<br/>
		Naked, a vision not of earth; the fell<br/>
		Serpent that twined about them, terrible<br/>
		With burning hues; and the fierce tigress there</p>

		The portals of Pataala<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="71" href="#">1</a> are and there<br/>
		The Bhogavathie with her sinuous waves<br/>
		Rises, a river alien to the sun,<br/>
		And often to its strange and gleaming sands<br/>
		Uloupie came, weary of those dim shades<br/>
		And great disastrous caverns neighbouring Hell,<br/>
		Avid of sunlight.
		Through the grasses long<br/>
		She glided and her fierce and gorgeous hood<br/>
		Gleamed with a perilous beauty and a light<br/>
		Above the green spikes of the grass; often<br/>
		In the slow sinuous waters she was spied<br/>
		Swimming, with mystic dusky hair and cheeks<br/>
		That had no rose,– one shoulder’s dipping glow<br/>
		Through water and one white breast hardly seen.<br/>
		But as she swam she looked towards the west<br/>
		Dreaming of daily sunlight and of flowers<br/>
		That need soft rain and of the night with stars,<br/>
		A friendly darkness and the season’s change<br/>
		In beautiful Aryavertha far away,<br/>
		The country of the Gods, and yet sometimes<br/>
		Vaguely expectant to the southward gazed.</p><br/>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-212">Then

		And in her city mid the eastern hills<br/>
		Chitrangada awoke and saw the dawn<br/>
		Presaged in bleakness.
		From Urjoona’s arms<br/>
		Unclasping her rose-white smooth limbs, she looked<br/>
		Into the opening world; but all was grey<br/>
		And formless.
		Then into her mood there passed<br/>
		The spirit of the gloomy northern hills<br/>
		Burdening her breasts with terror and her heart<br/>
		Was bared to insight, and new-heard a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="73" href="#">3</a> moan<br/>
		Of waters and remembered pain.
		The sad<br/>
		Prophecies of the pale astrologers</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 166</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-213">Haunted her with affliction, and she found<br/>
		Pale hints of absence from the twilight drawn.<br/>
		But now the hero felt his clasp a void<br/>
		And on one arm half-rising searched the grey<br/>
		Unlidded darkness for the face; then spoke<br/>
		Slowly her name, “How has the unborn day<br/>
		Called thee, belovèd<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="74" href="#">4</a>, that thou standest dumb<br/>
		In the grey light like one whose joy is far?<br/>
		Come hither.”
		Silently she came and knelt<br/>
		And laid her quiet cheek upon his breast.<br/>
		He felt her tears, wondering; and she replied,<br/>
		“Ah, dost thou love me and a moment brief<br/>
		Of absence troubles even in sleep thy heart<br/>
		Waking to emptiness?
		And yet, ah God,<br/>
		How easily that void will soon be filled!<br/>
		For thou wilt like a glorious burning move<br/>
		Through cities and through regions like a star,<br/>
		Careless in thy heroic strength o’er all<br/>
		The beautiful country Aryavertha.
		Women<br/>
		Will see thy face and strangely, swiftly drawn<br/>
		Thy masculine attraction feel and bow<br/>
		Over thy feet.
		For thou wilt come to them<br/>
		A careless glory taking women’s hearts<br/>
		As one breaks from a tree the wayside flowers,<br/>
		And smile, securely<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="75" href="#">5</a> kind, even as a god<br/>
		Might draw a mortal maiden to his arms<br/>
		And marry his immortal mouth to hers.<br/>
		Then will thy destiny seize thee; thou wilt pass<br/>
		Like some great light in heaven, leaving behind<br/>
		A splendid memory of force and fire.<br/>
		And thou wilt fill thy soul with battle, august<br/>
		Misfortunes and tremendous harms embrace,<br/>
		Experience mighty raptures and at last<br/>
		Upon some world-renowned far-rumoured field<br/>
		Empire for ever win or lose, nor all<br/>
		The while think once of my forgotten face.”<br/>
		She ceased and wept; he said, touching her hair,</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-214">“What wast thou musing, O Chitrangada,<br/>
		Lonely beside the window and thine eyes<br/>
		Looked out on the half-formed aspect of things<br/>
		Twixt light and darkness?
		Do not so again.<br/>
		For bleak and dreadful is the hour ere dawn<br/>
		And one who gazes out then from his sweet,<br/>
		Warm, happy, bounded human room, is touched<br/>
		With awful memories that he cannot grasp<br/>
		And mighty sorrows without form, the sense<br/>
		Of an original vastness desolate,<br/>
		Bleak labour and a sad unfinished world.<br/>
		Dwell not with these again, but when thou wakest<br/>
		And seest the unholy hour pallid gaze<br/>
		Into thy room, draw closer to my bosom<br/>

		Thy soul until God rises with the sun.<br/>
		Friendly to mortals is the living sun’s<br/>
		Great brilliant light; but this pale hour was made<br/>
		For slowly-dying men whose lone chilled souls<br/>
		Grow near to that greyness and dumb mourners<br/>
		Unfriended.”
		But Chitrangada replied,<br/>
		“I looked into the dawn and had a dream.<br/>

		That sound of trampling horsehooves in the north<br/>
		And victor rumours of thy chariot shook<br/>

		I sat alone<br/>
		At this pale window and about me saw<br/>
		My city and our low familiar hills.<br/>
		Yet these were but as objects painted in<br/>
		Upon the eye, and round me I beheld<br/>
		The gloomy northern mountains with their mists<br/>
		And sorrowful embracing rains and heard<br/>
		With melancholy voices rolling down<br/>
		The waters of a dull, ill-omened stream<br/>
		Sinuous and eddies alien to the sun.<br/>
		That thou wilt pass from me I know, nor would<br/>
		I stay thee, had I power: for if today</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-215">I held thy feet, yet as the seasons passed,<br/>
		The impulse of thy mighty life would come<br/>
		Upon thee like a wind and drive thee forth<br/>
		To love and battle and disastrous deeds<br/>
		And all the giant anguish that preserves<br/>
		This world.
		Thou as resistlessly wast born<br/>
		To these things as the leopard sleek to strength<br/>
		And beauty and fierceness, as resistlessly<br/>
		As women are to love; though well they know<br/>
		Pain for the end, yet knowing still must love.<br/>
		Ah swiftly pass.
		Why shouldst thou linger here<br/>
		Vainly?
		How will it serve God’s purpose in thee<br/>
		To tarry soothing for such brief while longer<br/>
		Merely a woman’s heart; meanwhile perhaps<br/>
		Lose some great moment of thy life which once<br/>
		Neglected never can return.”
		She ceased<br/>
		And strove to conquer overmastering tears.<br/>
		He was silent a little, then his eyes<br/>
		Strained towards the dim-seen fairness of her face,<br/>
		Saying, “O little loving child, who once<br/>
		Wast simply glad to love and feel my kiss!<br/>
		But now thou mournest, art in one night changed.<br/>
		Thou wast not wont to leave my arms ere dawn<br/>
		And dream of sorrow.
		Rather wast thou fain<br/>
		Of all my bosom and the gazing light<br/>
		Hardly could force away thy obstinate clasp.<br/>
		Yet now thou speakst of absence easily.<br/>
		Is my love faded?
		Dost thou feel my arms<br/>
		Looser about thee, my belovèd<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="77" href="#">7</a>?
		Nay,<br/>
		Thou knowest that not less but more I love thee<br/>
		Than when to eastern Monipura far<br/>
		I came, a wandering prince companioned only<br/>
		By courage and my sword and found thee here,<br/>
		O sweet young sovereign, ruling with pure eyes<br/>
		And little maiden hand, fragile and mild,<br/>
		A strong and savage nation.
		At my call<br/>
		Unquestioning thou camest, oh, meekly down</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-216">Leaving tremendous seat and austere powers,<br/>

		Thy love was, opening to me fragrantly<br/>
		Like flowers to the sun, wide-orbed, and yielded<br/>
		Thy whole self up.
		Yet now thou speakest sadly<br/>
		Too like a mind matured by thought and pain.”<br/>
		He ceased, covering her bosom with his hands,<br/>
		And she trembled, and broke out faltering.<br/>
		“O endlessness of moments and the long<br/>
		Rain-haunted<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="78" href="#">8</a> nights when thou art far!
		O me<br/>
		And the pale dreadful dawn when I shall wake<br/>
		In the grey hour and feel myself alone<br/>
		For ever!
		Yet O my rapture and pride!
		O prince,<br/>
		O hero, O strong protagonist of earth!<br/>
		World-conqueror! and in heaven immortal lips<br/>
		Burning have kissed thy feet, but I possessed.<br/>
		God knows that I have loved thee, not with grudging<br/>
		Piecemeal reluctant cessions of the soul<br/>
		As ordinary women love, but greatly<br/>
		With one glad falling at my conqueror’s feet<br/>
		All suddenly and warmly like the Spring.<br/>
		Ah God, thy beauty when it dawned on me<br/>
		And I obeyed thy bright attraction! felt<br/>
		Thy face like the great moon that draws the tides!<br/>
		Facing our armèd senate, bow in hand<br/>
		Leaned on a pillar with a banner’s pomp<br/>
		Seeming to mingle in thy hair thou stoodst<br/>
		Expectant, careless, and thy strong gracious face<br/>
		Was brilliant like a sudden god’s.
		And half<br/>
		I rose up as one called.
		But even then<br/>
		Through all the hushed assembly ran a murmur,<br/>
		An impulse and a movement and with cries<br/>
		Round thee my strong barbarian nobles pressed</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 170</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-217">Offering fierce homage.
		But I sat alone,<br/>
		Abandoned, with a wounded sad delight,<br/>

		Thou tookst me by the hand and ledst me down<br/>
		From the high daïs<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="79" href="#">9</a> and the ancient throne:<br/>
		Faltering I went with meek submissive eyes.”<br/>
		Then strong Urjoon<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="80" href="#">10</a>: “Beloved, and was this not<br/>
		Dearer, a woman’s bliss in her one lord<br/>
		Than ruling all those kings?
		Dost thou not choose<br/>

		Than those free virgin and unconscious limbs?<br/>
		Ah wherefore shouldst thou dream of love cut short<br/>
		And joy without its sequel?
		Rather think<br/>
		That thy young passion shall to matron bloom<br/>
		Live warmly enriched and beautifully changed<br/>
		When thou with the hushed wonder of motherhood<br/>
		Touching thy sweet young eyes holdst up to me<br/>
		Returning from high battle to thine arms<br/>
		A creature of our own.”
		And she answered<br/>
		With a low sob, “Would God that it might be!<br/>
		But though I loved thee I have known I was<br/>
		No real part of thy great days; only<br/>
		A bosom on which thou hast lain ere riding<br/>
		To battle, a face which thou hast loved and passed.<br/>
		Hero, take up thy bow!
		Warrior, arise!<br/>
		Proceed with thy majestic mission.
		Thou<br/>
		From many mighty spirits wast selected<br/>
		And mayst not for a transient joy renounce<br/>
		The anguish and the crown.
		But I<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="81" href="#">11</a> shall witness<br/>
		Thy far-off pomps, not utterly alone;<br/>
		As herdsmen pausing under quiet leaves<br/>
		Watch the stupendous passage of a host,<br/>
		Shrill neigh of horses, chariots swift and men<br/>
		Marching, and hear great conchshells blown, and look<br/>
		Into the burning eyes of kings.
		Some wave<br/>
		Of thy vast fate perhaps shall roll thee here</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 171</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-218">Ere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="82" href="#">12</a> all is over; for<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="83" href="#">13</a> the long round of things<br/>

		      She ended and Urjoona for a moment<br/>
		Beheld vast Aryavertha as if mapped<br/>
		Before him, rivers, heaven-invading<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86" href="#">16</a> hills<br/>
		And cities ancient as their skies; then turned<br/>
		And drawing to his bosom Chitrangada<br/>
		With his calm strength surrounding her replied:<br/>
		“This may be; yet, O woman, O delight,<br/>
		Remember to rejoice!
		Flowers die, beloved,<br/>
		To live again; therefore hold fast to love,<br/>
		Hold fast the blooming of thy life in love.<br/>
		The soul’s majestic progress moulding doom<br/>
		Is with the frailest flower helped that blows<br/>
		In frankness.
		Therefore is the woman’s part<br/>
		Nearest divine, who to one motion keeps<br/>
		And like the fixed immortal planets’ round<br/>
		Is constant to herself in him she loves.<br/>
		Nor though fate call me hence, have I in vain<br/>
		Loved thee, young virgin of the hills, and snared<br/>
		Thy feet with kisses; though my soul from thee<br/>
		Adventure journeying like a star the void,–<br/>
		As ’tis our spirit’s fate ever to roam<br/>
		Seeking bright portions of ourself, which found<br/>
		The strong heart cherishes until his close.<br/>
		Relinquish nothing grasped; who yieldeth aught<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="87" href="#">17</a><br/>
		To fate or weakness, misses the great goal; –<br/>
		So have I planted thee within my heart,<br/>
		O tender beauty, and shall not lightly lose.<br/>
		Though years divide us and the slow upgrowth<br/>
		Of overlaying thoughts submerge the peace,<br/>
		The sweet and mutual self – yet the old joy<br/>
		Lives like Valmekie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="88" href="#">18</a> in his mound,– the sage,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 172</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-219">Buried, forgot, but<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="89" href="#">19</a> murmuring the

		Let us not lose then, O Chitrangada,<br/>
		One moment’s possibility of love<br/>
		Which being squandered, we shall then regret.<br/>
		Fate that united once, may when she will<br/>
		Divorce, but cannot the sweet meaning spoil<br/>
		Of these warm kisses.”
		He embraced her wholly<br/>
		Confounding her with bliss; so for that time<br/>
		The Shadow fled and joy forgot his close.<br/>
		      But one pale morn Chitrangada rose wan<br/>
		And to the stable through the grey hushed place<br/>
		Descending, with her little deft hands yoked<br/>
		Urjoona’s coursers to the car,– persuading<br/>
		Thrust in their whinnying mouths the bit, fastened<br/>
		The traces, harmonised the reins, then led<br/>
		Into the sad dim court trampling his steeds;<br/>
		And with a strange deep look of love and hate<br/>
		Caressing said, faint with her unshed tears:<br/>
		“You brought him here who now shall bear away,<br/>
		O horses yoked to fate.
		How often yet<br/>
		Will you deceive us shaking wide your manes<br/>
		And trampling over women’s hearts with hooves<br/>
		Thunderous towards battle?
		Yet your breed perhaps<br/>
		Shall bring him to my wrinkled age.”
		And now<br/>
		Urjoona came: his mailed and resonant tread<br/>
		Rang in her very heart, his corslet blazed<br/>
		Towards the chill skies and his heroic form<br/>
		Seemed to consent with the surrounding hills.<br/>
		But in the marble face and eyes august<br/>
		The light of his tremendous fate had dawned<br/>
		Like a great sunrise.

<p class="P" search_id="CP-285">I dreamed that in myself the world I saw,<br/>
		Wherein three Angels strove for mastery.
		Law<br/>
		Was one, clear vision and denial cold,<br/>
		Yet in her limits strong, presumptuous, bold;<br/>
		The second with enthusiasm bright,<br/>
		Flame in her heart but round her brows the night,<br/>
		Faded as this advanced.
		She could not bear<br/>
		That searching gaze, nor the strong chilling air<br/>
		These thoughts created, nourishing our parts<br/>
		Of mind, but petrifying human hearts.<br/>
		Science was one, the other gave her name,<br/>
		Religion.
		But a third behind them came,<br/>
		Veiled, vague, remote, and had as yet no right<br/>
		Upon the world, but lived in her own light.<br/>
		Wide were the victories of the Angel proud<br/>
		Who conquered now and in her praise were loud<br/>
		The nations.
		Few even yet to the other clove,–<br/>
		And some were souls of night and some were souls of love.<br/>
		But this was confident and throned.
		Her heralds ranged<br/>
		Claiming that night was dead and all things changed;<br/>
		For all things opened, all seemed clear, seemed bright –<br/>
		Save the vast ranges that they left in night.<br/>
		However, the light they shed upon the earth<br/>
		Was great indeed, a firm and mighty birth.<br/>
		A century’s progress lived before my eyes.<br/>
		Delivered from amazement and surprise,<br/>
		Man’s spirit measuring his worlds around<br/>
		The laws of sight divined and laws of sound.<br/>
		Light was not hidden from her<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="123" href="#">1</a> searching gaze,<br/>
		Nor matter could deny its<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="124" href="#">2</a> myriad maze<br/>

		Their unremembered secrets.
		Horses of steam<br/>
		Were bitted and the lightnings made a team<br/>
		To draw our chariots.
		Heaven was scaled at last<br/>
		And the loud seas subdued.
		Distance resigned<br/>
		Its strong obstructions to the mastering mind.<br/>
		So moved that spirit trampling; then it laid<br/>
		Its hand at last upon itself, how this was made<br/>
		Wondering, and sought to class and sought to trace<br/>
		Mind by its forms, the wearer by the dress.<br/>
		Then the other arose and met that spirit robust,<br/>

		Her question shall await thee.
		That reply,<br/>
		As all we must; for they who cannot, die.<br/>
		She slays them and their mangled bodies lie<br/>
		Upon the highways of eternity.<br/>
		Therefore, if thou wouldst live, know first this thing,<br/>
		Who thou art in this dungeon labouring.”<br/>
		And Science confidently, “Nothing am I but earth,<br/>
		Tissue and nerve and from the seed a birth,<br/>
		A mould, a plasm, a gas, a little that is much.<br/>
		In these grey cells that quiver to each touch<br/>
		The secret lies of man; they are the thing called I.<br/>
		Matter insists and matter makes reply.<br/>
		Shakespeare was this; this force in Jesus yearned<br/>
		And conquered by the cross; this only learned<br/>
		The secret of the suns that blaze afar;<br/>
		This was Napoleon’s giant mind of war.”</p>

		And from the heart of an approaching light<br/>
		One said to man, “Know thyself infinite,<br/>

		Then from our hills the ancient answer pealed,<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-480">O Boers, you have dared much and much endured<br/>
		For freedom, your strong simple hearts inured<br/>
		To danger and privation nor so made<br/>
		As by death’s daily grasp to be dismayed,<br/>
		Nor numbers nor disasters in the field,<br/>
		Nor to o’erwhelming multitudes to yield.<br/>
		It was no secondary power you faced,<br/>
		But she who has the whole wide world embraced,<br/>
		England whose name is as the thunder, she<br/>
		Whose navies are the despots of the sea,<br/>
		Napoleon’s conqueror whose fair dreadful face<br/>
		Great nations loathe and fear and choose disgrace<br/>
		Rather than meet in wild and dangerous war<br/>
		Victors of Waterloo and Trafalgar.<br/>
		But you, a band of armèd herdsmen small,<br/>
		Feared not her strength, her pride imperial,<br/>
		Nor all the union of her empire huge,<br/>
		Nor all her barking cannon, her deluge<br/>
		Of bullets, nor her horsehooves, nor her lance,<br/>
		Her boundless wealth, her bayonets aglance.<br/>
		You met her on her hills and overthrew,<br/>
		You crossed her by her streams and smote and slew.<br/>
		But soon in anger like the Ocean foiled<br/>
		For fiercer swift invasion she recoiled<br/>
		And multiplied her force until her troops<br/>
		Tenfold outnumbering your warlike groups<br/>
		Resurging rolled you back and seized your towns<br/>
		And spread like locusts over fields and downs.<br/>
		Not even then were you dismayed, not then<br/>
		Would tamely yield, but with a proud disdain<br/>
		Rejected proffered servitude and base.<br/>
		Therefore are you participants in praise</p>

		Your rugged pastoral mood disguise the man<br/>
		Identical at Salamis who waged<br/>
		Unequal battle and in salt floods assuaged<br/>
		The Persian’s lust of rule.
		Miltiades<br/>
		Is grown your brother; the strong Tyrolese<br/>
		Hold out their hands to you across the grave.<br/>
		From Rouen’s burning pile one watches; brave<br/>
		Hofer from sad Verona; in eastern skies<br/>
		Mewar’s unconquerable Rajpoots rise.<br/>
		They too preferred strong liberty and rude<br/>
		To a splendid ignominy of servitude.<br/>
		For liberty they gave to alien hands<br/>
		Their faery city and their fertile lands,<br/>
		Themselves to death, their women to the flame,<br/>
		And in wild woods and mountains harbouring came<br/>
		Often like sudden fire upon the foe:<br/>
		So for long decades fought, exile and woe<br/>
		Accepting, till the equal hand of God<br/>
		Restored to their hereditary abode.<br/>
		You too have greatly dared, and but that Fate<br/>
		For her remoter objects obdurate<br/>
		Averted her unmoved and marble gaze,<br/>

		From Earth’s free peoples.
		Not the armèd pride<br/>
		Of England but decrees supreme o’erride<br/>
		This stubborn nation.
		Farm and smiling field<br/>
		Plundered and burned no more your sustenance yield,<br/>
		Your chiefs are taken one by one, your bands<br/>
		Wasted with battle, your great war-weary hands<br/>
		Avail no longer and your women die<br/>
		In England’s camps by famine miserably,<br/>
		Disease and famine, hunger’s squalid brood.<br/>
		The smiling babes who should prolong your blood,<br/>
		Pale victims flit, to death’s unbottomed maw</p>

		Look not towards Europe!
		Europe’s heart is dead.<br/>
		Hard atheisms, selfish lusts instead<br/>
		Usurp her bosom; not honest blood but gold<br/>
		Runs liquid in her veins: for she has sold<br/>
		Her soul to commerce, Mammon is her creed,<br/>
		The ledger lined her Bible, and Christ must bleed<br/>
		In plundered nations that the modern Jew<br/>
		May prosper.
		This is not Europe that you knew<br/>
		When from the clash of mighty States you went<br/>

		For all her swift and sovran moods of old<br/>
		Are changed into a reckoning spirit cold<br/>
		And a hysteric wrath that dare not strike<br/>
		The strong man armed to meet the blow.
		She, like<br/>
		A trembling woman who puts o’er her shift<br/>
		Hard armour, wears the sword she dare not lift,<br/>
		Covering her coward heart with splendid arms:<br/>
		Clothed as in adamant shakes with pale alarms,<br/>
		Armed as with hell-fire fronts not answering shells,<br/>
		Blusters and trembles, menaces and pales.<br/>
		Therefore her navies case in triple steel,<br/>
		Therefore her legions grow apace; her heel<br/>
		Of iron breaks the weak ones of the world,<br/>
		But not against the strong her flags unfurled<br/>
		Shall flaunt the tempest, nor her hissing flail<br/>
		Of bullets thresh familiar hills and hail<br/>
		Of shells in Ocean sibilant be drowned<br/>
		While navies rend and sink her coasts around.<br/>
		Easier the naked African to quell<br/>
		Or on the ill-armed Mongolian shot and shell<br/>
		To lavish and with coward murder chase<br/>
		Or with strong lust invade a virtuous race.<br/>

		Small is the blade and narrow to the eye<br/>

		And through it the world-shaking thunders roar<br/>
		And from the storm the sweet fresh day have birth.<br/>

		Dawn stepped forth with a smile on her lips, and the glory of morning<br/>
		Hovered over the hills; then sweet<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="135" href="#">1</a> grew air with the

		Sweet and keen as a wild swift virgin; the wind walked blithely,<br/>

		Down from the northlands crowding,<br/>
		Touching the steps of the ghauts with the silver tips of their fingers<br/>
		Lightly the waters ran and talked to each other of sunshine,<br/>
		Lightly they laughed.
		But high on his stake impaled by the roadway<br/>
		Hung Mandavya the mighty in marble deep meditation,<br/>
		Sepulchred, dumb; on his either side were the thieves, immobile.<br/>
		They were dead, made free from cruelty, ceasing from anguish,<br/>
		And forgetting the thirst.
		But past them Ganges the mighty,<br/>
		First of the streams of the earth, our Mother, remembering the ages,<br/>

		Early at dawn by her ghauts the women of Mithila gathered.<br/>
		There they filled their gurgling jars, or gilding the Ganges<br/>
		Bathed in her waters and laughed as they bathed there clamouring, dashing<br/>
		Dew of her coolness in eyes of each other: the banks called sweetly<br/>
		Mad with the musical laughter of girls and joy of their crying,<br/>
		Low melodious cries.
		As when in a wood on the hillsides<br/>

		Filling the ear with sweetness carry from treetop to treetop<br/>
		Vermeil of crest and scarlet of tail and small brown bodies<br/>
		Flitting and calling, calling and flitting, full of sweet clamour,<br/>

		Golden-limbed<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="137" href="#">3</a> or white or darker than olives when ripest,<br/>
		Lovely of face or of mood, but all sweethearted and happy<br/>
		Aryan women.
		One there seemed of another moulding<br/>
		Who was aloof from the crowd and the chaos of cheerful faces.<br/>
		She at one side of the stairway slowly like one half-musing<br/>

		Nothing, nothing like that is in the wind.<br/>
		Ah no! what has not Britain done for us?<br/>
		Were we not savage, naked, barbarous?<br/>
		Has she not snatched and raised us from the mire?<br/>
		Taught us to dress, eat, talk, write, sneeze, perspire,<br/>
		Like Europeans, giving civilisation<br/>
		To this poor ignorant degraded nation?<br/>
		Was not our India full of cuts and knocks?<br/>
		’Twas Britain saved us from those hideous shocks.<br/>
		No matter if our poor of hunger die,<br/>
		Us she gave peace and ease and property.<br/>
		Were’t not for Clive, Dalhousie<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="143" href="#">1</a>, Curzon, all,<br/>

		Why do they join in a mystic line with those on the sands linking hands in strange and stately dances?<br/>
		Thou in the air, with a flame in thy hair, the whirl of thy wonders watching,<br/>
		Holdest the night in thy ancient right, mother divine, hyacinthine, with a girdle of beauty defended.<br/>
		Sworded with fire, attracting desire, thy tenebrous kingdom thou keepest,<br/>
		Starry-sweet, with the moon at thy feet, now hidden now seen the clouds between in the gloom and the drift of

<p class="P" search_id="CP-591">A noon of Deccan with its tyrant glare<br/>
		Oppressed the earth; the hills stood deep in haze,<br/>
		And sweltering athirst the fields glared up<br/>
		Longing for water in the courses parched<br/>
		Of streams long dead.
		Nature and man alike,<br/>
		Imprisoned by a bronze and brilliant sky,<br/>
		Sought an escape from that wide trance of heat.<br/>
		Nor only on inanimate hills and trees,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="168" href="#">1</a><br/>
		Nor on rare herdsman or the patient<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="169" href="#">2</a> hind<br/>
		Tilling the earth or tending sleeplessly<br/>
		The well-eared grain that burden fell.
		It hung<br/>
		Upon the Mogul horsemen as they rode<br/>
		With lances at the charge, the surf of steel<br/>
		About them and behind, as they recoiled<br/>
		Or circled, where the footmen ran and fired,<br/>
		And fired again and ran; “For now at last,”<br/>
		They deemed, “the war is over, now at last<br/>
		The panther of the hills is beaten back<br/>
		Right to his lair, the rebel crew to death<br/>
		Is hunted, and an end is made at last.”<br/>
		Therefore they stayed not for the choking dust,<br/>
		The slaying heat, the thirst of wounds and fight,<br/>
		The stumbling stark fatigue, but onward pressed<br/>
		With glowing eyes.
		Far otherwise the foe,<br/>
		Panting and sore oppressed and racked with thirst<br/>
		And blinded with the blazing earth who reeled<br/>
		Backward to Raigurh, moistening with their blood<br/>
		Their mother, and felt their own beloved hills<br/>
		A nightmare hell of death and heat, the sky<br/>
		A mute and smiling witness of their dire<br/>
		Anguish,– abandoned now of God and man,<br/>
		Who for their country and their race had striven,–<br/>
		In vain, it seemed.
		At morning when the sun</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 296</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-592">Was yet below the verge, the Bhonsle sprang<br/>
		At a high mountain fortress, hoping so<br/>
		To clutch the whole wide land into his grasp;<br/>
		But from the North and East the Moguls poured,<br/>
		Swords numberless and hooves that shook the hills<br/>
		And barking of a hundred guns.
		These bore<br/>
		The hero backward.
		Silently with set<br/>
		And quiet faces grim drew fighting back<br/>
		The strong Mahrattas to their hills; only<br/>
		Their rear sometimes with shouted slogan leaped<br/>
		At the pursuer’s throat, or on some rise<br/>
		Or covered vantage stayed the Mogul flood<br/>
		A moment.
		Ever foremost where men fought,<br/>
		Was Baji Prabhou seen, like a wild wave<br/>
		Of onset or a cliff against the surge.<br/>
		At last they reached a tiger-throated gorge<br/>
		Upon the way to Raigurh.
		Narrowing there<br/>
		The hills draw close, and their forbidding cliffs<br/>
		Threaten the prone incline.
		The Bhonsle paused,<br/>
		His fiery glance travelled in one swift gyre<br/>
		Hill, gorge and valley and with speed returned<br/>
		Mightily like an eagle on the wing<br/>
		To a dark youth beside him, Malsure<br/>
		The younger, with his bright and burning eyes,<br/>
		Who wordless rode quivering, as on the leash;<br/>
		His fierce heart hungered for the rear, where Death<br/>
		Was singing mid the laughter of the swords.<br/>
		“Ride, Suryaji,” the Chieftain cried, his look<br/>
		Inward, intent, “and swiftly from the rear<br/>
		Summon the Prabhou.”
		Turning at the word<br/>
		Suryaji’s hooves sped down the rock-strewn slope<br/>
		Into the trenchant valley’s depth<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="170" href="#">3</a>.
		Swiftly,<br/>
		Though burdened with a nation’s fate, the ridge<br/>
		They reached, where in stern silence fought and fell,<br/>
		Their iron hearts broken with desperate toil,<br/>
		The Southron rear, and to the Prabhou gave<br/>
		The summons of the Chief: “Ride, Baji, ride,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 297</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-593">The Bhonsle names thee, Baji.”
		And Baji spoke<br/>
		No word, but stormed with loose and streaming rein<br/>
		To the high frowning gorge and silent paused<br/>
		Before the leader.
		“Baji, more than once<br/>
		In battle thou hast stood, a living shield,<br/>
		Between me and the foe.
		But more today,<br/>
		O Baji, save than any single life,–<br/>
		Thy nation’s destiny.
		Thou seest this gorge<br/>
		Narrow and fell and gleaming like the throat<br/>
		Of some huge tiger, with its rocky fangs<br/>
		Agrin for food: and though the lower slope<br/>
		Descends too gently, yet with roots and stones<br/>
		It is hampered, and the higher prone descent<br/>
		Impregnably forbids assault; too steep<br/>
		The sides for any to ascend and shoot<br/>
		From vantage.
		Here might lion-hearted men,<br/>
		Though few, delay a host.
		Baji, I speed<br/>
		To Raigurh and in two brief hours return.<br/>
		Say with what force thy iron heart can hold<br/>
		The passage till I come.
		Thou seest our strength,<br/>
		How it has melted like the Afghan’s ice<br/>
		Into a pool of blood.”
		And while he paused<br/>
		Who had been chosen, spoke an iron man<br/>
		With iron brows who rode behind the Chief,<br/>
		Tanaji Malsure, that living sword:<br/>
		“Not for this little purpose was there need<br/>
		To call the Prabhou from his toil.
		Enough,<br/>
		Give me five hundred men; I hold the pass<br/>
		Till thy return.”
		But Shivaji kept still<br/>
		His great and tranquil look upon the face<br/>
		Of Baji Prabhou.
		Then, all black with wrath,<br/>
		Wrinkling his fierce hard eyes, the Malsure:<br/>
		“What ponders then the hero?
		Such a man<br/>
		Of men, he needs not like us petty swords<br/>
		A force behind him, but alone will hold<br/>
		All Rajasthan and Agra and Cabool<br/>
		From rise to set.”
		And Baji answered him:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 298</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-594">“Tanaji Malsure, not in this living net<br/>
		Of flesh and nerve, nor in the flickering mind<br/>
		Is a man’s manhood seated.
		God within<br/>
		Rules us, who in the Brahmin and the dog<br/>
		Can, if He will, show equal godhead.
		Not<br/>
		By men is mightiness achieved; Baji<br/>
		Or Malsure is but a name, a robe,<br/>
		And covers One alone.
		We but employ<br/>
		Bhavani’s strength, who in an arm of flesh<br/>
		Is mighty as in the thunder and the storm.<br/>
		I ask for fifty swords.”
		And Malsure:<br/>
		“Well, Baji, I will build thee such a pyre<br/>
		As man had never yet, when we return;<br/>
		For all the Deccan brightening shall cry out,<br/>
		Baji the Prabhou burns!”
		And with a smile<br/>
		The Prabhou answered: “Me thou shalt not burn.<br/>
		For this five feet or more of bone and flesh,<br/>
		Whether pure flame or jackals of the hills<br/>
		Be fattened with its rags, may well concern<br/>
		Others, not Baji Prabhou.”
		And the Chief<br/>
		With a high calmness in his shining look,<br/>
		“We part, O friend, but meet again we must,<br/>
		When from our tasks released we both shall run<br/>
		Like children to our Mother’s clasp.”
		He took<br/>
		From his wide brow the princely turban sown<br/>
		With aigrette diamond-crowned and on the head<br/>
		Of Baji set the gleaming sign, then clasped<br/>
		His friend and, followed by the streaming host<br/>
		That gathered from the rear, to farther hills<br/>
		Rode clattering.
		By the Mogul van approached<br/>
		Baji and his Mahrattas sole remained<br/>
		Watched by the mountains in the silent gorge.</p><br/>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-595">
		Small respite had the slender band who held<br/>
		Fate constant with that brittle hoop of steel;<br/>
		For like the crest of an arriving wave<br/>
		The Moslem van appeared, though slow and tired,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 299</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-596">Yet resolute to break such barrier faint,<br/>
		And forced themselves to run: – nor long availed;<br/>
		For with a single cry the muskets spoke,<br/>
		Once and again and always, as they neared,<br/>
		And, like a wave arrested, for a while<br/>
		The assailants paused and like a wave collapsed<br/>
		Spent backward in a cloud of broken spray,<br/>
		Retreating.
		Yielding up, the dangerous gorge<br/>
		Saw only on the gnarled and stumbling rise<br/>
		The dead and wounded heaped.
		But from the rear<br/>
		The main tremendous onset of the North<br/>
		Came in a dark and undulating surge<br/>
		Regardless of the check,– a mingled mass,<br/>
		Pathan and Mogul and the Rajput clans,<br/>
		All clamorous with the brazen throats of war<br/>
		And spitting smoke and fire.
		The bullets rang<br/>
		Upon the rocks, but in their place unhurt,<br/>
		Sheltered by tree and rock, the silent grim<br/>
		Defenders waited, till on root and stone<br/>
		The confident high-voiced triumphant surge<br/>
		Began to break, to stumble, then to pause,<br/>
		Confusion in its narrowed front.
		At once<br/>
		The muskets clamoured out, the bullets sped,<br/>
		Deadly though few; again and yet again,<br/>
		And some of the impetuous faltered back<br/>
		And some in wrath pressed on; and while they swayed<br/>
		Poised between flight and onset, blast on blast<br/>
		The volleyed death invisible hailed in<br/>
		Upon uncertain ranks.
		The leaders fell,<br/>
		The forward by the bullets chosen out,<br/>
		Prone or supine or leaning like sick men<br/>
		O’er trees and rocks, distressed the whole advance<br/>
		With prohibition by the silent slain.<br/>
		So the great onset failed.
		And now withdrawn<br/>
		The generals consulted, and at last<br/>
		In slow and ordered ranks the foot came on,<br/>
		An iron resolution in their tread,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 300</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-597">Hushed and deliberate.
		Far in the van,<br/>
		Tall and large-limbed, a formidable array,<br/>
		The Pathan infantry; a chosen force,<br/>
		Lower in crest, strong-framed, the Rajputs marched;<br/>
		The chivalry of Agra led the rear.<br/>
		Then Baji first broke silence, “Lo, the surge!<br/>
		That was but spray of death we first repelled.<br/>
		Chosen of Shivaji, Bhavani’s swords,<br/>
		For you the gods prepare.
		We die indeed,<br/>
		But let us die with the high-voiced assent<br/>
		Of Heaven to our country’s claim enforced<br/>
		To freedom.”
		As he spoke, the Mogul lines<br/>
		Entered the menacing wide-throated gorge,<br/>
		Carefully walking, but not long that care<br/>
		Endured, for where they entered, there they fell.<br/>
		Others behind in silence stern advanced.<br/>
		They came, they died; still on the previous dead<br/>
		New dead fell thickening.
		Yet by paces slow<br/>
		The lines advanced with labour infinite<br/>
		And merciless expense of valiant men.<br/>
		For even as the slopes were filled and held,<br/>
		Still the velocity and lethal range<br/>
		Increased of the Mahratta bullets; dead<br/>
		Rather than living held the conquered slope,–<br/>
		The living who, half-broken, paused.
		Abridged,<br/>
		Yet wide, the interval opposed advance,<br/>
		Daunting those resolute natures; eyes once bold<br/>
		With gloomy hesitation reckoned up<br/>
		The dread equivalent in human lives<br/>
		Of cubits and of yards, and hardly hoped<br/>
		One could survive the endless unacquired<br/>
		Country between.
		But from the Southron wall<br/>
		The muskets did not hesitate, but urged<br/>
		Refusal stern; the bullets did not pause,<br/>
		Nor calculate expense.
		Active they thronged<br/>
		Humming like bees and stung strong lives to death<br/>
		Making a holiday of carnage.
		Then</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 301</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-598">The heads that planned pushed swiftly to the front<br/>
		The centre yet unhurt, where Rajasthan,<br/>
		Playmate of death, had sent her hero sons.<br/>
		They with a rapid royal reckless pace<br/>
		Came striding over the perilous fire-swept ground,<br/>
		Nor answered uselessly the bullets thick<br/>
		Nor paused to judge, but o’er the increasing dead<br/>
		Leaping and striding, shouting, sword in hand,<br/>
		Rushed onward with immortal courage high<br/>
		In mortal forms, and held the lower slope.<br/>
		But now the higher incline, short but steep,<br/>
		Baffled their speed, and as they clambered up,<br/>
		Compact and fiery, like the rapid breath<br/>
		Of Agra’s hot simoom, the sheeted flame<br/>
		Belched bullets.
		Down they fell with huge collapse,<br/>
		And, rolling, with their shock drove back the few<br/>
		Who still attempted.
		Banned advance, retreat<br/>
		Threatening disgrace and slaughter, for a while<br/>
		Like a bound sacrifice the Rajputs stood<br/>
		Diminishing each moment.
		Then a lord<br/>
		High-crested of the Rathore clan stood out<br/>
		From the perplexed assailants, with his sword<br/>
		Beckoning the thousands on against the few.<br/>
		And him the bullets could not touch; he stood<br/>
		Defended for a moment by his lease<br/>
		Not yet exhausted.
		And a mighty shout<br/>
		Rose from behind, and in a violent flood<br/>
		The Rajputs flung themselves on the incline<br/>
		Like clambering lions.
		Many hands received<br/>
		The dead as they descended, flinging back<br/>
		Those mournful obstacles, and with a rush<br/>
		The lead surmounted and on level ground<br/>
		Stood sword in hand; yet only for a while,–<br/>
		For grim and straight the slogan of the South<br/>
		Leaped with the fifty swords to thrust them back,<br/>
		Baji the Prabhou leading.
		Thrice they came,<br/>
		Three times prevailed, three times the Southron charge</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 302</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-599">Repelled them; till at last the Rathore lord,<br/>
		As one appointed, led the advancing death,<br/>
		Nor waited to assure his desperate hold,<br/>
		But hurled himself on Baji; those behind<br/>
		Bore forward those in front.
		From right and left<br/>
		Mahratta muskets rang their music out<br/>
		And withered the attack that, still dissolved,<br/>
		Still formed again from the insistent rear<br/>
		And would not end.
		So was the fatal gorge<br/>
		Filled with the clamour of the close-locked fight.<br/>
		Sword rang on sword, the slogan shout, the cry<br/>
		Of guns, the hiss of bullets filled the air,<br/>
		And murderous strife heaped up the scanty space,<br/>
		Rajput and strong Mahratta breathing hard<br/>
		In desperate battle.
		But far off the hosts<br/>
		Of Agra stood arrested, confident,<br/>
		Waiting the end.
		Far otherwise it came<br/>
		Than they expected.
		For, as in the front<br/>
		The Rathore stood on the disputed verge<br/>
		And ever threw fresh strength into the scale<br/>
		With that inspiring gesture, Baji came<br/>
		Towards him singling out the lofty crest,<br/>
		The princely form: and, as the waves divide<br/>
		Before a driving keel, the battle so<br/>
		Before him parted, till he neared, he slew.<br/>
		Avoiding sword, avoiding lifted arm<br/>
		The blade surprised the Rajput’s throat, and down<br/>
		As falls an upright poplar, with his hands<br/>
		Outspread, dying, he clutched Mahratta ground.<br/>
		Loud rose the slogan as he fell.
		Amazed,<br/>
		The eager hosts of Agra saw reel back<br/>
		The Rajput battle, desperate victory<br/>
		Turned suddenly into entire defeat,<br/>
		Not headlong, but with strong discouragement,<br/>
		Sullen, convinced, rejecting the emprise.<br/>
		As they retired, the brilliant Pathan van<br/>
		Assumed the attempt.
		“Exhaust,” the generals cried,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 303</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-600">“Exhaust the stubborn mountaineers; for now<br/>
		Fatigued with difficult effort and success<br/>
		They hardly stand, weary, unstrung, inert.<br/>
		Scatter this fringe, and we march on and seize<br/>
		Raigurh and Shivaji.”
		Meanwhile, they too<br/>
		Not idle, covered by the rocks and trees,<br/>
		Straining for vantage, pausing on each ledge,<br/>
		Seizing each bush, each jutting promontory,<br/>
		Some iron muscles, climbing, of the south<br/>
		Lurked on the gorge’s gloomy walls unseen.<br/>
		On came the Pathans running rapidly,<br/>
		But as the nearmost left the rocky curve<br/>
		Where lurked the ambush, loud from stone and tree<br/>
		The silence spoke; sideways, in front, behind<br/>
		Death clamoured, and tall figures strewed the ground<br/>
		Like trees in a cyclone.
		Appalled the rest<br/>
		Broke this way and broke that, and some cried, “On!”<br/>
		Some shouted, “Back!” for those who led, fell fast.<br/>
		So the advance dissolved, divided,– the more<br/>
		In haste towards the plains, greeted with death<br/>
		Even while they ran; but others forward, full<br/>
		Of panic courage, drove towards the foe<br/>
		They could not reach,– so hot a blast and fell<br/>
		Stayed their unsteady valour, their retreat<br/>
		So swift and obstinate a question galled,<br/>
		Few through the hail survived.
		With gloom their chiefs<br/>
		Beheld the rout and drawing back their hosts<br/>
		In dubious council met, whether to leave<br/>
		That gorge of slaughter unredeemed or yet<br/>
		Demand the price of so immense a loss.</p>
<br/>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-601">But to the Prabhou came with anxious eyes<br/>
		The Captain of the band.
		“Baji,” he cried,<br/>
		“The bullets fail; all the great store we had<br/>
		Of shot and powder by unsparing use<br/>
		Is spent, is ended.”
		And Baji Prabhou turned.<br/>
		One look he cast upon the fallen men</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 304</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-602">Discernible by their attire, and saw<br/>
		His ranks not greatly thinned, one look below<br/>
		Upon the hundreds strewing thick the gorge,<br/>
		And grimly smiled; then where the sun in fire<br/>
		Descending stooped, towards the vesper verge<br/>
		He gazed and cried: “Make iron of your souls.<br/>
		Yet if Bhavani wills, strength and the sword<br/>
		Can stay our nation’s future from o’erthrow<br/>
		Till victory with Shivaji return.”<br/>
		And so they waited without word or sound,<br/>
		And over them the silent afternoon<br/>
		Waited; the hush terrestrial was profound.<br/>
		Except the mountains and the fallen men<br/>
		No sight, no voice, no movement was abroad,<br/>
		Only a few black-winged slow-circling birds<br/>
		That wandered in the sky, only the wind<br/>
		That now arose and almost noiselessly<br/>
		Questioned the silence of the wooded sides,<br/>
		Only the occasional groan that marked the pang<br/>
		By some departing spirit on its frame<br/>
		Inflicted.
		And from time to time the gaze<br/>
		Of Baji sought the ever-sinking sun.<br/>
		Men fixed their eyes on him and in his firm<br/>
		Expression lived.
		So the slow minutes passed.<br/>
		But when the sun dipped very low, a stir<br/>
		Was felt far off, and all men grasped the hilt<br/>
		Tighter and put a strain upon their hearts.<br/>
		Resolved at last the stream of Mogul war<br/>
		Came once more pouring, not the broken rout<br/>
		Of Pathans, not discouraged Rajput swords,<br/>
		But Agra’s chivalry glancing with gold<br/>
		And scimitars inlaid and coloured robes.<br/>
		Swiftly they came expecting the assault<br/>
		Fire-winged of bullets and the lethal rain,<br/>
		But silence met them and to their intent<br/>
		So ominous it seemed, awhile they paused,<br/>
		Fearing some ruse, though for much death prepared,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 305</p>

		And Baji knew the goddess formidable<br/>

		He spoke and shouted high the slogan loud.<br/>
		Desperate, he laboured in his human strength<br/>
		To push the Mogul from the gorge’s end<br/>
		With slow compulsion.
		By his side fell fast<br/>
		Mahratta and Mogul and on his limbs<br/>
		The swords drank blood, a single redness grew<br/>
		His body, yet he fought.
		Then at his side<br/>
		Ghastly with wounds and in his fiery eyes<br/>

		And Baji with a gruesome hand<br/>
		Wiping the blood from his fierce staring eyes<br/>
		Saw round him only fifteen men erect<br/>
		Of all his fifty.
		But in front, behind,<br/>
		On either side the Mogul held the gorge.<br/>
		Groaning, once more the grim Mahratta turned<br/>
		And like a bull with lowered horns that runs,<br/>
		Charged the exultant foe behind.
		With him<br/>
		The desperate survivors hacking ran,<br/>
		And as a knife cuts instantly its way<br/>
		Through water, so the yielding Mogul wall<br/>

		There where hardly three abreast<br/>

		And from this latest hold Baji beheld<br/>
		Mounting the farther incline, rank on rank,<br/>
		A mass of horsemen; galloped far in front<br/>
		Some forty horse, and on a turbaned head<br/>
		Bright in the glory of the sinking sun<br/>
		A jewelled aigrette blazed.
		And Baji looked<br/>
		Over the wide and yawning field of space<br/>
		And seemed to see a fort upon a ridge,<br/>
		Raigurh; then turned and sought again the war.<br/>
		So for few minutes desperately they strove.<br/>
		Man after man of the Mahrattas fell<br/>

		The horse-hooves rang and, as the latest left<br/>

		And one who looks out from the happy, warm<br/>
		And mortal limit of mankind that live<br/>

		Looks down on me in flame.

		I rose<br/>
		From birth to birth, until I reached the peak<br/>
		Of human knowledge.
		Then in Bharat born<br/>
		I, Kuthumi, the Kshatriya, the adept,<br/>
		The mighty Yogin of Dwaipayan’s school,<br/>
		To Vyása<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="205" href="#">3</a> came, the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="206" href="#">4</a>

		I went into the mountains by the sea<br/>

		And sung to by that rude relentless sound,<br/>
		Amid<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="211" href="#">9</a> the cries of beasts, the howl of winds,<br/>
		Surrounded by the gnashing demon hordes,<br/>
		I did the Hathayoga in three days,<br/>

		Fulfilled, Hiranyakashipu performed,<br/>
		The Yoga of the old Lemurian Kings.<br/>
		I felt the strength of Titans in my veins,<br/>
		The joy of gods, the pride of Siddhas.
		Tall<br/>
		And mighty like a striding God I came<br/>
		To Vyása<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="215" href="#">13</a>; but he shook his dense piled locks,<br/>
		Denying me.
		“Thou art not pure,” he cried.<br/>
		I went in anger to Himaloy’s peaks,<br/>

		Bali the Titan learned and gave to men,<br/>
		The Yoga of the old Atlantic Kings.<br/>
		I came to Vyása<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="219" href="#">17</a>, shining like a sun.<br/>

		Then art thou from thy mighty work released<br/>
		Into the worlds of bliss for endless years<br/>
		To rest, until another aeon comes,<br/>
		When of the seven Rishis thou art one.”<br/>
		I sent my knowledge forth across the land;<br/>

		In quiet asrams, nor in temples pure,<br/>
		Nor where the wealthy traffickers resort;<br/>
		Brahmin nor Kshatriya body housed the Lord,<br/>
		Vaishya<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="225" href="#">23</a> nor Sudra nor outcaste.
		At length<br/>
		To a bare hut on a wild mountain’s verge<br/>
		Led by the star I came.
		A hermit mad<br/>
		Of the wild Abhirs, who sat dumb<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="226" href="#">24</a> or laughed,<br/>
		And ran and leaped and danced upon the hills,<br/>
		But told the reason of his joy to none,–<br/>

		And smote me with his foot, and out of me<br/>
		All knowledge, all desire, all strength was gone<br/>
		Into its Source.
		I sat, an infant child.<br/>
		He laughed aloud and said, “Take back thy gifts,<br/>
		O beggar!” and went leaping down the slope.<br/>
		Then full of light and strength and bliss I soared<br/>
		Beyond the spheres, above the mighty gods,<br/>
		And left my human body on the snows;<br/>
		And others gathered to me, more or less<br/>
		In puissance, to assist, but mine the charge<br/>
		By Vishnu given.
		I gather knowledge here,<br/>
		Then to my human frame awhile descend<br/>
		And walk mid men, choosing my instruments,<br/>
		Testing, rejecting and confirming souls,<br/>
		Vessels of the Spirit; for the golden age<br/>
		In Kali comes, the iron lined with gold.<br/>
		The Yoga shall be given back to men,<br/>
		The sects shall cease, the grim debates die out,<br/>
		And Atheism perish from the earth<br/>
		Blasted with knowledge, love and brotherhood<br/>

		Swiftly when Life fleets, invisibly changing the arc of the soul-drift,<br/>
		And, with the choice that has chanced or the fate man has called and now suffers<br/>
		Weighted, the moment travels driving the past towards the future,<br/>
		Only its face and its feet are seen, not the burden it carries.<br/>
		Weight of the event and its surface we bear, but the meaning is hidden.<br/>
		Earth sees not; life’s clamour deafens the ear of the spirit:<br/>
		Man knows not; least knows the messenger chosen for the summons.<br/>
		Only he listens to the voice of his thoughts, his heart’s ignorant whisper,<br/>
		Whistle of winds in the tree-tops of Time and the rustle of Nature.<br/>
		Now too the messenger hastened driving the car of the errand:<br/>
		Even while dawn was a gleam in the east, he had cried to his coursers.<br/>
		Half yet awake in light’s turrets started the scouts of the morning<br/>
		Hearing the jar of the wheels and the throb of the hooves’ exultation,<br/>
		Hooves of the horses of Greece as they galloped to Phrygian Troya.<br/>
		Proudly they trampled through Xanthus thwarting the foam of his anger,<br/>
		Whinnying high as in scorn crossed Simois’ tangled currents,<br/>
		Xanthus’ reed-girdled twin, the gentle and sluggard river.<br/>
		One and unarmed in the car was the driver; grey was he, shrunken,<br/>
		Worn with his decades.
		To Pergama cinctured with strength Cyclopean<br/>
		Old and alone he arrived, insignificant, feeblest of mortals,<br/>
		Carrying Fate in his helpless hands and the doom of an empire.<br/>
		Ilion, couchant, saw him arrive from the sea and the darkness.<br/>
		Heard mid the faint slow stirrings of life in the sleep of the city,<br/>
		Rapid there neared a running of feet, and the cry of the summons<br/>
		Beat round the doors that guarded the domes of the splendour of Priam.</p>

		Each from his starry couch, and they labour.
		Doom, we can see it,<br/>

		High was the Argive’s answer confronting the mighty in Troya.<br/>
		“Princes of Pergama, whelps of the lion who roar for the mellay,<br/>
		Suffer my speech!
		It shall ring like a spear on the hearts of the mighty.<br/>
		Blame not the herald; his voice is an impulse, an echo, a channel<br/>

		I am his envoy, herald am I of the conquering Argives.<br/>
		Has not one heard in the night when the breezes whisper and shudder,<br/>

		For he prowls through the glens of the mountains,<br/>
		Errs a dangerous gleam in the woodlands, fatal and silent.<br/>

		Now not with Tydeus’ son, not now with Odysseus and Ajax<br/>
		Trample the gods in the sound of their chariot-wheels, victory leading:<br/>
		Argos falls red in her heaps to their scythes; they shelter the Trojans;<br/>
		Victory unleashed follows and fawns upon Penthesilea.<br/>
		Ponder no more, O Ilion, city of ancient Priam!<br/>
		Rise, O beloved of the gods, and go forth in thy strength to the battle.<br/>
		Not by the dreams of Laocoon strung to the faith that is febrile,<br/>
		Nor with the tremblings vain and the haunted thoughts of Antenor,<br/>
		But with a noble and serious strength and an obstinate valour<br/>
		Suffer the shock of your foes, O nation chosen by Heaven;<br/>
		Proudly determine on victory, live by disaster unshaken.<br/>
		Either Fate receive like men, nay, like gods, nay, like Trojans.”<br/>
		So like an army that streams and that marches, speeding and pausing,<br/>
		Drawing in horn and wing or widened for scouting and forage,<br/>
		Bridging the floods, avoiding the mountains, threading the valleys,<br/>
		Fast with their flashing panoply clad in gold and in iron</p>

		Lord of opinion, though by the aged frowned on and censured,<br/>
		But to this voice of their thoughts the young men vibrated wholly.<br/>
		Loud like a storm on the ocean mounted the roar of the people.<br/>
		“Cease from debate,” men cried, “arise, O thou warlike Aeneas!<br/>
		Speak for this nation, launch like a spear at the tents of the Hellene<br/>
		Ilion’s voice of war!”
		Then up mid a limitless shouting<br/>
		Stern and armed from his seat like a war-god helmèd Aeneas<br/>
		Rose by King Priam approved in this last of Ilion’s sessions,<br/>
		Holding the staff of the senate’s authority.
		“Silence, O commons,<br/>
		Hear and assent or refuse as your right is, masters of Troya,<br/>
		Ancient and sovereign people, act that your kings have determined<br/>
		Sitting in council high, their reply to the strength of Achilles.<br/>
		‘Son of the Aeacids, vain is thy offer; the pride of thy challenge<br/>
		Rather we choose; it is nearer to Dardanus, King of the Hellenes.<br/>
		Neither shall Helen be led back, the Tyndarid, weeping to Argos,<br/>
		Nor down the paths of peace revisit her fathers’ Eurotas.<br/>
		Death and the fire may prevail o’er us, never our wills shall surrender<br/>
		Lowering Priam’s heights and darkening Ilion’s splendours.<br/>
		Not of such sires were we born, but of kings and of gods, O Larissan.<br/>
		Not with her gold Troy traffics for safety<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="365" href="#">136</a>, but with her
		spear-points.<br/>
		Stand with thy oath in the war-front, Achilles; call on thy helpers<br/>
		Armed to descend from the calm of Olympian heights to thy succour<br/>
		Hedging thy fame from defeat; for we all desire thee in battle,<br/>
		Mighty to end thee or tame at last by the floods of the Xanthus.’
		”<br/>
		So Aeneas resonant spoke, stern, fronted like Ares,<br/>
		And with a voice that conquered the earth and invaded the heavens<br/>
		Loud they approved their doom and fulfilled their impulse immortal.<br/>
		Last Deiphobus rose in their meeting, head of their mellay:<br/>
		“Proudly and well have you answered, O nation beloved of Apollo;<br/>
		Fearless of death they must walk who would live and be mighty for ever.<br/>
		Now, for the sun is hastening up the empyrean azure,<br/>

		Ilion turned her thoughts in a proud expectancy seaward<br/>
		Waiting to hear the sounds that she loved and the cry of the mellay.<br/>
		Now to their citadel Priam’s sons returned with their father,<br/>
		Now from the gates Talthybius issued grey in his chariot;<br/>
		But in the halls of Anchises Aeneas not doffing his breastpiece<br/>
		Hastily ate of the corn of his country, cakes of the millet<br/>
		Doubled with wild-deer’s flesh, from the quiet hands of Creüsa.<br/>
		She, as he ate, with her calm eyes watching him smiled on her husband:<br/>
		“Ever thou hastest to battle, O warrior, ever thou fightest<br/>

		There, once heard, leaving all thou drivest, O stark in thy courage.<br/>
		Yet am I blest among women who tremble not, left in thy mansion,<br/>

		Sole with the shafts hissing round thee and say to my quivering spirit,<br/>
		‘Now he is striking at Ajax, now he has met Diomedes.’<br/>
		Such are the mighty twain who are ever near to protect thee,<br/>
		Phoebus, the Thunderer’s son, and thy mother, gold Aphrodite;<br/>
		Such are the Fates that demand thee, O destined head of the future.<br/>
		But though my thoughts for their own are not troubled, always, Aeneas,<br/>

		Who in this battle are losing their children and well-loved husbands,<br/>
		Brothers too dear, for the eyes that are wet, for the hearts that are silent.<br/>
		Will not this war then end that thunders for ever round Troya?”<br/>
		But to Creüsa the hero answered, the son of Anchises:<br/>
		“Surely the gods protect, yet is Death too always mighty.<br/>
		Most in his shadowy envy he strikes at the brave and the lovely,<br/>
		Grudging works to abridge their days and to widow the sunlight.<br/>
		Most, disappointed, he rages against the belovèd of Heaven;<br/>
		Striking their lives through their hearts he mows down their loves and their pleasures.<br/>
		Truly thou sayst<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="366" href="#">137</a>, thou needst<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="367" href="#">138</a> not to fear for my life in the battle;</p>

		“So may it be that I go before thee, seeing, Aeneas,<br/>
		Over my dying eyes thy lips bend down for the parting.<br/>
		Blissfullest end is this for a woman here mid earth’s sorrows;<br/>
		Afterwards there we hope that the hands shall join which were parted.”<br/>
		So she spoke, not knowing the gods: but Aeneas departing<br/>
		Clasped his father’s knees, the ancient mighty Anchises.<br/>
		“Bless me, my father; I go to the battle.
		Strong with thy blessing<br/>
		Even today may I hurl down Ajax, slay Diomedes,<br/>
		And on the morrow gaze on the empty beaches of Troas.”<br/>
		Troubled and joyless, nought replying to warlike Aeneas<br/>
		Long Anchises sat unmoving, silent, sombre,<br/>
		Gazing into his soul with eyes that were closed to the sunlight.<br/>
		“Prosper, Aeneas,” slowly he answered him, “son of a goddess,<br/>
		Prosper, Aeneas; and if for Troy some doom is preparing,<br/>
		Suffer always the will of the gods with a piety constant.<br/>
		Only they will what Necessity fashions compelled<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="368" href="#">139</a> by the

		Then<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="370" href="#">141</a> from the house of his fathers Aeneas rapidly striding<br/>
		Came to the city echoing now with the wheels of the chariots,<br/>
		Clanging with arms and astream with the warlike tramp of her thousands.<br/>
		Fast through the press he strode and men turning knew Aeneas,<br/>
		Greatened in heart and went on with loftier thoughts towards battle.<br/>
		He through the noise and the crowd to Antenor’s high-built mansion<br/>
		Striding came, and he turned to its courts and the bronze of its threshold<br/>
		Trod which had suffered the feet of so many princes departed.<br/>
		But as he crossed its brazen square from the hall there came running,<br/>
		Leaping up light to his feet and laughing with sudden pleasure,<br/>
		Eurus the youngest son of Polydamas.
		Clasping the fatal<br/>
		War-hardened hand with a palm that was smooth as a maiden’s or infant’s,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 391</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-679">“Well art thou come, Aeneas,” he said, “and good fortune has sent thee!<br/>
		Now I shall go to the field; thou wilt speak with my grandsire Antenor<br/>
		And he shall hear thee though chid by his heart reluctant.
		Rejoicing<br/>
		I shall go forth in thy car or warring by Penthesilea,<br/>
		Famous, give to her grasp the spear that shall smite down Achilles.”<br/>
		Smiling answered Aeneas, “Surely will, Eurus, thy prowess<br/>
		Carry thee far to the front; thou shalt fight with Epeus and slay him.<br/>
		Who shall say that this hand was not chosen to pierce Menelaus?<br/>
		But for a while with the ball<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="371" href="#">142</a> should it rather strive, O
		hero,<br/>
		Till in the play and the wrestle its softness is trained<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="372" href="#">143</a> for the
		smiting.”<br/>
		Eagerly Eurus answered, “But they have told me, Aeneas,<br/>
		This is the last of our fights; for today will Penthesilea<br/>
		Meet Achilles in battle and slay him ending the Argives.<br/>
		Then shall I never have mixed in this war that is famous for ever.<br/>
		What shall I say when my hairs are white like the aged Antenor’s?<br/>
		Men will ask, ‘And what were thy deeds in the warfare Titanic?<br/>
		Whom didst thou slay of the Argives, son of Polydamas, venging<br/>
		Bravely thy father?’ Then must I say, ‘I lurked in the city.<br/>
		I was too young and only ascending the Ilian ramparts<br/>
		Saw the return or the flight, but never the deed and the triumph.’<br/>
		Friend, if you<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="373" href="#">144</a> take me not forth, I shall die of grief ere the
		sunset.”<br/>
		Plucking the hand of Aeneas he drew him into the mansion<br/>
		Vast; and over the floor of the spacious hall they hastened<br/>
		Laughing, the gracious child and the mighty hero and statesman,<br/>
		Flower of a present stock and the burdened star of the future.<br/>
		Meanwhile girt by his sons and the sons of his sons in his chamber<br/>
		Cried<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="374" href="#">145</a> to the remnants left of his blood the aged Antenor.<br/>
		“Hearken you who are sprung from my loins and children, their offspring!<br/>
		None shall again go forth to the fight who is kin to Antenor.<br/>
		Weighed with my curse he shall go and the spear-points athirst of the Argives<br/>
		Meet him wroth; he shall die in his sin and his name be forgotten.<br/>
		Oft have I sent forth my blood to be spilled in vain in the battle<br/>
		Fighting for Troy and her greatness earned by my toil and my fathers’.<br/>
		Now all the debt has been paid; she rejects us driven by the immortals.<br/>
		Much do we owe to the mother who bore us, much to our country;<br/>
		But at the last our life is ours and the gods’ and the future’s.<br/>
		Gather the gold of my house and our kin, O ye sons of Antenor.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 392</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-680">Warned by a voice in my soul I will go forth tonight from this city<br/>

		Over God’s waters guided, treading the rage of Poseidon,<br/>
		Bellying out with their sails let them cleave to the untravelled distance<br/>
		Ocean’s crests and resign to their Fates the doomed and the evil.”<br/>
		So Antenor spoke and his children heard him in silence;<br/>
		Awed by his voice and the dread of his curse they obeyed, though in sorrow.<br/>
		Halamus only replied to his father: “Dire are the white hairs<br/>

		For I will sleep in the dust of Troy embracing her ashes,<br/>
		There where Polydamas sleeps and the many comrades I cherished.<br/>
		So let me go to the darkness remembered or wholly forgotten,<br/>
		Yet having fought for my country, true in my fall to my nation.”<br/>
		Then in his aged wrath to Halamus answered Antenor:<br/>
		“Go then and perish doomed with the doomed and the hated of heaven;<br/>
		Nor shall the gods forgive thee dying nor shall thy father.”<br/>
		Out from the chamber Halamus strode with grief in his bosom<br/>
		Wrestling with wrath and he went to his doom nor looked back at his dear ones.<br/>
		Crossing the hall the son of Antenor and son of Anchises<br/>
		Met in the paths of their fates where they knotted and crossed for the parting,<br/>
		One with the curse of the gods and his sire fast wending to Hades,<br/>
		Fortunate, blessed the other; yet equal their minds were and virtues.<br/>
		Cypris’ son to the Antenorid: “Thee I have sought and thy brothers,<br/>
		Bough of Antenor; sore is our need today of thy counsels,<br/>
		Endless our want of their arms that are strong and their hearts that recoil not<br/>
		Meeting myriads stark with the spear in unequal battle.”<br/>
		Halamus answered him: “I will go forth to the palace of Priam,<br/>
		There where Troy yet lives and far from the halls of my fathers;<br/>
		There will I speak, not here.
		For my kin they repose in the mansion<br/>
		Sitting unarmed in their halls while their brothers fall in the battle.”<br/>
		Eurus eagerly answered the hero: “Me rather, therefore,<br/>
		Take to the fight with you; I will make war on the Greeks for my uncles;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 393</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-681">One for all I will fill their place in the shock with the foemen.”<br/>
		But from his chamber-door Antenor heard and rebuked him:<br/>
		“Scamp of my heart, thou torment! in to<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="375" href="#">146</a> thy chamber and rest
		there,<br/>
		Bound with cords lest thou cease, thou flutter-brain, scourged into quiet;<br/>
		So shall thy lust of the fight be healed and our mansion grow tranquil.”<br/>
		Chid by the old man Eurus slunk from the hall discontented,<br/>
		Yet with a dubious smile like a moonbeam lighting his beauty.<br/>
		But to Antenor the Dardanid born from the white Aphrodite:<br/>
		“Late the Antenorids learn to flinch from the spears of the Argives,<br/>
		Even this boy of their blood has Polydamas’ heart and his valour.<br/>
		Nor should a life that was honoured and noble be stained in its ending.<br/>
		Nay, then, the mood of a child would shame a grey-headed wisdom,<br/>
		If for the fault of the people virtue and Troy were forgotten.<br/>
		For, though the people hear us not, yet are we bound to our nation:<br/>
		Over the people the gods are; over a man is his country;<br/>
		This is the deity first adored by the hearths of the noble.<br/>
		For by our nation’s will we are ruled in the home and the battle<br/>
		And for our nation’s weal we offer our lives and our children’s.<br/>
		Not by their own wills led nor their passions men rise to their manhood,<br/>
		Selfishly seeking their good, but the gods’ and the State’s and the fathers’.”<br/>
		Wroth Antenor replied to the warlike son of Anchises:<br/>
		“Great is the soul in thee housed and stern is thy will, O Aeneas;<br/>
		Onward it moves undismayed to its goal though a city be ruined.<br/>
		They too guide thee who deepest see of the ageless<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="376" href="#">147</a>
		immortals,<br/>
		One with her heart and one in his spirit, Cypris and Phoebus.<br/>
		Yet might a man not knowing this think as he watched thee, Aeneas,<br/>
		‘Spurring Priam’s race to its fall he endangers this city,<br/>
		Hoping to build a throne out of ruins sole in the Troad.’<br/>
		I too have gods who warn me and lead, Athene and Hera.<br/>
		Not as the ways of other mortals are theirs who are guided,<br/>
		They whose eyes are the gods and they walk by a light that is secret.”<br/>
		Coldly Aeneas made answer, stirred into wrath by the taunting:<br/>
		“High wert thou always, nurtured in wisdom, ancient Antenor.<br/>
		Walk then favoured and led, yet watch lest passion and evil<br/>
		Feign auguster names and mimic the gait of the deathless.”<br/>
		And with a smile on his lips but wrath in his bosom answered,<br/>
		Wisest of men but with wisdom of mortals, aged Antenor:</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 394</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-682">“Led or misled we are mortals and walk by a light that is given;<br/>
		Most they err who deem themselves most from error excluded.<br/>
		Nor shalt thou hear in this battle the shout of the men of my lineage<br/>
		Holding the Greeks as once and driving back Fate from their country.<br/>
		His alone will be heard for a space while the stern gods are patient<br/>
		Even now who went forth a victim self-offered to Hades,<br/>
		Last whom their wills have plucked from the fated house of Antenor.”<br/>

		car-wheels,<br/>
		Filled with a mightier rumour of war and the march of its thousands,<br/>
		Till at Troy’s upward curve he found the Antenorid crestward<br/>
		Mounting the steep incline that climbed to the palace of Priam<br/>
		White in her proud and armèd citadel.
		Silent, ascending<br/>
		Hardly their feet had attempted the hill when behind them they hearkened<br/>
		Sweet-tongued a call and the patter and hurry of light-running sandals,<br/>
		Turning they beheld with a flush on his cheeks and a light on his lashes<br/>
		Challenging mutely and pleading the boyish beauty of Eurus.<br/>
		“Racer to mischief,” said Halamus, “couldst thou not sit in thy chamber?<br/>
		Surely cords and the rod await thee, Eurus, returning.”<br/>
		Answered with laughter the child, “I have broken through ranks of the fighters,<br/>
		Dived under chariot-wheels to arrive here and I return not.<br/>
		I too for counsel of battle have come to the palace of Priam.”<br/>
		Burdened with thought they mounted slowly the road of their fathers<br/>
		Breasting the Ilian hill where Laomedon’s mansion was seated<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="379" href="#">150</a>,<br/>
		They from the crest down-gazing saw their country’s housetops<br/>
		Under their feet and heard the murmur of Troya below them.<br/>
		But in the palace of Priam coming and going of house-thralls<br/>
		Filled all the corridors; smoke from the kitchens curled in its plenty<br/>
		Rich with savour and breathed from the labouring lungs of Hephaestus.<br/>
		Far in the halls and the chambers voices travelled and clustered,<br/>
		Anklets jangling ran and sang back from doorway to doorway<br/>
		Mocking with music of speed and its laughters the haste of the happy,<br/>
		Sound came of arms, there was tread of the great, there were murmurs of women,–<br/>

		Never can Death undo what life has done for us, Paris.<br/>
		Nor, whatsoever<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="385" href="#">156</a> betide, can the hour be unlived of our
		rapture.<br/>
		This too is good that nations should meet in the shock of the battle,<br/>
		Heroes be slain and a theme be made for the songs of the poets,<br/>
		Songs that shall thrill with the name of Helen, the beauty of Paris.<br/>
		Well is this also that empires should fall for the eyes of a woman;<br/>
		Well that for Helen Hector ended, Memnon was slaughtered,<br/>
		Strong Sarpedon fell and Troilus ceased in his boyhood.<br/>
		Troy for Helen burning, her glory, her empire, her riches,<br/>
		This is the sign of the gods and the type of things that are mortal.<br/>
		Thou who art kin to the masters of heaven, unconstrained like thy kindred<br/>
		High on this ancient stage of the Troad with gods for spectators<br/>
		Play till the end thy part, O thou wondrous and beautiful actor:<br/>
		Fight and slay the Greeks, my countrymen; victor returning<br/>
		Take for reward of the play, thy delight of Argive Helen.<br/>
		Force from my bosom a hint of the joy denied to the death-claimed,<br/>
		Rob in the kiss of my lips a pang from the raptures of heaven.”<br/>
		Clasping him wholly her arms of desire were a girdle of madness,<br/>
		Cestus divine of the dread Aphrodite.
		He with her kisses<br/>
		Flushed like the gods with unearthly wine and rejoiced in his ruin.<br/>
		Thus while they conversed now in this hour that was near to their parting<br/>
		Last upon earth, a fleet-footed slavegirl came to the chamber:<br/>
		“Paris, thy father and mother desire thee; there in the strangers’<br/>
		Outer hall Aeneas and Halamus wait for thy coming.”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 398</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-686">So with the Argive he wended to Priam’s ample chamber<br/>
		Far in Laomedon’s house where Troy looked upwards to Ida.<br/>
		Priam and Hecuba there, the ancient grey-haired rulers,<br/>
		Waiting him sat in their chairs of ivory calm in their greatness;<br/>
		Hid in her robes at their feet lay Cassandra crouched from her visions.<br/>
		“Since, O my father,” said Paris, “thy thoughts have been with me, thy blessing<br/>
		Surely shall help me today in my strife with the strength of Achilles.<br/>
		Surely the gods shall obey in the end the might of our spirits,<br/>
		Pallas and Hera, flame-sandalled Artemis, Zeus and Apollo.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="386" href="#">157</a><br/>
		Ever serve the immortal brightnesses man when he stands up<br/>
		Firm with his will uplifted a steadfast flame towards the heavens,<br/>
		Ares works in his heart and Hephaestus burns in his labour.”<br/>
		Priam replied to his son: “Forewilled by the gods, Alexander,<br/>
		All things happen on earth and yet we must strive who are mortals,<br/>
		Knowing all vain, yet we strive; for our nature seizing us always<br/>
		Drives like the flock that is herded and urged towards shambles or pasture.<br/>
		So have the high gods<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="387" href="#">158</a> fashioned these tools of their action and
		pleasure;<br/>
		Failure and grief are their engines no less than the might of the victor;<br/>
		They in the blow descend and resist in the sobs of the smitten.<br/>
		Such are their goads that I too must walk in the paths that are common,<br/>
		Even I who know must send for thee, moved by Cassandra.<br/>
		Speak, O my child, since Apollo has willed it, once, and be silent.”<br/>
		But in her raiment hidden Cassandra answered her father:<br/>
		“No, for my heart has changed since I cried for him, vexed by Apollo.<br/>
		Why should I speak?
		For who will believe me in Troy? who believed me<br/>
		Ever in Troy or the world?
		Event and disaster approve me<br/>
		Only, my comrades, not men in their thoughts, not my brothers and kinsmen.<br/>
		All by their hopes are gladly deceived and grow wroth with the warner,<br/>
		Half-blind prophets of hope entertained by the gods in the mortal!<br/>
		Wiser blind, if nothing they saw or only the darkness.<br/>
		I too once hoped when Apollo pursued me with love in his temple.<br/>
		Round me already there gleamed the ray of the vision prophetic,<br/>
		Thrill of that rapture I felt and the joy of the god in his seeing<br/>
		Nor did I know that the knowledge of mortals is bound unto blindness.<br/>
		Either only they walk mid the coloured dreams of the senses<br/>
		Treading the greenness of earth and deeming the touch of things real,</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 399</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-687">Or if they see, by the curse of the gods their sight into falsehood<br/>
		Easily turns and leads them more stumbling astray than the sightless.<br/>
		So are we either blind in a darkness or dazzled by seeing.<br/>
		Thus have the gods protected their purpose and baffled the sages;<br/>
		Over the face of the Truth their shield of gold is extended.<br/>
		But I deemed otherwise, urged by the Dreadful One, he who sits always<br/>
		Veiled in us fighting the gods whom he uses.
		I cried to Apollo,<br/>
		‘Give me thy vision sheer, not such as thou giv’st to thy prophets,<br/>
		Troubled though luminous; clear be the vision and ruthless to error,<br/>
		Far-darting god who art veiled by the sun and by death thou art shielded.<br/>
		Then I shall know that thou lovest.’
		He gave, alarmed and reluctant,<br/>
		Driven by Fate and his heart; but I mocked him, I broke from my promise,<br/>
		Courage fatal helping my heart to its ruin with laughter.<br/>
		Always now I remember his face that grew tranquil and ruthless,<br/>
		Hear the voice divine and implacable: ‘Since thou deceivest<br/>
		Even the gods and thou hast not feared to lie to Apollo,<br/>
		Speak shalt thou henceforth only truth, but none shall believe thee:<br/>
		Scorned in thy words, rejected yet more for their bitter fulfilment,<br/>
		Scourged by the gods thou must speak though thy sick heart yearns to be silent.<br/>
		For in this play thou hast dared to play with the masters of heaven,<br/>
		Girl, it is thou who hast lost; thy voice is mine and thy bosom.’<br/>
		Since then all I foreknow; therefore anguish is mine for my portion:<br/>
		Since then all whom I love must perish slain by my loving.<br/>
		Even of that I denied him, violent force shall bereave me<br/>
		Grasped mid the flames of my city and shouts of her merciless victors.”<br/>
		But to Cassandra answered gently the voice of her brother:<br/>
		“Sister of mine, afflicted and seized by the dreadful Apollo,<br/>
		All whose eyes can pierce that curtain, gaze into dimness;<br/>
		This they have glimpsed and that they imagine deceived by their natures<br/>
		Seeing the forms in their hearts of dreadful things and of joyous;<br/>
		As in the darkness our eyes are deceived by shadows uncertain,<br/>
		Such is their sight who rend the veil that the dire gods have woven.<br/>
		Busy our hearts are weaving thoughts and images always:<br/>
		After their kind they see what here we call truth.
		So thy nature<br/>
		Tender and loving, plagued by this war and its fears<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="388" href="#">159</a> for thy
		loved ones,<br/>
		Sees calamity everywhere; when the event like the vision</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 400</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-688">Seems, as in every war the beloved must fall and the cherished,<br/>
		Then the heart cries, ‘It has happened as all shall happen I mourn for.’<br/>
		All that was bright it misses and only seizes on sorrow.<br/>
		Dear, on the brightness look and if thou must prophesy, tell us<br/>
		Rather of great Pelides slain by my spear in the onset.”<br/>
		But with a voice of grief the sister answered her brother:<br/>
		“Yes, he shall fall and his slayer too perish<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="389" href="#">160</a> and Troy with his
		slayer.”<br/>
		But in his spirit rejoicing Paris answered Cassandra:<br/>
		“Let but this word come true; for the rest, the gods shall avert it.<br/>
		Look once more, O Cassandra, and comfort the heart of thy mother,<br/>
		See, O seer, my safe return with the spoils of Achilles.”<br/>
		And with a voice of grief the sister answered her brother:<br/>
		“Thou shalt return for thy hour while Troy yet stands in the sunshine.”<br/>
		But in his spirit exultant Paris seizing the omen:<br/>
		“Hearst thou, my father, my mother?
		She who still prophesied evil<br/>
		Now perceives of our night this dawning.
		Yet is it grievous,<br/>
		Since through a heart that we love must be pierced the heart of Achilles.<br/>
		Fate, with this evil satisfied, turn in the end from Troya.<br/>
		Bless me, my father, and thou, O Hecuba, mother long-patient,<br/>
		Still forgive that thy children have fallen for Helen and Paris.”<br/>
		Tenderly yearning his mother drew him towards her and murmured:<br/>
		“All for thy hyacinth curls was forgiven even from childhood<br/>
		And for thy sunlit looks, O wonder of charm, O Paris.<br/>
		Paris, my son, though Troy must fall, thy mother forgives thee,<br/>
		Blessing the gods who have lent thee to me for a while in their sunshine.<br/>
		Theirs are fate and result, but ours is the joy of our children;<br/>
		Even the griefs are dear that come from their hands while they love us.<br/>
		Fight and slay Achilles, the murderer dire of thy brothers;<br/>
		Venging Hector return, my son, to the clasp of thy mother.”<br/>
		But in his calm august to Paris Priam the monarch:<br/>
		“Victor so mightst thou come, so gladden the heart of thy mother.”<br/>
		Then to the aged father of Paris Helen the Argive<br/>
		Bright and immortal and sad like a star that grows near to the dawning<br/>
		And on its pale companions looks who now fade from its vision:<br/>
		“Me too pardon and love, my parents, even Helen,<br/>
		Cause of all bane and all death; but I came from the gods for this ruin<br/>
		Born as a torch for the burning of empires, cursed with this beauty.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 401</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-689">Nor have I known a father’s embrace, a mother’s caresses,<br/>
		But to the distant gods I was born and nursed as an alien<br/>
		Here by earth from fear, not affection, compelled by the thunders.<br/>
		Two are her monstrous births, from the Furies and from the immortals;<br/>
		Either touching mortality suffers and bears not the contact.<br/>
		I have been both, a monster of doom and a portent of beauty.”<br/>
		Slowly Priam the monarch answered to Argive Helen:<br/>
		“That which thou art the gods have made thee; thou couldst not be other:<br/>
		That which thou didst, the gods have done; thou couldst not prevent them.<br/>
		Who here shall blame or whom shall he pardon?
		Should not my people<br/>
		Rail at me murmuring, ‘Priam has lost what his fathers had gathered;<br/>
		Cursed is this king by heaven and cursed who are born as his subjects’?<br/>
		Masked the high gods act; the doer is hid by his working.<br/>
		Each of us bears his punishment, fruit of a seed that’s forgotten;<br/>
		Each of us curses his neighbour protecting his heart with illusions:<br/>
		Therefore like children we blame each other and hate and are angry.<br/>
		Take, my child, the joy of the sunshine won by thy beauty.<br/>
		I who lodge on this earth as an alien bound by the body,<br/>
		Wearing my sorrow even as I wear the imperial purple,<br/>
		Praise yet the gods for my days that have seen thee at last in my ending.<br/>
		Fitly Troy may cease having gazed on thy beauty, O Helen.”<br/>
		He became silent, he ceased from words.
		But Paris and Helen<br/>
		Lightly went and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="390" href="#">161</a> gladly; pursuing their footsteps the
		mother,<br/>
		Mother once of Troilus, mother once of Hector,<br/>
		Stood at the door with her death in her eyes, nor returned from her yearning,<br/>
		But as one after a vanishing sunbeam gazes in prison,<br/>
		Gazed down the corridors after him, long who had passed from her vision.<br/>
		Then in the silent chamber Cassandra seized by Apollo<br/>
		Staggered erect and tossing her snow-white arms of affliction<br/>
		Cried to the heavens in her pain; for the fierce god tortured her bosom:<br/>
		“Woe is me, woe for the guile and the bitter gift of Apollo!<br/>
		Woe, thrice woe, for my birth in Troy and the lineage of Teucer!<br/>
		So do you deal, O gods, with those who have served you and laboured,<br/>
		Those who have borne for your sake the evil burden of greatness.<br/>
		Blessed is he who holds mattock in hand or who bends o’er the furrow<br/>
		Taking no thought for the good of mankind, with no yearnings for knowledge.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 402</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-690">Woe unto me for my wisdom which none shall value nor hearken!<br/>
		Woe unto thee, O King, for thy strength which shall not deliver!<br/>
		Better the eye that is sealed, more blest is the spirit that’s feeble.<br/>
		Vainly your hopes with iron Necessity struggle, O mortals.<br/>
		Virtue shall lie in her pangs, for the gods have need of her torture;<br/>
		Sin shall be scourged, though her deeds were compelled by the gods in their anger.<br/>
		None shall avail in the end, the coward shall die and the hero.<br/>
		Troy shall fall in her sin and her virtues shall not protect her;<br/>
		Argos shall grow by her crimes till the gods shall destroy her for ever.<br/>
		Now have I fruit of thy love, O Loxias, dreadful Apollo.<br/>
		Woe is me, woe for the flame that approaches the house of my fathers!<br/>
		Woe is me, woe for the hand of Ajax laid on my tresses!<br/>
		Woe, thrice woe to him who shall ravish and him who shall cherish!<br/>
		Woe for the ships that shall bound too swift o’er the azure Aegean!<br/>

		So with her voice of the swan she clanged out doom on the peoples,<br/>
		Over the palace of Priam and over the armèd nation<br/>
		Marching resolved to the war in the pride of its centuries conquered,<br/>
		Centuries slain by a single day of the anger of heaven.<br/>
		Dim to the thoughts like a vision of Hades the luminous chamber<br/>
		Grew; in his ivory chair King Priam sat like a shadow<br/>
		Throned mid the ghosts of departed kings and forgotten empires.<br/>
		But in his valiance careless and blithe the Priamid hastened<br/>
		Seeking the pillared megaron wide where Deiphobus armoured<br/>
		Waited his coming forth with the warlike chiefs of the Trojans.<br/>
		Now as he passed by the halls of the women, the chambers that harboured<br/>
		Daughters and wives of King Priam and wives of his sons and their playmates,<br/>
		Niches of joy that were peopled with murmurs and sweet-tongued laughters,<br/>
		Troubled like trees with their birds in a morning of sun and of shadow<br/>
		Where in some garden of kings one walks with his heart in the sunshine,<br/>
		Out from her door where she stood for him waiting Polyxena started,<br/>
		Seized his hand and looked in his face and spoke to her brother.<br/>
		Then not even the brilliant strength of Paris availed him;<br/>
		Joyless he turned his face from her eyes of beauty and sorrow.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 403</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-691">“So it is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="393" href="#">164</a> come, the hour that I

		Armed with the strength of Fate to strike at my heart in the battle;<br/>
		For he is doomed and thou and I, a victim to Hades.<br/>
		This thou preferrest and neither thy father could move nor thy mother<br/>
		Burning with Troy in their palace, nor could thy country persuade thee,<br/>
		Nor dost thou care for thy sister’s happiness pierced by thy arrows.<br/>
		Will she remember it all, my sister Helen, in Argos<br/>
		Passing tranquil days with her husband, bright Menelaus,<br/>
		Holding her child on her knees?
		But we shall lie joyless in Hades.”<br/>
		Paris replied: “O sister<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="394" href="#">165</a> Polyxena, blame me not wholly.<br/>
		We by the gods are ensnared; for the pitiless white Aphrodite<br/>
		Doing her will with us both compels this.
		Helpless our hearts are<br/>
		And when she drives perforce must love, for death or for gladness:<br/>
		Weighed in unequal scales she deals them to one or another.<br/>
		Happy who holding his love can go down into bottomless Hades.”<br/>
		But to her brother replied in her anguish the daughter of Priam:<br/>
		“Evilly deal with my<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="395" href="#">166</a> days the immortals happy in heaven;<br/>
		Yes, I accuse the gods and I curse them who heed not our sorrow.<br/>

		One whose terrible hands have been stained with the blood of my brothers.<br/>
		This now they do, they have taken the two whom I love beyond heaven,<br/>
		Brother and husband, and drive to the fight to be slain by each other.<br/>
		Nay, go thou forth; for thou canst not help it, nor I, nor can Helen.<br/>
		Since I must die as a pageant to satisfy Zeus and his daughter,<br/>
		Since now my heart must be borne as a victim bleeding to please them,<br/>
		So let it be, let me deck myself and be bright for the altar.”<br/>
		Into her chamber she turned with her great eyes blind, unregarding;<br/>
		He for a moment stood, then passed to the megaron slowly;<br/>
		Dim was the light in his eyes and clouded his glorious beauty.<br/>
		Meanwhile armed in the palace of Priam Penthesilea.<br/>
		Near her her captains silent and mighty stood, from the Orient<br/>
		Distant clouds of war, Surabdas and iron Surenas,<br/>
		Pharatus planned like the hills, Somaranes, Valarus, Tauron,<br/>
		High-crested Sumalus, Arithon, Sambus<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="396" href="#">167</a> and Artavoruxes.<br/>
		There too the princes of Phrygian Troya gathered for counsel<br/>
		And with them Eurus came, Polydamas’ son, who most dearly<br/>
		Loved was of all the Trojan boys by the glorious virgin.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 404</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-692">She from her arming stayed to caress his curls and to chide him:<br/>
		“Eurus, forgotten of grace, dost thou gad like a stray in the city<br/>
		Eager to mix with the armoured men and the chariots gliding?<br/>
		High on the roofs wouldst thou watch the swaying speck that is battle?<br/>
		Better to aim with the dart or seek with thy kind the palaestra;<br/>
		So wilt thou sooner be part of this greatness rather than straining<br/>
		Yearn from afar to the distance that veils the deeds of the mighty.”<br/>
		But with an anxious lure in his smile on her Eurus answered:<br/>
		“Not that remoteness to see have I come to the palace of Priam<br/>
		Leaving the house of my fathers, but for the spear and the breastpiece.<br/>
		Hast thou not promised me long I shall fight in thy car with Achilles?”<br/>
		Doubtful he eyed her, a lion’s cub at play in his beauty,<br/>
		And mid the heroes who heard him laughter arose for a moment,<br/>
		Yet with a sympathy stirred; they remembered the days of their childhood,<br/>
		Thought<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="397" href="#">168</a> of Troy still mighty, life in its rose-touched
		dawning<br/>
		When they had longed for the clash of the fight and the burden of armour.<br/>
		Glad, with the pride of the lioness watching her cub in the desert,–<br/>
		Couchant she lies with her paws before her and joys in his gambols,<br/>
		Over the prey as he frisks and is careless,– answered the virgin:<br/>
		“Younger than thou in my nation have mounted the steed and the war-car.<br/>
		Eurus, arm; from under my shield thou shalt gaze at the Phthian,<br/>
		Reaching my shafts for the cast from the rim of my car in the battle<br/>
		Handle perhaps the spear that shall smite down the Phthian Achilles.<br/>
		What sayst thou, Halamus?
		Were not such prowess a perfect beginning<br/>
		Worthy Polydamas’ son and the warlike house of Antenor?”<br/>
		Halamus started and smiting his hand on the grief of his bosom,<br/>
		Sombre replied and threatened with Fate the high-hearted virgin.<br/>
		“Virgin armipotent, wherefore mockst thou thy friend, though unwitting?<br/>
		Nay,– for the world will know at the end and my death cannot hide it,–<br/>
		Slain by a father’s curse we fight who are kin to Antenor.<br/>
		Take not the boy in thy car, lest the Furies, Penthesilea,<br/>
		Aim through the shield and the shielder to wreak the curse of the grandsire.<br/>
		They will not turn nor repent for thy strength nor his delicate beauty.”<br/>
		Swiftly to Halamus answered the high-crested might<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="398" href="#">169</a> of the

		“Curses leave lightly the lips when the soul of a man is in anger<br/>

		Give me the boy; a hero shall come back formed from the onset.”<br/>
		“Do as thou wilt,” replied Halamus; “Fate shall guard or shall end him.”<br/>
		Then to the boy delighted and smiling-eyed and exultant<br/>

		thy fathers,<br/>
		See that thou fight on this day like the comrade of Penthesilea.<br/>
		Bud of a hero, gaze unalarmed in the eyes of Achilles.”<br/>
		Light as a hound released he ran to the hall of the armour<br/>
		Where were the shields of the mighty, the arms of the mansion of Teucer;<br/>
		There from the house-thralls he wrung the greaves and the cuirass and helmet<br/>
		Troilus wore, the wonderful boy who, ere ripened his prowess,<br/>
		Conquered the Greeks and drove to the ships and fought with Achilles.<br/>
		These on his boyish limbs he donned and ran back exulting<br/>
		Bearing spears and a sword and rejoiced in the clank on his armour.<br/>
		Meanwhile Deiphobus, head of the mellay, moved by Aeneas<br/>
		Opened the doors of their warlike debate to the strength of the virgin:<br/>
		“Well do I hope that our courage outwearying every opponent<br/>
		Triumph shall lift to her ancient seat on the Pergaman turrets;<br/>
		Clouds from Zeus come and pass; his sunshine eternal survives them.<br/>
		Yet we are few in the fight and armoured nations besiege us.<br/>
		Surging on Troy today a numberless foe well-captained<br/>
		Hardly pushed back in shock after shock with the Myrmidon numbers<br/>
		Swelled returns; they fight with a hope that broken refashion<br/>
		Helpful skies and a man now leads them who conquers and slaughters,<br/>
		One of the sons of the gods and armed by the gods for the struggle.<br/>
		We unhelped save by Ares stern and the mystic Apollo<br/>
		And but as mortals striving with stubborn mortal courage,<br/>
		Hated and scorned and alone in the world, by the nations rejected,<br/>
		Fight with the gods and mankind and Achilles and numbers against us<br/>
		Keeping our country from death in this bitter hour of her fortunes.<br/>
		Therefore have prudence and hardihood severed contending our counsels<br/>
		Whether far out to fight on the seaward plain with the Argives<br/>
		Or behind Xanthus the river impetuous friendly to Troya.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 406</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-694">This my brother approves and the son of Antenor advises,<br/>

		Rather as Zeus with his spear of the lightning and chariot of tempest<br/>
		Scatters and chases the heavy mass of the clouds through the heavens,<br/>
		So would I hunt the Greeks through the plains to their lair by the Ocean,<br/>
		Straight at the throat of my foeman so would I leap in the battle.<br/>
		Swiftly to smite at the foe is prudence for armies outnumbered.”<br/>
		Then to the Dardanid answered the high-crested Penthesilea:<br/>
		“There where I find my foe I will fight him, whether by Xanthus<br/>
		Or at the fosse of the ships where they crouch behind bulwarks for shelter,<br/>
		Or if they dare by Scamander the higher marching on Troya.”<br/>

		Then if the fierce gods prevail we shall perish not driven like cattle<br/>
		Over the plains, but draw back sternly and slowly to Troya.”<br/>
		Answered the Priamid, “Wise is thy counsel, branch of Antenor.<br/>
		Chaff are the southern Achaians, only the hardihood Hellene,<br/>
		Only the savage speed of the Locrian rescues their legions.<br/>
		Marshal we so this<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="405" href="#">176</a> field.
		Stand, Halamus, covering Xanthus,<br/>
		Helping our need when the foe press hard on the Ilian fighters.<br/>
		Paris, my brother, thou with our masses aid the Eoan.<br/>
		I with Aeneas’ single spear am enough for the Argive.”<br/>
		“Gladlier” Halamus cried “would I fight in the front with the Locrian!<br/>
		This too let be as you will; for one is the glory and service<br/>
		Fighting in front or guarding behind the fate of our country.”<br/>
		So in their thoughts they ordered battle.
		Meanwhile Eurus<br/>
		Gleaming returned and the room grew glad with the light of his armour.<br/>
		Glad were its conscious walls of that vision of boyhood and valour;<br/>
		Gods of the household sighed and smiled at his courage and beauty,<br/>
		They who had seen so many pass over their floors and return not<br/>
		Hasting to battle, the fair and the mighty<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="406" href="#">177</a>, the curled and the

		All of them treading one path like the conscious masks of one pageant<br/>
		Winding past through the glare of a light to the shadows<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="407" href="#">178</a> beyond
		them.<br/>
		But on her captains proudly smiling Penthesilea<br/>
		Seized him and cried aloud, her wild and warlike nature<br/>
		Moved by the mother’s heart that the woman loses not ever.<br/>
		“Who then shall fear for the fate of Troy when such are her children?<br/>
		Verily, Eurus, yearning has seized me to meet thee in battle</p>

		But, when this war ends, will bear thee away to the hills of my country<br/>
		And, as a robber might, with my captive glad and unwilling<br/>

		“Twenty years have passed, O Tryas, chief of the Trojans,<br/>

		Soothed by the lyre or hearing the chanted deeds of the mighty<br/>
		Or does he walk as he loves by the shore of the far-sounding waters?”<br/>
		And to the Argive herald grey Automedon answered:<br/>
		“Now from the meal he rests and Briseis lyres to him singing<br/>
		One of the Ilian chants of old in the tongue of the Trojans.”</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 412</p>

		So as they spoke, they beheld far-off the tent of Achilles<br/>

		Now that he stands confronting his fate in the town of his fathers.<br/>
		Peace dwells not in thy aspect.
		Sowst thou a seed then of ruin<br/>
		Cast from the inflexible heart and the faltering tongue of Aeneas,<br/>
		Or with the golden laugh of the tameless bright Alexander?”<br/>
		Grey Talthybius answered, “Surely their doom has embraced them<br/>
		Wrapping her locks round their ears and their eyes, lest they see and escape her,<br/>
		Kissing their tongue with her fatal lips and dictating its answers.<br/>
		Dire is the hope of their chiefs and fierce is the will of their commons.<br/>
		‘Son of the Aeacids, spurned is thy offer.

		Rather we choose; it is nearer to Dardanus, King of the Hellenes.<br/>
		Neither shall Helen captive be dragged to the feet of her husband,<br/>
		Nor down the paths of peace revisit her fathers’ Eurotas.<br/>
		Death and the fire may prevail on us, never our wills shall surrender<br/>

		But to the strength of Pelides the hero Acirrous answered:<br/>
		“Response none make<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="522" href="#">293</a> the Greeks to thy high-voiced message and
		challenge;<br/>
		Only their shout at thy side will reply when thou leapst into Troya.<br/>
		So have their chieftains willed and the wisdom calm of Odysseus.”<br/>
		But with a haughty scorn made answer the high-crested Hellene:<br/>
		“Wise is Odysseus, wise are the hearts of Achaia’s chieftains.<br/>
		Ilion’s chiefs are enough for their strength and life is too brittle<br/>
		Hurrying Fate to advance on the spear of the Phthian Achilles.”<br/>
		“Not from the Greeks have I sped to thy tents, their friendship or quarrel<br/>

		Far-crashing into the fight that has lacked this shoot of Achilles,<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-725">Seal of the ancient friendship new-sworn twixt your sires in their boyhood<br/>
		Then when they learned the spear to guide and strove in the wrestle.”<br/>
		So he spoke recalling other times and regretted<br/>
		And to the Argive’s word consented the strength of Pelides.<br/>
		He on the shoulder white of his son with a gesture of parting<br/>
		Laid his fateful hand and spoke from his prescient spirit:<br/>
		“Pyrrhus, go.
		No mightier guide couldst thou hope into battle<br/>
		Opening the foemen’s ranks than the hero stern Diomedes.<br/>
		Noble that rugged heart, thy father’s friend and his father’s.<br/>
		Journey through all wide Greece, seek her prytanies, schools and palaestras,<br/>
		Traverse Ocean’s rocks and the cities that dream on his margin,<br/>
		Phocian dales, Aetolia’s cliffs and Arcady’s pastures,<br/>
		Never a second man wilt thou find, but alone Diomedes.<br/>
		Pyrrhus, follow his counsels always losing thy father,<br/>
		If in this battle I fall and Fate has denied to me Troya.<br/>
		Pyrrhus, be like thy father in virtue, thou canst not excel him;<br/>
		Noble be in peace, invincible, brave in the battle,<br/>
		Stern and calm to thy foe, to the suppliant merciful.
		Mortal<br/>
		Favour and wrath as thou walkst heed never, son of Achilles.<br/>
		Always thy will and the right impose on thy friend and thy foeman.<br/>
		Count not life nor death, defeat nor triumph, Pyrrhus.<br/>
		Only thy soul regard and the gods in thy joy or thy labour.”<br/>
		Pyrrhus heard and erect with a stride that was rigid and stately<br/>
		Forth with Acirrous went from his sire to the joy of the battle.<br/>
		Little he heeded the word of death that the god in our bosom<br/>
		Spoke from the lips of Achilles, but deemed at sunset returning,<br/>
		Slaying Halamus, Paris or dangerous mighty Aeneas,<br/>
		Proudly to lay at his father’s feet the spoils of the foeman.<br/>
		But in his lair alone the godlike doomed Pelides<br/>
		Turned to the door of his tent and was striding forth to the battle,<br/>
		When from her inner chamber Briseis parting the curtain,–<br/>
		Long had she stood there spying and waiting her lonely occasion,–<br/>
		Came and caught and held his hand like a creeper detaining<br/>
		Vainly a moment the deathward stride of the kings of the forest.<br/>
		“Tarry awhile, Achilles; not yet have the war-horns clamoured,<br/>

<p class="p-num">Page 438</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-726">Nay, had war sounded, thou yet wouldst squander that moment, Achilles,<br/>

		Art thou not fairer than woman’s beauty, yet great as Apollo? –<br/>
		Fearing Paris’ shafts and the anger of Delian Phoebus.<br/>

		Over the sea in my dream an argent bow was extended;<br/>

		Then three times I heard arise in the grandiose silence,–<br/>
		Still was the sky and still was the land and still were the waters,–<br/>
		Echoing a mighty voice, ‘Take back, O King, what thou gavest;<br/>
		Strength, take thy strong man, sea, take thy wave, till the warfare eternal<br/>
		Need him again to thunder through Asia’s plains to the Ganges.’</p>

		I awoke and found myself trembling,<br/>

		Lo, in the night came this dream; on the morn thou arisest for battle.”<br/>
		But to Briseis white-armed made answer the golden Achilles:<br/>
		“This was a dream indeed, O princess, daughter of Brises!<br/>
		Will it restrain Achilles from fight, the lion from preying?<br/>
		Come, thou hast heard of my prowess and knowest what man is Achilles.<br/>
		Deemst thou so near my end? or does Polyxena vex thee,<br/>
		Jealousy shaping thy dreams to frighten me back from her capture?”<br/>
		Passionate, vexed Briseis, smiting his arm with her fingers,<br/>
		Yet with a smile half-pleased made answer to mighty Achilles.<br/>
		“Thinkst thou I fear thee at all?
		I am brave and will chide thee and threaten.<br/>
		See that thou recklessly throw not, Achilles, thy life into battle<br/>
		Hurting this body, my world, nor venture sole midst thy foemen,<br/>
		Leaving thy shielders behind as oft thou art wont in thy war-rage<br/>

		Dost thou not know all the terrible void and cold desolation<br/>
		Once again my life must become if I lose thee, Achilles?<br/>
		Twice then thus wilt thou smite me, O hero, a desolate woman?<br/>
		I will not stay behind on an earth that is empty and kingless.<br/>
		Into the grave I will leap, through the fire I will burn, I will follow<br/>
		Down into Hades’ depths or wherever thy footsteps go clanging,<br/>
		Hunting thee always,– didst thou not seize me here for thy pleasure? –<br/>
		Stronger there by my love as thou than I here, O Achilles.<br/>
		Thou shalt not dally alone with Polyxena safe in the shadows.”<br/>
		But to Briseis answered the hero, mighty Pelides,<br/>
		Holding her delicate hands like gathered flowers in his bosom,<br/>
		Pressing her passionate mouth like a rose that trembles with beauty.<br/>
		“There then follow me even as I would have drawn thee, O woman,<br/>

		“Zeus, I see and I am not deceived by thy words in my spirit.<br/>

		So with her aegis scattering light o’er the heads of the nations<br/>

		Still I repine not, but toil; for to toil I was<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="562" href="#">333</a> yoked by my
		Maker.<br/>
		I am your servant, O Gods, and his of whom you are servants.”<br/>
		But to the toiler Zeus replied, to the servant of creatures:<br/>
		“What is the thought thou hast uttered betrayed by thy speech, O Hephaestus?<br/>
		True is it earth shall grow as a smithy, the smoke of the furnace<br/>
		Fill men’s eyes and their souls shall be stunned with the clang of the hammers;<br/>
		Yet in the end there is rest on the peak of a labour accomplished.<br/>
		Nor shall the might of the thinker be quelled by that iron oppression,<br/>
		Nor shall the soul of the warrior despair in the darkness triumphant;<br/>

		Dust like a flag and dire with the battle-cry, full on the Hellenes.<br/>
		They to the mid-plain arrived where the might of the Hellene brothers<br/>
		Waited their coming<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="579" href="#">350</a>.
		Zethus first with his cry of the cascade<br/>
		Hurrying-footed, headlong that leaps far down to the valley:<br/>
		“Curb, but curb thy advance, O Amazon Penthesilea!<br/>
		These are not Gnossus’ ranks and these are not levies from Sparta.<br/>
		Hellas’ spears await thee here and the Myrmidon fighters.”<br/>
		But like the northwind high and clear answered Penthesilea<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="580" href="#">351</a>,<br/>
		High like the northwind racing and whistling over the icefields,<br/>
		Death at its side and snow for its breath in the pitiless winter:<br/>
		“Who art thou biddest to pause the horsehooves of Penthesilea?<br/>
		Hellene, thou in thy strength who standest forth from thy shielders,<br/>
		Turn yet, save thy life; for I deem that thou art not Achilles.”<br/>
		“Zethus the Hellene I am and
		Cycnus and Pindus, my brothers,<br/>
		Stand at my either side, and thou passest no<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="581" href="#">352</a> farther,
		Bellona.<br/>
		Lioness, turn thou back, for thou canst not here be a hunter.”<br/>
		“Zethus and Cycnus and Pindus, little you loved then your mother<br/>
		Who in this field that is wide must needs all three perish together<br/>
		Piled on one altar of death by the spear-shafts of Penthesilea.<br/>
		Empty for ever your halls shall be, childless the age of your father.”<br/>
		High she rose to the spear-cast, poised like a thunderbolt lifted,<br/>
		Forward swung to the blow and loosed it hissing and ruthless<br/>
		Straight at the Hellene shield, and it tore through the bronze and groaning<br/>
		Butted and pushed through the cuirass and split the breast of the hero.<br/>
		Round in his car he spun, then putting his hands out before him,<br/>
		Even as a diver who leaps from the shed of the bath to the current,<br/>
		Launched out so headlong, struggled, sideward collapsed, then was quiet,<br/>
		Dead on Trojan earth.
		But dismay and grief on his brothers<br/>
		Yet alive now seized, then rage came blinding the eyeballs.<br/>
		Blindly they hurled, yet attained, for Athene guided the spear-shafts;<br/>
		Death like a forest beast yet played with the might of the virgin.<br/>
		One on her shield and one on her cuirass rang, but rejected<br/>
		Fell back like reeds that are thrown at a boulder by boys on the seashore.<br/>
		She unmoved replied; her shafts in their angry succession<br/>
		Hardly endured delay between.
		Like trees the brothers,</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-757">Felled, to each side sank prone.
		So lifeless these strong ones of Hellas<br/>
		Lay on<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="582" href="#">353</a> their couch of the hostile soil reunited in slumber<br/>
		As in their childhood they lay in Hellas watched by their mother,<br/>
		Three of them side by side and she dreamed for her darlings their future.<br/>
		But on the ranks of the Hellenes fear and amazement descended,–<br/>
		Messengers they from Zeus to discourage the pride and the blood-lust.<br/>
		Back many yards their foremost recoiled in a god-given terror,<br/>
		As from a snake a traveller scorned for a bough by the wayside,<br/>
		But it arises puffing its hood and hisses its hatred.<br/>
		Forward the henchmen ran and plucked back the spears from the corpses;<br/>
		Onward the Eoan thousands rolled o’er the ground that was conquered<br/>
		Trampling the fallen men into earth with the wheels of their war-cars.<br/>
		But in her speed like the sea or the stormwind Penthesilea<br/>
		Drove towards the ranks of the foe and her spear-shafts hastened before her,<br/>
		Messengers whistling shrilly to Death; he<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="583" href="#">354</a> came like a
		wolfhound<br/>
		Called by his master’s voice and silently fell on the quarry.<br/>
		Hyrtamus fell, Admetus was wounded, Charmidas slaughtered;<br/>
		Cirrhes died, though he faced not the blow while he hastened to shelter.<br/>
		Itylus, bright and beautiful, went down to night and to Hades.<br/>
		Back, ever back the Hellenes recoiled from the shock of the Virgin,<br/>
		Slain by her prowess fierce, alarmed by the might of her helpers.<br/>
		For at her right Surabdas threatened and iron Surenas,<br/>
		And at her left hill-shouldered Pharatus slaughtered the Hellenes.<br/>
		Then in the ranks of the Greeks a shouting arose and the leaders<br/>
		Cried to their hosts and recalled their unstained fame and their valour<br/>
		Never so lightly conquered before in the onsets<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="584" href="#">355</a> of Ares<br/>
		And of Achilles they spoke and King Peleus waiting in Phthia,<br/>
		Listening for Troy o’erthrown<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="585" href="#">356</a> not his hosts overcome by a
		woman.<br/>
		And from the right and the left came heroes mighty to succour.<br/>
		Chiefs of the Dolopes Ar and Aglauron came mid the foremost,<br/>
		Hillus fair as a drifting moon but fierce as the winter;<br/>
		Pryas came the Thessalian and Sebes whom Pharsalus honoured,<br/>
		Victors in countless fights who had stood against Memnon and Hector.<br/>
		But though their hands were mighty, though fierce their obdurate natures,<br/>
		Mightier strengths they met and a sterner brood of the war-god.<br/>
		Light from the hand of the Virgin the spear ran laughing at Sebes,<br/>
		Crashed through his helmet and left him supine on the pastures of Troya;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 470</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-758">Ar to Surabdas fell and the blood-spirting head of Aglauron<br/>
		Dropped like a fruit from a branch by its weight to the discus of Sambus;<br/>
		Iron Surenas’ mace-head shattered the beauty of Hillus;<br/>
		Pryas by Pharatus slain lay still and had rest from the war-cry.<br/>
		Back, ever back reeled the Hellene host with the Virgin pursuing.<br/>
		Storm-shod the Amazon fought and she slew like a god unresisted.<br/>
		None now dared to confront her burning eyes; the boldest<br/>
		Shuddered back from her spear and the cry of her tore at their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="586" href="#">357</a>
		heart-strings.<br/>
		Fear, the daughter of Zeus, had gripped at the hearts of the Hellenes.<br/>
		So as their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="587" href="#">358</a> heroes yielded before her, Penthesilea<br/>
		Lifted with victory cried to her henchman, Aurus of Ellae,<br/>
		Who had the foot of the wind and its breath that scants not for running,<br/>
		“Hasten, hasten, Aurus; race to the right where unwarring<br/>
		Valarus leads his host; bid him close with the strength of the Hellenes.<br/>
		Soon will they scatter like chaff on the threshing-floor blown to the beaches.<br/>
		But when he sees their flight by Sumalus shepherded seaward,<br/>
		Swift let him turn like the wind in its paths and follow me, pouring<br/>
		All in a victor flood<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="588" href="#">359</a> on the Myrmidon left and Achilles.<br/>
		Then shall no Hellene again dare embark in ships for the Troad.<br/>
		Cursed shall its beaches be to their sons and their sons and for ever.”<br/>
		So she spoke and Aurus ran by the chariots<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="589" href="#">360</a> protected.<br/>
		Then had all Hellas perished indeed on the beaches of Troas,<br/>
		But from the Argives’<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="590" href="#">361</a> right where she battled Pallas
		Athene<br/>
		Saw and was wroth and she missioned her thought to Automedon speeding.<br/>
		Splendid it came and found him out mid the hiss of the spear-shafts<br/>
		Guiding, endangered, Achilles’ steeds in the thick of the battle.<br/>
		Shaped like a woman clad in armour and fleeing from battle,<br/>
		Helmed with the Hellene crest it knocked at the gates<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="591" href="#">362</a> of his
		spirit<br/>
		Shaking the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="592" href="#">363</a> hero’s heart with the vision that came to his
		eyeballs;<br/>
		Silent he stared aghast and turned his ear to the war-din.<br/>
		“Dost thou not hear to our right, Achilles, these voices of Ares?<br/>
		High is the sound of Eoan battle, a woman’s war-cry<br/>
		Rings in my ears, but faint and sparse come the shouts of our nation.<br/>
		Far behind is their call and nearer the ships and the beaches.”<br/>
		Great Pelides heard and groaned in the caves of his spirit:<br/>
		“It is the doom that I feared and the fatal madness of Zethus;<br/>
		Slain are the men of my nation<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="593" href="#">364</a> or routed by Penthesilea.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="CP-759">Drive, Automedon, drive, lest shame and defeat upon Hellas<br/>
		Fasten their seal and her heroes flee from the strength of a woman.”<br/>
		And to the steeds divine Automedon called and they hearkened,<br/>
		Rose as if seeking their old accustomed paths in the heavens,<br/>
		Then through the ranks that parted they galloped as gallops the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="594" href="#">365</a>
		dust-cloud<br/>
		When the cyclone is abroad and the high trees snap by the wayside,<br/>
		And from the press of the Hellenes into the plain of the Xanthus<br/>
		Thundering, neighing came with the war-car borne like a dead leaf<br/>
		Chased by the blast.
		Then Athene opened the eyes of Achilles,<br/>
		Eyes that in all of us sleep, yet can see the near and the distant,<br/>
		Eyes that the gods in their pity have sealed from the giant confusion,<br/>
		Sealed from the bale and the grief.
		He saw like one high on a summit<br/>
		Near him the Eoans holding the plain and out in the distance<br/>
		Breaking the Hellene strengths.
		Like a dream in the night he regarded<br/>
		High-crested Sumalus fight<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="595" href="#">366</a>, Somaranes swift in the onset,<br/>
		Bull-shouldered Tauron’s blows and the hero Artavoruxes.<br/>
		But in the centre fiercest the cry and the death and the fleeing.<br/>
		There were his chieftains ever reforming vainly resistance,–<br/>
		Even in defeat these were Hellenes and fit to be hosts of Achilles,–<br/>
		But like a doom on them thundered the war-car of Penthesilea,<br/>
		Pharatus smote and Surabdas and Sambus and iron Surenas.<br/>
		Down the leaders fell and the armies reeled towards the Ocean.<br/>
		Wroth he cried to his coursers and fiercely they heard and they hastened;<br/>
		Swift like a wind o’er the grasses galloped the car of Achilles.<br/>
		Echemus followed, Ascanus drove and Drus and Thretaon:<br/>
		Phoces alone in the dust of the Troad lay there and moved not.<br/>
		Yet brought not all of them help to their brothers oppressed in the combat:<br/>
		For from the forefront forth on the knot of the swift-speeding war-cars<br/>
		High an Eoan chariot came drawn fast by its coursers<br/>
		Bearing a mighty chieftain, Valarus son of Supaures.<br/>
		Fire-footed thundered past him the hooves of the heavenly coursers,<br/>
		Nor to his challenging shout nor his spear the warlike Pelides<br/>
		Answered at all, but made haste like a flood to the throng and the mellay.<br/>
		But twixt<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="596" href="#">367</a> the chariots behind and their leader the mighty
		Eoan<br/>
		Drove his dark-maned steeds and stood like a cliff to their onset.<br/>
		“Great is your haste, O ye Kings of the Greeks!
		Abide yet and converse.<br/>
		Scatheless your leader has fled from me borne by the hooves of his coursers;</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 472</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-760">Ye, abide!
		For we meet from far lands on this soil of the Trojans.<br/>
		All of us meet from afar, but not all shall return to their hearthsides.<br/>
		Valarus stays you, O Greeks, and this is the point of his greeting.”<br/>
		So as he spoke he launched out his spear as a cloud hurls its storm-flash;<br/>
		Nor from that fatal hand parted vainly the pitiless envoy,<br/>
		But of its blood-thirst had right.
		Riven through and through with the death-stroke<br/>
		Drus fell prone and tore with dying fingers the grasses.<br/>
		Sobbing his soul fled out to the night and the chill and the silence.<br/>
		They like leaves that are suddenly stayed by the fall of a wind-gust<br/>
		Ceased from their headlong speed.
		And Echemus poising his spear-shaft:<br/>
		“Sharp are thy greetings, chieftain Eoan.
		Message for message<br/>
		Echemus son of Aëtes, one of the mighty in Hellas,<br/>
		Thus returns.
		Let Ares judge twixt<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="597" href="#">368</a> the Greek and the Eastern.”<br/>
		Fast sped the spear but Valarus held forth his shield and rebutted<br/>
		Shouting the deadly point that could pierce not his iron refusal.<br/>
		“Echemus, surely<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="598" href="#">369</a> thy vaunt has reached me, but unfelt is thy
		spear-point.<br/>
		Weak are men’s arms, it seems, in Hellas; a boy there Ares<br/>
		Aims with reeds not spears at pastoral cheeses not iron.<br/>
		Judge now my strength.”
		Two spears from him ran at the hearts of his foemen.<br/>
		Crouching Thretaon heard the keen death over him whistle;<br/>
		Ascanus hurt in the shoulder cried out and paused from his war-lust.<br/>
		Echemus hurled now again and hurled with him stalwart Thretaon.<br/>
		Strong Thretaon missed, but Echemus’ point at the helmet<br/>
		Bit and fastened as fastens a hound on the ear of the wild-boar<br/>
		Wroth with the cry and the hunt that gores the pack and his hunters.<br/>
		Valarus frowning tugged at the heavy steel; yet his right hand<br/>
		Smote at Echemus.
		Him he missed but valiant Thretaon<br/>
		Sat back dead in his seat and the chariot wild with its coursers<br/>
		Snorting and galloping bore his corpse o’er the plains to the Hellenes.<br/>
		But while yet Valarus strove with the shaft, obscured and encumbered,<br/>
		Ascanus sprang down swift from his car and armed with his sword-point<br/>
		Clove the Eoan’s neck as the lightning springs at an oak-trunk<br/>
		Seized in the stride of the storm and severs that might with its sharpness.<br/>
		Slain the hero fell; his mighty limbs the spirit<br/>
		Mightier released to the gods and it rose to the heavens of the noble.</p>
<p class="p-num">Page 473</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-761">Ascanus gathered the spear-shafts<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="599" href="#">370</a>;

		“Lie there, Valarus, king of the East, with imperial Troya.<br/>
		Six rich feet of her soil she gives thee for couch of the nuptials.<br/>
		Rest then! talk not again on the way with the heroes of Hellas.”<br/>
		So delivered they hastened glad to the ranks of their brothers.<br/>

		Wroth at their chieftain’s fall they moved to the help of their nation<br/>

		Lifted eyes dismayed, but saw the familiar war-car,<br/>
		Saw the heaven-born steeds and the helm unconquered in battle,<br/>

		Only is calm so sweet?
		Is our end tranquillity only?<br/>
		Chill are your rivers of peace and their banks are leafless and lonely.<br/>
		Art thou not sated with sunlight only, cold in its lustre?<br/>
		Art thou not weary of only the stars in their solemn muster?<br/>
		Always the hills and the high-hung plateaus,– solitude’s voices<br/>
		Making the silence lonelier!
		Only the eagle rejoices<br/>
		In the inhuman height of his nesting,– austerely striving,<br/>
		Deaf with the cry of the waterfall, only the pine there is thriving.<br/>
		We have the voice of the cuckoo, the nightingale sings in the branches,<br/>
		Human laughter leads and the cattle low in the ranches.<br/>
		Come to our tangled sunbeams, dawn on our twilights and shadows,<br/>
		Taste with us, scent with us fruits of our trees and flowers of our meadows.<br/>
		Art thou an angel of God in His heavens that they vaunt of, His sages?<br/>

		O Woman, joy’s delicate blossom<br/>
		Sleeps in thy lids of delight!
		All Nature laughs in thy bosom<br/>
		Hiding her children unborn and the food of her love and her laughter.<br/>
		Is He then first?
		Was there none before Him? shall none come after?<br/>
		We too have gods,– the Tritons rise in the leap of the billows,<br/>
		Emerald locks of the Nereids stream on their foam-crested pillows,<br/>
		Dryads sway out from the branches, Naiads glance up through the waters;<br/>
		Heaven has dances of joy and the gods are ensnared by her daughters.<br/>
		Artemis calls as she flees through the glades and the breezes pursue her,<br/>
		Cypris laughs in her isles where the Ocean-winds linger to woo her.<br/>
		Thou shalt behold in glades forgotten the dance of the Graces,<br/>
		Night shall be haunted for ever with strange and delicate faces.<br/>
		Lo, all these peoples and who was it fashioned them?
		Who is unwilling<br/>
		Still to have done with it? laughs beyond pain and saves in the killing?<br/>
		Nature, you say; but is God then her enemy?
		Was she created,<br/>
		He unknowing or sleeping?
		Did someone transgress the fated<br/>
		Limits He set, outwitting God?
		Nay, we know it was fashioned<br/>
		By the Almighty One, million-ecstasied, thousand-passioned.<br/>
		But He created a discord within it, fashioned a limit?<br/>
		Fashioned or feigned<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="655" href="#">48</a>? for He set completeness beyond.
		To disclaim it,<br/>
		To be content with our measure, they say, is the law of our living.<br/>
		Rather to follow always and, baffled, still to go striving.<br/>
		Yes, it is true that we dash ourselves stark on a barrier appearing,<br/>
		Fall and are wounded.
		But He insists who is in us, the fearing<br/>

		We resist; His temptations leap down compelling;<br/>
		Virtue cheats us with noble names to a lofty rebelling.<br/>

		Yet ’tis His strengths descend crying always, “Rebel; aspire!”<br/>
		Still through the night He sends rays, to our bosoms a quenchless fire.<br/>
		Most to our joys He sets limits, most with His pangs He perplexes;<br/>
		Yet when we faint it is He that spurs.
		Temptation vexes;<br/>

		The hedges, the screening,<br/>
		Are they not all His play?
		In our end we have rapture for ever<br/>
		Careless of Time, with no fear of the end, with no need for endeavour.<br/>
		What was the garden He built when the stars were first set in their places,<br/>
		Man and woman together mid streams and in cloudless spaces,<br/>
		Naked and innocent?
		Someone offered a fruit of derision,<br/>
		Knowledge of good and of evil<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="658" href="#">51</a>, cleaving in God a division,<br/>
		Though He who made all, said, “It is good; I have fashioned perfection.”<br/>
		“Nay, there is evil,” someone whispered, “’tis screened from detection.”<br/>
		Wisest he of the beasts of the field, one cunning and creeping.<br/>
		“See it,” he said, “be wise.
		You shall be as the gods are, unsleeping,<br/>
		They who know all,” and they ate.
		The roots of our being were shaken;<br/>
		Hatred and weeping and death at once trampled a world overtaken,<br/>
		Terror and fleeing and wrath and shame and desire unsated;<br/>
		Cruelty stalked like a lion; Revenge and her brood were created.<br/>
		Out to the desert He drove the rebellious.
		Flaming behind them<br/>
		Streamed out the sword of His wrath; it followed, eager to find them,<br/>
		Stabbing at random.
		The pure and the evil, the strong and the tempted,<br/>
		All are confounded in punishment.
		Justly is no one exempted.<br/>
		Virtuous?
		Yes, there are many; but who is there innocent?
		Toiling,<br/>
		Therefore, we seek, but find not that Eden.
		Planting and spoiling,<br/>
		“This is the garden,” we say, “lo, the trees! and this is the river.”<br/>
		Vainly!

		Is it not all His play?

		Whose are the whispers of sweetness?
		Whence are the murmurs of pity?<br/>
		Why are we terrified then, cry out and draw back from the smiting?<br/>
		Blows of a lover, perhaps, intended for fiercer inciting!<br/>

		Headlong, o’ercome with a stridulant horror the river descending<br/>
		Shudders below into sunless depths among chasms unending,–<br/>
		Angry, afraid, white, foaming.
		A stony and monstrous resistance<br/>
		Meets it, piling up stubborn limits, an iron insistence.<br/>

		Sweetly its burden of pity and sorrow, fragrant the flowers,–<br/>
		There in an arbour delightful I know we shall sport with the Hours,<br/>
		Lying on beds of lilies, hearing the bells of our cattle<br/>

		That sings to jasmine-bushes where they dream<br/>
		Dropping their petal kisses on the flood.<br/>
		A mountain purple-vague<br/>
		Wide-watching, half-reclined against the sky,<br/>
		The drowsy earth with its stone-lidded eye,<br/>
		Pressing upon the nearness blue and dense<br/>
		Its shoulder in a mighty indolence.<br/>
		The birds were silent on the unruffled trees;<br/>
		The spotted lizard in a dull-eyed ease<br/>
		Basked on his sentinel-stone; a lonely kite<br/>
		Circled above, half rusty-gold, half-white.<br/>
		Shrill and dissatisfied the wanderer’s sky<br/>
		To an unlistening ear sailed shadowy-high.<br/>
		He saw with absent eyes the ripple-run<br/>
		Of waters curling in the noonday sun.<br/>
		His thoughts were with a face his dreams had seen,<br/>
		And like a floating charm it came between<br/>
		His vision and the jasmines’ virgin glow,<br/>
		Warmer than clusterings of their moon-flaked snow.<br/>
		He listened to a name his dreams had heard<br/>
		Sweeter than passion of a crooning bird.<br/>
		In long and softly-wreathing sounds were twined<br/>
		The delicate syllables yearning through his mind;<br/>
		His beating heart was to their charm compelled.<br/>

		Broke from the blue-stoled secrecy of the hill<br/>
		Such radiance as when softly visible<br/>
		Breaks stealing from a purple-covered breast<br/>
		A lovely glint of whiteness.
		Now, increased,<br/>
		Like a snow-feathered arrow-head it flew<br/>
		Splintering the sapphire with its silvery hue.<br/>
		But before long there gleamed a flame-bright flock<br/>
		Flying like one and breasting with its shock<br/>
		Of faery speed the widenesses of noon.<br/>
		So rapidly the wonder travelled, soon<br/>
		He saw distinct the feathers proud and fine<br/>
		Not only with a splendour argentine,<br/>
		But shaken from the wings was shed a hail<br/>
		Of gold that left the sunbeam’s glory pale.<br/>
		They flew not like the snowy cranes, a wreath<br/>
		Of flowers driven in the rainwind’s breath,<br/>
		But ranked in lovely lines magnificent came<br/>
		Filling the eyes with silver and with flame.<br/>
		They over Nala’s garden flying round<br/>
		Whirring descended with a far-heard sound,<br/>
		A gentle thunder falling sweetly slack<br/>
		As line by line they filled the slumbering lake.<br/>
		A hundred wonderful shapes in mystic crowd<br/>
		Covered the water like a living cloud.<br/>
		Next on the stream they spread their glorious bosoms<br/>
		And preening over the waves like curving blossoms<br/>
		Their long and delicate necks came floating on.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="poems-note">Note</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-990">In some of these poems, as in others of the <em>Six Poems</em>, a quantitative
		metrical system has
		been used which seems to have puzzled some critics, apparently because it does not follow the laws of quantity
		obtaining in the ancient classical languages.
		But those laws are quite alien to the rhythm and sound-structure of the English tongue; the attempt to observe
		them has always ended in deserved and inevitable failure.
		Another system has been followed here which is in agreement with the native rhythm of English speech.
		There what determines the metrical length or brevity of syllables is weight, the weight of the voice emphasis or
		the dwelling of the voice upon the sound.
		Where there is that emphasis or that dwelling of the voice, the syllable may be considered metrically long;
		where both are absent there will be, normally, a recognisable shortness which can only be cured by some aid of
		consonant weight or other lengthening circumstance.
		All stressed syllables are metrically long in English and cannot be otherwise, however short the vowel may be,
		for they dominate the verse movement; this is a fact which is ignored in the traditional account of English
		quantity and which many experimenters in quantitative verse have chosen to disregard with disastrous
		consequences,– all their genius or skill in metrical technique could not save them from failure.
		On the other hand, a long-vowel syllable can be regarded as metrically long even if there is no stress upon it.
		In the quantitative system used in these poems this possibility is converted into a law: metrical length is
		obligatory for all such natural syllabic longs, while a short-vowel syllable unstressed is normally short for
		metrical purposes unless it is very heavily weighted with consonants.
		But the mere occurrence of two or more consonants after a short vowel does not by itself make the syllable long
		as it necessarily does in Greek, Latin or Sanskrit.<br/>
		The system may then be reduced to the following rules:<br/>
		      1. All stressed syllables are regarded as metrically long, as also all syllables supported on a long
		vowel.<br/>
		      2. All short-vowel syllables not stressed are regarded as </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 566</p>
<p class="P" search_id="CP-991">short, unless they are heavily weighted with consonants.
		But on this last point no fixed rule can be given; in each case the ear must be the judge.<br/>
		      3. There are a great number of sounds in English which can be regarded according to circumstances either
		as longs or as shorts.
		Here too the ear must decide in each case.<br/>
		      4. English quantity metres cannot be as rigid as the metres of ancient tongues.
		The rhythm of the language demands a certain variability, free or sparing, without which monotony sets in;
		accordingly in all English metres modulation is admitted as possible.
		Even the most regular rhythms do not altogether shut out the substitution of other feet than those fixed in the
		normal basic arrangement of the line; they admit at least so much as is needed to give the necessary pliancy or
		variety to the movement.
		There is sometimes a very free use of such variations; but they ought not to be allowed to break the basic
		movement or overburden or overlay it.
		The same rule must apply in quantitative metres; especially in long poems modulations are indispensable.<br/>
		This system is not only not at discord with the sound-structure of the language, it accords closely with its
		natural rhythm; it only regulates and intensifies into metrical pitch and tone the cadence that is already there
		even in prose, even in daily speech.
		If we take passages from English literature which were written as prose but with some intensity of rhythm, its
		movement can be at once detected.

		trochee is transferred from the closing flow of trochees to the beginning of the line, the spondee and dactyl
		are pushed into the middle; the last syllable of the closing trochee is most often dropped altogether.
		Classical metres cannot always with success be taken over just as they are into the English rhythm; often some
		modifications are needed to make them more malleable.<br/>
		In “Moon of Two Hemispheres” the strophe antistrophe system has been used: the lines of the stanza differ from
		each other in the nature and order of the feet, no identity or approach to identity is imposed; but each line of
		the antistrophe follows scrupulously the arrangement of the corresponding line of the strophe.
		An occasional modulation at most is allowed, e.g. the substitution of a trochee for a spondee.
		The whole poem, however, in spite of its metrical variations, follows a single general rhythmic movement.<br/>
		“Rose of God”, like a previous poem “In Horis Aeternum”, is written in pure stress metre.
		As stress and high accentual pitch usually coincide, it is possible to scan accentual metre on the stress
		principle and stress metre also can be so written that it can be scanned as accentual verse; but pure stress
		metre depends entirely on stress ictus.
		In ordinary poetry stress and natural syllabic quantity enter in as elements of the rhythm, but are not, qua
		stress and quantity, essential elements of the basic metre: in pure stress metre there is a reversal of these
		values; quantity and accentual inflexion are subordinate and help to build the rhythm, but stress alone
		determines the metrical basis.
		In “Rose of God” each line is composed of six stresses, and the whole poem is built of five stanzas, each
		containing four such lines; the arrangement of feet varies freely to suit the movement of thought and feeling in
		each line.
		Thus,

<p class="P" search_id="CP-1396">I walked beside the waters of a world of light<br/>
		On a gold ridge guarding two seas of high-rayed night.<br/>
		One was divinely topped with a pale bluish moon<br/>
		And swam as in a happy deep spiritual swoon<br/>
		More conscious than earth’s waking; the other’s wide delight<br/>
		Billowed towards an ardent orb of diamond white.<br/>
		But where I stood, there joined in a bright marvellous haze<br/>
		The miracled moons with the long ridge’s golden blaze.<br/>
		I knew not if two wakings or two mighty sleeps<br/>
		Mixed the great diamond fires and the pale pregnant deeps,<br/>
		But all my glad expanding soul flowed satisfied<br/>
		Around me and became the mystery of their tide.<br/>
		As one who finds his own eternal self, content,<br/>
		Needing naught else beneath the spirit’s firmament,<br/>
		It knew not Space, it heard no more Time’s running feet,<br/>
		Termless, fulfilled, lost richly in itself, complete.<br/>
		And so it might have lain for ever.

		Its changing mind was time, its heart eternity.<br/>
		All opposites were there, unreconciled, uneased,<br/>
		Struggling for victory, by victory unappeased.<br/>
		All things it bore, even that which brings undying peace,<br/>
		But secret, veiled, waiting for some supreme release.<br/>

		A Voice arose that was so sweet and terrible<br/>
		It thrilled the heart with love and pain, as if all hell<br/>
		Tuned with all heaven in one inextricable note.<br/>

		It carried all sorrow that the souls of creatures share,<br/>
		Yet hinted every rapture that the gods can bear.<br/>

		To sound and know its gulfs and bring the immortal light<br/>
		Into the passion of its darkness, castst thou man’s fate<br/>
		For thy soul’s freedom and its magic are forfeit,<br/>
		Renouncing the high pain that gave thee mortal birth<br/>
		And made thy soul a seeker on the common earth?<br/>
		When first the Eternal cast Himself abroad to be<br/>
		His own unimaginable multiplicity,<br/>
		Expressing in Time and shape what timelessly was there,<br/>
		The mighty Mother stood alone in diamond air<br/>
		And took into her that Godhead streaming from above<br/>
		And worlds of her endless beauty and delight and love<br/>
		Leaped from her fathomless heart.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn-1008-1"><sup>1</sup>No title in the manuscript. April 1934. Sri Aurobindo wrote the
			first part of this poem (down to “gloried fields of trance”) on 25 April 1934 after Dilip Kumar Roy asked
			him for some lines in alexandrines (Sri Aurobindo Came to Me, pp. 226-29).In an accompanying letter, he
			explained how the caesura dividing the lines into two parts could come after different syllables. Dilip,
			noting that in Sri Aurobindo's passage there were examples of the caesura falling after the second, fourth,
			fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth syllables, asked for an example of a line with the caesura
			coming after the third syllable. Sri Aurobindo obliged by sending him the couplet:

			And in the silence of the mind life knows itself
			Immortal, and immaculately grows divine.

			On 28 April 1934, three days after Sri Aurobindo sent the first passage, his secretary asked him: “Can your
			last poem (in Alexandrines, sent to Dilip) be put into circulation?” Sri Aurobindo replied: “No. It is not
			even half finished.” He wrote two more passages but never wove the three together into a completed poem. The
			editors have reproduced the passages as they are found in Sri Aurobindo's notebooks and loose sheets,
			separating the three passages by blank lines.</p>

<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-297">Sri Aurobindo once wrote that he was “a poet and a
		politician” first, and only afterwards a philosopher. One might add that he was
		a poet before he entered politics and a poet after he ceased to write about
		politics or philosophy. His first published work, written apparently towards the
		end of 1882, was a short poem. The last writing work he did, towards the end of
		1950, was revision of the epic poem <em>Savitri</em>. The results of these
		sixty-eight years of poetic output are collected in the present volume, with the
		exception of <em>Savitri</em>, dramatic poetry, poetic translations, and poems
		written in Bengali and Sanskrit. These appear, respectively, in <em>Savitri: A
			Legend and a Symbol</em>, <em>Collected Plays and Stories</em>, <em>Translations</em>,
		and <em>Writings in Bengali and Sanskrit</em>, volumes 33 – 34, 3 – 4, 5, and 9 of <span class="D_NAME_1">
			The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo</span>.<br/>
		The poems in the present volume have been arranged in
		seven chronological parts. The dates of the parts overlap because some of the
		books that define each period contain poems from a wide range of dates. Within
		each part, poems from books published by the author are followed by complete and
		incomplete poems published posthumously. Poems that appeared in books published by Sri
		Aurobindo during his lifetime are arranged as they were in those books.
		Otherwise, poems within each section of each part are arranged chronologically.
		Poems written in Greek and in French appear in an appendix at the end of the
		volume.</p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="part-one-england-and-baroda-1883-1898">Part One: England and Baroda, 1883 – 1898</h1>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-298">Sri Aurobindo went to England as a child of seven in
		1879. He lived in Manchester until 1884, when he went to London to study at St.
		Paul’s School. From there he went to Cambridge in 1890. Three years later he
		returned to India, and until 1906 lived and worked in the princely state of
		Baroda. He began writing poetry in Manchester, and continued </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 692</p>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-299">in London,
		Cambridge and Baroda. His first collection, published in Baroda in 1898,
		contained poems written in England and Baroda. This collection is reproduced in
		the present part, along with other poems written during these years.</p>
<h2 class="sub-hd" id="poem-published-in-1883">Poem Published in 1883</h2>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-300"><b>Light</b>. Published 1883. Asked in 1939, “When did you
		begin to write poetry?”, Sri Aurobindo replied: “When my two brothers and I were
		staying at Manchester. I wrote for the Fox family magazine. It was an awful
		imitation of somebody I don’t remember.” The only English journal having a name
		resembling “the Fox family magazine” is <em>Fox’s Weekly</em>, which first
		appeared on 11 January 1883 and was suspended the following November. Published
		from Leeds, it catered to the middle and working classes of that industrial
		town. A total of nine poems appeared in <em>Fox’s Weekly</em> during its brief
		existence. All but one of them are coarse adult satires. The exception is
		“Light”, published in the issue of 11 January 1883. Like all other poems in <em>
			Fox’s Weekly</em>, “Light” is unsigned, but there can be no doubt that it was the
		poem to which Sri Aurobindo referred when he said that his first verses were
		published in “the Fox family magazine”. The poem’s stanza is an imitation of the
		one used by P. B. Shelley in the well-known lyric “The Cloud”. Sri Aurobindo
		remarked in 1926 that as a child in Manchester, he went through the works of
		Shelley again and again. He also wrote that he read the Bible “assiduously”
		while living in the house of his guardian, William H. Drewett, a
		Congregationalist clergyman.</p>
<h2 class="sub-hd" id="songs-to-myrtilla"><b><em>Songs to Myrtilla</em></b></h2>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-301">This, Sri Aurobindo’s first collection of poems, was
		printed in 1898 for private circulation by the Lakshmi Vilas Printing Press,
		Baroda, under the title <em>Songs to Myrtilla and Other Poems</em>. No copy of the
		first edition survives. The second edition, which was probably a reimpression of
		the first, is undated. The date of publication must therefore be inferred from
		other evidence. The book’s handwritten manuscript, as well as the second
		edition, contains the poem “Lines on Ireland”, dated 1896. The second edition contains a translation from
		Chandidasa that almost </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 693</p>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-302">certainly was done using an edition of Chandidasa’s
		works published in 1897. On 17 October 1898, Sri Aurobindo’s brother Manmohan
		wrote in a letter to Rabindranath Tagore: “My brother . . . has just published a
		volume of poems at Baroda.” This book evidently is <em>Songs to Myrtilla</em>. In
		another letter Manmohan tells Tagore: “Aurobinda is anxious to know what you
		think of his book of verses.” This second letter is dated 24 October 1894, but
		the year clearly is wrong. Manmohan had not even returned to India from England
		by that date. When the two letters are read together and when other documentary
		evidence is evaluated, it becomes clear that the second letter also was written
		in 1898, and that this was the year of publication of the first edition of Songs
		to Myrtilla.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="1056" href="#">1</a> The “second edition” apparently appeared a year or
		two
		later.<br/>
		A new edition of the book, entitled simply <em>Songs to
			Myrtilla</em>, was published by the Arya Publishing House, Calcutta, in April
		1923.<br/>
		When a biographer suggested during the 1940s that all
		the poems in <em>Songs to Myrtilla</em> were written in Baroda, except for five
		that were written in England, Sri Aurobindo corrected him as follows: “It is the
		other way round; all the poems in the book were written in England except five
		later ones which were written after his return to India.” The following poems certainly were written in Baroda
		after his return to India in 1893: “Lines on Ireland” (dated 1896), “Saraswati
		with the Lotus” and “Bankim Chandra Chatterji” (both written after the death of
		Bankim in 1894), and “To the Cuckoo” (originally subtitled “A Spring morning in
		India”). “Madhusudan Dutt” was probably also written in Baroda, as were the two
		adaptations of poems by Chandidasa. This makes seven poems. The number five,
		proposed by the biographer and not by Sri Aurobindo, was probably not meant by
		Sri Aurobindo to be taken as an exact figure.<br/>
		The handwritten manuscript of <em>Songs to Myrtilla</em>
		contains one poem, “The Just Man”, that was not printed in any edition of the
		book. (It is reproduced here in the third section of Part One.) The manuscript

<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-371"><em>Ahana and Other Poems</em> was published in 1915. It
		consists of the long poem <em>Ahana</em>, written in Pondicherry, and twenty-four
		shorter poems, most of which were written in Baroda. Sometime after 1915, Sri
		Aurobindo wrote in his copy of the book, “Written mostly between 1895 and 1908,
		first published at Pondicherry in 1915.” This inscription shows a degree of
		uncertainty: “1895” was written over “1900”, while “1908” was written over
		“1907”. Neither of the dates, written more than a decade after the poems, need
		be considered exact. Surviving manuscript drafts of these poems do not
		appear to be earlier than 1900. Near-final drafts of many of them are found in a
		typed manuscript that may be dated to 1904 – 6. When Sri Aurobindo looked over
		these poems in 1942 while his <em>Collected Poems and Plays</em> was being
		arranged, he commented: “I find that most of the poems are quite early in
		Baroda, others later on and others in the second period [<em>of poems in the
			book, i.e. 1906 – 9</em>]. It would be a pity to break up these poems, as they
		form a natural group by themselves.” In the present volume, these twenty-four
		poems are published in a single group, while “Ahana” is published along with

		carried a number of satirical poems, most of which were the work of Sri
		Aurobindo’s colleague Shyam Sundar Chakravarti. This piece is the exception. Sri
		Aurobindo remembered writing it in 1942 when his poems were being collected for
		publication in <em>Collected Poems and Plays</em>. (It was not published in that
		collection because the file of the daily <em>Bande Mataram</em> was not then
		available.) Later the poem was independently ascribed to Sri Aurobindo by
		Hemendra Prasad Ghose, another <em>Bande Mataram</em> editor and writer, who was
		in a way responsible for its composition. In his report on the session of the
		Bengal Provincial Conference held in Behrampore in 1907, Hemendra Prasad wrote
		that the chairman of the Reception Committee, a loyalist named Srinath Paul (who
		bore the honourary British title Rai Bahadoor), finished his address “perspiring
		and short of breath” (<em>Bande Mataram</em>, 2 April 1907). This phrase moved Sri
		Aurobindo to write this amusing piece of political satire. It was published
		under the heading “By the Way”, which was the headline he used for his
		occasional column in <em>Bande Mataram</em>. The same words were used in place of
		a signature at the end.</p>

		Aurobindo went to Bengal and openly joined the national movement in February
		1906, but he had been active behind the scenes for some years before that. A

		1902 to around 1910. The handwriting of this draft is that of the later years in
		Baroda (1904 – 6), and it is probable the poem was written during that period.
		(Sri Aurobindo spent a good deal of time in Bengal during these years.) <em>Baji
			Prabhou</em> was published for the first time in three issues of the <em>

		of this revision subsequently. In 1922 he published the <em>Karmayogin</em> text
		(with new, very light, revision) at the Modern Press, Pondicherry. This text
		became the basis of a further revised version published in <em>Collected Poems

		the police in 1908 and never returned. There were, however, two draft passages
		of the poem in a notebook that Sri Aurobindo had with him in 1909 – 10, and he
		apparently drew on these to write <em>Chitrangada</em>. Many of the lines in the
		final version are identical or almost identical to those in the draft passages.
		Sometime before he left Bengal in February 1910, he gave the manuscript of <em>
			Chitrangada</em> to the <em>Karmayogin</em> staff for publication. The poem
		appeared in that newspaper in the issues of 26 March and 2 April 1910. “To be
		continued” was printed at the end of the second instalment, but the issue in
		which it appeared was the last to come out. The manuscript of the rest of the
		poem has been lost. Around 1930, one of Sri Aurobindo’s disciples typed the
		incomplete poem out from the <em>Karmayogin</em> and sent it to Sri Aurobindo, who
		expressed some dissatisfaction with it. In 1937 he indicated that the poem
		required some revision before it could be published, but that it was “not the
		moment” for that. More than a decade later, he revised <em>Chitrangada</em> for
		publication in the 1949 number of the <em>Sri Aurobindo Circle</em> annual. The
		following note was printed along with the <em>Circle</em> text: “Sri Aurobindo had
		completed this poem but the original has been lost, only this fragment remains.
		It has been revised for publication.” The revision considerably enlarged the
		passage containing the speech of Chitrangada’s “dying sire”. The new lines
		appear to be the last poetical lines Sri Aurobindo composed, with the exception
		of the final revisions and additions to <em>Savitri</em>.</p>

		February 1910, Sri Aurobindo left Calcutta for Chandernagore, where he remained

		contents of the manuscript) were published in the <em>Standard Bearer</em>, a
		journal brought out from Chandernagore. Sometime after their publication, Sri
		Aurobindo revised the <em>Standard Bearer</em> texts. In 1942, the <em>Standard Bearer</em> versions were
		given to Sri Aurobindo for further revision before inclusion in <em>Collected

<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-426"><b>Ilion</b>. Sri Aurobindo began work on this epic in

		of the poem – then entitled “The Fall of Troy: An Epic” – were dated by the
		author as follows: “Commenced in jail, 1909, resumed and completed in
		Pondicherry, April and May 1910.” Between then and 1914, he worked steadily on
		this “completed” poem, transforming it from a brief narrative into an epic made
		up of several books. During the first stage of this enlargement, between April
		1910 and March 1913, he produced almost a dozen drafts of the first book and a
		smaller number of drafts of the second. In March 1913, a sudden fluency
		permitted him to complete and revise a version of the epic extending up to the
		end of what is now Book VIII. He wrote the fragmentary ninth book (untitled and
		not actually headed “Book IX” in the manuscript) in 1914. Probably before then,
		he copied out the first eight books into notebooks that bear the title <em>Ilion</em>.
		Subsequently he revised and recopied the completed books, or passages from them,
		several times. This work continued until around 1917. It would appear
		that two </p>
<p class="p-num">Page 708</p>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-427">factors – the writing-load of the monthly journal <em>Arya</em>
		(1914 – 21) and the attention demanded by his other epic, <em>Savitri</em> –

		intended to be a twelve-book epic.</p>
<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-428">During the twenties and thirties, Sri Aurobindo

		day, “<span class="str_citata">in another three years <em>Savitri</em> and <em>Ilion</em> and I don’t know
			how much more would all be rewritten, finished, resplendently complete</span>”. He in

		opening of the first book to serve as an illustration of the quantitative
		hexameter in “On Quantitative Metre”, an essay that was published in <em>
			Collected Poems and Plays</em> in 1942 and also in a separate booklet issued the
		same year. This revised passage of 371 lines was the only portion of <em>Ilion</em>
		to appear in print during his lifetime. The full text was transcribed from his
		manuscripts and published in 1957. A new edition, corrected against the

		of a long dialogue between Ahana and “Voices”; the second consists of a speech
		by Ahana, a speech by “A Voice”, and a final speech by Ahana. In the final draft
		of “The Descent”, the last two speeches of the second part comprise 160 lines.
		In or before 1915, Sri Aurobindo revised and enlarged these 160 lines into the
		171-line poem that was published in <em>Ahana and Other Poems</em>. In this
		version, Sri Aurobindo added a head-note setting the scene of the poem and a
		footnote glossing the term “Ras”. Sometime after 1915, he revised the 1915 text,
		but apparently forgot about this revision, which has never been published. In or
		before 1942, he again revised the 1915 text for publication in <em>Collected

		days of wrestling I have to admit that I am beaten by your last metre. I have
		written something, but it is a fake.” He then wrote out the first stanza of the

		did write a second stanza later. The poem was published in the “Sri Aurobindo

		“Rose of God” was ready “on the 30th having been written on that and the
		previous day”. On 31 December, he wrote to his secretary that the just-typed
		“Rose of God” could be “circulated first as a sort of New Year invocation”. On 2
		March 1935, his secretary wrote to him saying that the editor of a quarterly
		journal had asked for a poem to be published, and asking whether “Rose of God”

<p class="Pn" search_id="CP-577">Sri Aurobindo wrote most of these pieces in a somewhat

		Kumar Roy. As Dilip writes in <em>Sri Aurobindo Came to Me</em>, p. 233: “At the
		time I was transposing some English modulations into our Bengali verse which he
		[Sri Aurobindo] greatly appreciated in so much that, to encourage me, he
		composed short poems now and then as English counterparts to my Bengali bases.”
		One such experiment resulted in the poem “Thought the Paraclete”, which Sri
		Aurobindo later revised and included in the book <em>Poems</em> (see above). All
		but one of the others exist in one or more drafts in Sri Aurobindo’s notebooks
		of the period. The exception, “In some faint dawn”, is known only by the text
		published by Dilip in <em>Sri Aurobindo Came to Me</em>. The nine poems published
		in that book are reproduced here in the same order. Another poem written in
		response to a letter from Dilip is placed before the rest, while two others,
		also metrical experiments, have been placed at the end of Dilip’s set. All the

		some lines in alexandrines (<em>Sri Aurobindo Came to Me</em>, pp. 226 – 29). In
		an accompanying letter, he explained how the caesura dividing the lines into two
		parts could come after different syllables. Dilip, noting that in Sri
		Aurobindo’s passage there were examples of the caesura falling after the second,
		fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth syllables, asked for an
		example of a line with the caesura coming after the third syllable. Sri

		“No. It is not even half finished.” He wrote two more passages but never wove

		held at Cambridge that month. In order to win this scholarship, candidates had
		to take twelve papers over the course of a week. One of the papers required

		Carlton (born circa 1558), an English madrigal composer:</p><br/>
