      This volume contains the Mother’s correspondence with fourteen persons; all but one of them were members of the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. The material covers a forty-five year period, from 1927 to 1972. The earliest items are letters of the Mother to her son; the latest are brief thoughts and prayers written in a young disciple’s notebook. Each of the correspondences is presented in chronological order, with the exception of Series Six, which is arranged by theme. Two correspondences were written in English; twelve were written wholly or partly in French and appear here in translation. Further information is provided in the Note on the Texts.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 11">Our community is growing more and more; we are nearly thirty (not counting those who are scattered all over India); and I have become responsible for all this; I am at the centre of the organisation, on the material as well as the spiritual side, and you can easily imagine what it means. We already occupy five houses, one of which is our property; others will follow. New recruits are coming from all parts of the world. With this expansion, new activities are being created, new needs are arising which require new skills.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 13">I think I told you about our five houses; four of them are joined in a single square block which is surrounded on all sides by streets and contains several buildings with courtyards and gardens. We have just bought, repaired and comfortably furnished one of these houses and then, just recently, we have settled there, Sri Aurobindo and myself, as well as five of the closest disciples.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 14">We have joined the houses together with openings in some of the outer walls and outbuildings, so that I may walk freely in our little realm without having to go out into the street — this is rather nice. But I am busier than ever now, and I can say that at the moment I am writing to you in a hurry.</p>

But I do give my body the rest it needs, that is, two or three hours of lying down in a condition of absolute immobility in which the whole being, mental, psychic, vital and physical, enters into a complete state of rest made of perfect peace, absolute silence and total immobility, while the consciousness remains perfectly awake; or else I enter into an internal activity of one or more states of being, an activity which constitutes the occult work and which, needless to say, is also perfectly conscious. So I can say, in all truth, that I never lose consciousness throughout the twenty-four hours, which thus form an unbroken sequence, and that I no longer experience ordinary sleep, while still giving my body the rest that it needs.</p>

Moreover, these “conversations” make no claim to exhaust their subjects or even to deal with them thoroughly.

We have now acquired our twenty-first house; the number of paid workers of the Ashram (labourers and servants) has reached sixty or sixty-five, and the number of Ashram members (Sri Aurobindo’s disciples living in Pondicherry) varies between eighty-five and a hundred. Five cars, twelve bicycles, four sewing machines, a dozen typewriters, many garages, an automobile repair workshop, an electrical service, a building service, sewing departments (European and Indian tailors, embroideresses, etc.), a library and reading-room containing several thousand volumes, a photographic service, general stores containing a wide variety of goods, nearly all imported from France, large gardens for flowers, vegetables and fruits, a dairy, a bakery, etc., etc.! — you can see that it is no small affair. And as I am taking care of all this, I can truly say that I am busy.</p>

On the contrary it is outside India that they are most popular; and for foreigners these two men seem to be the only ones who represent Indian genius. This is very far from the truth, and if they are so well known in Western countries, it is probably because their stature does not go beyond the understanding of the Western mind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 26">India has far greater geniuses than these and in the most varied fields, scientific, literary, philosophic, spiritual. It is true that the young people from Shantiniketan come out refined, but without any force or energy for realisation. As for Gandhi’s young people, they may have more energy and power of action, but they are imprisoned within the four walls of a few narrow ideas and a limited mind.</p>

I have never denied this, but I wish to add that there is nothing to fear in this respect; if it is Nature’s plan to perpetuate the human race, she will always find as many people as she needs to carry out her plan. The earth will surely never suffer from a dearth of men.</p>

Oh, the horror of falsehood spread everywhere on earth, ruling the world with its law of darkness! I believe that its reign has lasted long enough; this is the master we must now refuse to serve.

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 35">After a very long time I was happy to receive your letter of January 5th, especially since you think of Pondicherry as an ideal resting place. True, I think that it could provide a perfect place of cure for the restless — even if one seeks diversions there are none; on the other hand the sea is beautiful, the countryside is vast and the town is very small: a five minute drive and you are out of it; and, at the centre of it all, the Ashram is a condensation of dynamic and active peace, so much so that all those who come from outside feel as if they were in another world. It is indeed something of another world, a world in which the inner life governs the outer, a world where things get done, where work is carried out not for a personal end but in a selfless way for the realisation of an ideal. The life we lead here is as far from ascetic abstinence as from an enervating comfort; simplicity is the rule here, but a simplicity full of variety — a variety of occupations, of activities, of tastes, tendencies, natures; each one is free to organise his life as he pleases, the discipline is reduced</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 37">I would like to show you our "establishment". It has just acquired four houses which I bought in my name to simplify the legal technicalities; but it goes without saying that <em>I do not own them</em>. I think I have already explained the situation to you and I want to take advantage of this opportunity to remind you of it. The Ashram with all its real estate and moveable property belongs to Sri Aurobindo, it is his money that enables me to meet the almost formidable expenses that it entails (our annual budget averages one "lakh" of rupees, which at the present rate of exchange corresponds approximately to 650,000 francs); and if my name sometimes appears (on bank accounts, purchase of houses, of automobiles, etc.), it is, as I already told you, a matter of convenience for the papers and signatures, since it is I who "manage" everything, but not because I really own them. You will readily understand why I am telling you all this; it is so you can bear it in mind just in case.</p>

In their ignorant unconsciousness men set moving forces they are not even aware of and soon these forces get more and more out of their control and bring about disastrous results. The earth seems to be shaken almost entirely by a terrible fit of political and social epilepsy through which the most dangerous forces of destruction do their work. Even here, in this poor little nook, we have not escaped the general malady. For three or four days the forces at work were ugly and could justifiably cause anxiety, and a great confusion</p>

<p class="PE">and diplomacy were used, but on the other hand, behind every human will there are forces at work whose origin is not human and which move consciously towards certain ends. The play of these forces is very complex and generally eludes the human consciousness; but for ease of explanation and understanding, they may be divided into two main opposing tendencies: those that work for the fulfilment of the Divine work upon earth, and those that are opposed to this fulfilment. The former have few conscious instruments at their disposal. It is true that in this matter quality compensates by far for quantity. As for the anti-divine forces they have only too many to choose from, and always they find wills which they enslave and individuals whom they turn into docile but nearly always unconscious puppets. Hitler is a choice instrument for these anti-divine forces which want violence, upheaval and war, for they know that these things retard and hamper the action of the divine forces. That is why disaster was very close even though no human government consciously wanted it. But at any cost there was to be no war and that is why war has been avoided — for the time being.</p>

These atmospheres act and react on each other by contagion; the vibrations are contagious; that is to say, we readily pick up the vibration of someone we meet, especially if that vibration is at all strong. So it is easy to understand that someone who carries in and around himself peace and goodwill, will in a way impose on others at least something of his peace and goodwill, whereas scorn, irritability and anger will arouse similar movements in others.

He looked at me in bewilderment and explained that in mechanics the longer the pendulum is, the slower the movement.

One should also be aware of what is good and true in the nature and give it all one’s attention, so that this good and true side can grow and ultimately absorb the rest and transform the nature.</p>

Are you aware that you are making a great deal of progress? I like the envelopes that <em>both of us are painting together</em> very much, and that is one more proof that we are doing them together, because they are nearly always just as I thought they should be. The small one you sent this morning is very fine and the choice of colours is excellent.</p>

At your age I was exclusively occupied with my studies — finding things out, learning, understanding, knowing. That was my interest, even my passion. My mother, who loved us very much — my brother and myself — never allowed us to be ill tempered or discontented or lazy. If we went to complain to her about one thing or another, to tell her that we were discontented, she would make fun of us or scold us and say, “What is this nonsense? Don’t be ridiculous. Quick! Off you go and work, and never mind whether you are in a good or a bad mood! That is of no interest at all.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 948">You tell me in your letter: “Mother, I do not want the world, not because I am afraid of my duty but because I want you.” I would like to tell you something about this. To be sure that you are meant for the Ashram life, it is necessary that the spiritual life and all the discipline it entails — in short, the search for and realisation of the Divine — must be the most important thing to you, the only thing worth living for.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1624">It is through all the experiences of life that the psychic personality forms, grows, develops and finally becomes a complete, conscious and free being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1625">This process of development goes on tirelessly through innumerable lives, and if one is not conscious of it, it is because one is not conscious of one’s psychic being — for that is the indispensable starting-point.

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1626">In order to strengthen the contact and aid, if possible, the development of the conscious psychic personality, one should, while concentrating, turn towards it, aspire to know it and feel it, open oneself to receive its influence, and take great care, each time that one receives an indication from it, to follow it very scrupulously and sincerely. To live in a great aspiration, to take care to become inwardly calm and remain so always as far as possible, to cultivate a perfect sincerity in all the activities of one’s being — these are the essential conditions for the growth of the psychic being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1643">Naturally, this is not the opinion of the ego, which thinks it knows better than anyone else what it needs, and claims for itself independence of judgment and decision.

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1677">The physical consciousness is not only the consciousness of our body, but of all that surrounds us as well — all that we perceive with our senses. It is a sort of apparatus for recording and transmission which is open to all the contacts and shocks coming from outside and responds to them by reactions of pleasure and pain which welcome or repel. This makes in our outer being a constant activity and noise that we are only partially aware of, because we are so accustomed to them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1678">But if through meditation or concentration we turn inward or upward, we can bring down into ourselves or raise up from the depths calm, quiet, peace and finally silence. It is a concrete, positive silence (not the negative silence of the absence of noise), immutable so long as it remains, a silence one can experience even in the outer tumult of a hurricane or battlefield. This silence is synonymous with peace and it is all-powerful; it is the perfectly effective remedy for the fatigue, tension and exhaustion arising from that internal over-activity and noise which generally escape our control and cease neither by day nor night.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1686">To read my books is not difficult because they are written in the simplest language, almost the spoken language. To get help from them, it is enough to read with attention and concentration and an attitude of inner good-will, with a desire to receive and live what is taught.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1687">To read what Sri Aurobindo writes is more difficult because the expression is highly intellectual and the language far more literary and philosophic. The brain needs a preparation to really be able to understand and generally this preparation takes time, unless one is specially gifted with an innate intuitive faculty.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1688">In any case, I always advise reading <em>a little</em> at a time, keeping the mind as quiet as one can, without making an effort to understand, but keeping the head as silent as possible and letting <em>the force</em> contained in what one reads <em>enter deep inside.</em> This force, received in calm and silence, will do its work of illumining and will create in the brain, if necessary, the cells required for understanding.

The soul itself, being a portion of the Divine, is above all moral and ethical notions; it bathes in the Divine Light and manifests it, but it can truly govern the whole being only when the ego has been dissolved.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q">Sweet Mother,<br/><em>On the night of Friday the 8th, I had a very peculiar dream. As I could not tell it to You at the Playground, I am going to tell You now.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>It was a very fine day—very special. There was an important meeting at the Playground, so I was hurrying there. But near the Playground in front of Standard Stores, the road was covered with innumerable snakes. I was taken aback and rather afraid. So I was about to go round by another way to the Playground. But just then something spoke to me within: "What! Are you afraid of snakes? Come, take courage and walk through them. They will not harm you." I walked through them quite confidently. Not one of them disturbed me nor did I disturb them. When I reached the Playground, I started talking to a friend. Suddenly he jumped back in fright and said: "Be careful, there is a snake coiled around your arm, and another around your other arm, and others around your legs and ankles." Though I had not felt their presence till then, I was not in the least alarmed. I took them off one by one and threw them away. One snake was dead because I had stepped on it.</em></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>This is all I can remember clearly. I cannot remember exactly what happened at the Playground afterwards.</em></p></blockquote>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 1823">The dream is indeed very interesting. Snakes usually signify bad thoughts or bad will from people around you — or an adverse attack that can manifest as an illness. But, as you clearly experienced in your dream, if you are not frightened and go on your way unperturbed, nothing bad will happen to you.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 2080">Since the most ancient times, each system of yoga has developed its own discipline in all its details. All that can be studied, learned and practised. But according to Sri Aurobindo's teaching, each of these practices has its limitations and gives only a partial result. That is why he advised those who want to follow the integral yoga to find their <em>own</em> discipline, based on the ancient knowledge but adapted to the needs and the condition of each individual.</p>

Moreover, there are many different kinds of sensitivity: some stem from weakness, others — the best — are the result of refinement. The ego generally governs the development of the individual, but the most developed individualities are not necessarily those in whom the ego is strongest — on the contrary. As the individuality perfects itself, the power of the ego diminishes, and indeed it is by perfecting himself that the individual arrives at that state of divinisation which liberates him from the ego.</p>

<p class="Q">Sweet mother,<br/>How can one know whether we are progressing or not, individually and collectively?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 2109">It is always preferable not to try to assess the progress one is making because it does not help one to make it — on the contrary. Aspiration for progress, if it is SINCERE, is sure to have an effect. But whatever the progress made, individually or collectively, the progress still remaining to be made is so considerable that there is no reason to stop on the way to assess the ground one has covered.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 2110">The perception that some progress has been made should come spontaneously, by the sudden and unexpected awareness of what one is in comparison with what one was some time before.

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 2112">The advance is rarely in a straight and continuous line because a human being is made up of many different parts, and generally one part or another progresses in its turn while the other parts remain quiescent until their turn comes. It is only when the consciousness grows enough to have an overall view that one can see exactly what is happening. But in order to be sure of advancing progressively and regularly, one must always keep alive the flame of one’s aspiration.</p>

Human nature is made up of imperfections, even its righteousness and virtue are pretensions, imperfections and prancings of self-approbatory egoism.... What is aimed at by us is a spiritual truth as the basis of life, the first words of which are surrender and union with the Divine and the transcendence of ego. So long as that basis is not established, a sadhak is only an ignorant and imperfect human being struggling with the evils of the lower nature....

Not in Europe anyway. But even here, there are quite a number who by tradition have a “family deity”, yet it doesn’t bother them at all to take their deity and throw it into the Ganges when they get displeased! It does happen — I know some people who did it. They had a family Kali in their house, they actually did take her and throw her into the Ganges because they were displeased with her.

<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 2355">I don’t know — believe in the Divine? One thirsts for a certain perfection, perhaps even to transcend oneself, to arrive at something higher than what one is; if one is a philanthropist, one has an aspiration that mankind should become better, or less unhappy, less miserable; all sorts of things like that. One can practise yoga for that, but that is not believing. To believe is to have the faith that there cannot be a world without the Divine, that the very existence of the world proves the existence of the Divine. And not just a “belief”, not something one has thought out or been taught, nothing like that: faith. A faith that is a living knowledge, not an acquired one, that the existence of the world is enough to prove the Divine. Without the Divine, no world. And this is so obvious, you see, that one has the impression that in order to think otherwise, one has to be a bit dense.

We call it the Divine—the Divine is tiny! (<em>Mother laughs.</em>) For me existence is an incontestable proof that there is... that there is nothing but That—something we cannot name, cannot define, cannot describe, but something we can feel and can more and more become. A Something that is more perfect than all the perfections, more beautiful than all the beauties, more marvellous than all the marvels, so that even the totality of all that exists cannot express it.

Finally he told me that he had no opinion on the subject. "My business," he said, "is to write." And he asked me what my "business" was.

The fourteen correspondences in this volume were first brought out separately in books and journals published by the Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Most of them appeared either in the <em>Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education</em>, a bi-lingual quarterly in French and English, or in <em>Mother India</em> , a monthly in English. The correspondences were first published together in English in 1987 in the first edition of this volume. They were first published together in French in 1994 under the title <em>Quelques réponses de la Mère - 1</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 3097">Twelve of these correspondences were written wholly or partly in French; two were written entirely in English. The original translations of material in French were revised for publication in 1987 in the first edition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 3098">In five correspondences some part of the originally published material has been removed — namely the Mother’s brief words of encouragement or solicitude (unless they occur within a longer reply), her comments and decisions on mundane affairs (unless they indicate her viewpoint or way of working), and any replies of little general interest. In two of the series, hitherto unpublished material has been added.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Some Answers from the Mother - 3099">The texts of this second edition (2003) are the same as those of the first edition, except for the correction of typographical errors and the revision of a few translations.</p>
