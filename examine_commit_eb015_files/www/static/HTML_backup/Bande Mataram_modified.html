<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Publisher’s Note</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1">These volumes include Sri Aurobindo’s surviving 
political writings and speeches from the years 1890 to 1908. His political 
writings and speeches from the years after 1908 are published in <i>Karmayogin: 
Political Writings and Speeches 1909 – 1910</i>, volume 8 of The Complete Works 
of Sri Aurobindo.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2">The present volumes consist primarily of articles 
originally published in the nationalist newspaper <i>Bande Mataram</i> between 
August 1906 and May 1908. None of the articles that Sri Aurobindo and his 
colleagues contributed to the <i>Bande Mataram</i> were signed. The 353 articles 
published here have been ascribed to Sri Aurobindo by the editors for a variety 
of reasons. For 56 of them there exists documentary evidence that establishes 
his authorship conclusively; 107 others may be assigned to him with considerable 
confidence; the other 190 are more likely to be by him than by any other <i>
Bande Mataram</i> writer. Details on the materials and methodology of the 
selection are given in the Note on the Texts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 3">These volumes also include political articles written 
by Sri Aurobindo before the start of the <i>Bande Mataram</i>, speeches 
delivered by him between 1907 and 1908, articles from manuscripts of that period 
that he did not publish during his lifetime, and an interview of 1908. Many of 
these writings were not prepared by Sri Aurobindo for publication; several were 
left in an unfinished state. Editorial problems arising from illegibility, etc., 
are indicated by means of the system explained in the Guide to Editorial 
Notation on the next page.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 21"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>A great critic has pronounced that the aim of all truly helpful criticism is to see the object as it really is.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Press is the sole contemporary critic of politics, and according as its judgments are sound or unsound, the people whose political ideas it forms, will be likely to prosper or fail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is therefore somewhat unfortunate that the tendency of journalists should be to see the object not as it really is, but as they would like it to be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In a country like England this may not greatly matter; but in India, whose destinies are in the balance, and at a time when a straw might turn the scale, it is of the gravest importance that no delusion, however specious or agreeable, should be allowed to exist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Yet in the face of this necessity, the Indian Press seems eager to accept even the flimsiest excuse for deluding itself.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 22"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>If we want a striking example of this, we need only turn to the recent vote in the House of Commons on the subject of simultaneous examinations for the Civil Service of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>On this occasion a chorus of jubilant paeans arose from the Press, resembling nothing so much as the joyful chorus of ducks when the monsoon arrives.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Had then some political monsoon arrived raining down justice and happiness on this parched and perishing country?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>What was the fountain-head from which this torrent of dithyrambs derived its being?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Was it a solemn and deliberate pronouncement by the assembled representatives of the English nation that the time was now come to do justice to India?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Was it a resolution gravely arrived at in a full House, that the cruel burden of taxation which has exhausted our strength, must be alleviated without delay?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Or was it a responsible pledge by a person in authority that the high-sounding promises of ’58 should at last become something more than a beautiful chimera?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>No, it was simply a chance vote snatched by a dexterous minority from a meagre and listless House.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>As a fine tactical success it reflects </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8</p>
<p class="PE"> every credit on the acuteness and <i> savoir faire</i> of our friends in Parliament, but no more expresses the real feeling of the English people than a decree of the Chinese Emperor would express it.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 23"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The vote was by no means a mandate of the British Parliament, as some have sonorously phrased it; it was merely a pious opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It will have to meet not only the bitter antagonism of the Indian Government, but the opposition, open or veiled, of a vast majority in the Commons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>How then can it possibly be enforced?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Can our handful of philo-Indian members help to eject a Government that will not ratify its empty triumph?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It would be too absurd even to dream of such a thing: and even if any of them were so impossibly rash, their constituencies would quickly teach them that they were sent to Parliament to support Mr. Gladstone and not to do justice to India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The vote is nothing but a tactical advantage; and yet on this flimsy basis we have chosen to erect the most imposing castles in the air.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Yet if this were an isolated instance of blindness, it might be allowed to pass without comment; but it is only one more example of a grave illusion that possesses the Indian mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>We constantly find it asserted that the English are a just people and only require our case to be clearly stated in order to redress our grievances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It is more than time that some voice should be raised – even though it may be the voice of one crying in the wilderness – to tell the Press and the public that this is a grave and injurious delusion, which must be expunged from our minds if we would see things as they really are.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 24"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The English are not, as they are fond of representing themselves, a people panting to do justice to all whom they have to govern.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>They are not an incarnation of justice, neither are they an embodiment of morality; but of all nations they are the most sentimental: hence it is that they like to think themselves, and to be thought by others, a just people and a moral people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It is true that in the dull comedy which we call English politics, Truth and Justice – written in large letters – cover the whole of the poster, but in the actual enactment of the play these characters have very little indeed to do.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It was certainly not by appealing to the English sense of justice that the Irish people have come </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 9</p>
<p class="PE"> within reach of obtaining some measure of redress for their grievances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Mr. Parnell was enabled to force Mr. Gladstone’s hand solely because he had built up a strong party with a purely Irish policy: but we unfortunately have neither a Parnell nor a party with a purely Indian policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We have Mr. Naoroji and Sir W. Wedderburn, both staunch friends of India; we have Mr. Swift McNeill, true son of a high souled and chivalrous race; we have Mr. Mclaren, Mr. Paul and many others pledged to champion the Congress movement: but well nigh all these are Liberal members who must give their support to Mr. Gladstone, whether he is inclined to do justice to India or no.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It is evident that if we wish to obtain any real justice from the British Parliament we must secure the pledges not of individual Liberals but of the responsible heads of the party, and that is just what we are least likely to obtain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>For we must remember that within the last 20 years the immense personal influence of Mr. Gladstone has been leavening and indeed remoulding English political life; and the tendency of that influence has been to convert politics into a huge market where statesmen chaffer for votes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>In this political bazaar we have no current coin to buy justice from the great salesman, and if he is inclined to give the commodity gratis, he will jeopardise many of the voters he has already in his hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>What lever have we then by which we can alter the entire fuse of English opinion on Indian matters?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is clear that we have none.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 25"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Moreover the lessons of experience do not differ from the lessons of common sense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>After years of constant effort and agitation a bill was brought forward in Parliament professing to remodel the Legislative Councils.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>This bill was nothing short of an insult to the people of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We had asked for wheaten bread, and we got in its place a loaf made of plaster-of-Paris and when Mr. Schwann proposed that the genuine article should be supplied, Mr. Gladstone assured him on his honour as a politician that the Executive authority would do its best to make plaster-of-Paris taste exactly like wheat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>With this assurance Mr. Schwann and the Indian people were quite satisfied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Happy Indian people!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>And yet now that the loaf has actually reached their hands, they seem a little inclined to quarrel with the gift: they have even </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="PE"> complained that the proportion of plaster in its composition is extravagantly large.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless we still go on appealing to the English sense of justice.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 26"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The simple truth of the matter is that we shall not get from the British Parliament anything better than nominal redress, or at the most a petty and tinkering legislation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>This is no doubt a very disagreeable truth to the sanguine among us who believe that India can be renovated in a day, but we shall gain nothing by shutting our eyes to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Rather we shall lose: for the more we linger in the wrong path, the further we shall wander from our real and legitimate goal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>If we are indeed to renovate our country, we must no longer hold out supplicating hands to the English Parliament, like an infant crying to its nurse for a toy, but must recognise the hard truth that every nation must beat out its own path to salvation with pain and difficulty, and not rely on the tutelage of another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>It is not within the scope of the present article to point out how this may be done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But until we recognise these simple truths, half of our efforts will fail – as they are now failing – through misdirection and want of real insight.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>So or nearly so runs an apophthegm<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="5" href="#">1</a> of the Galilean prophet, whose name has run over the four quarters of the globe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Of all those pithy comments on human life, which more than anything else made his teaching effective, this is perhaps the one which goes home deepest and admits of the most frequent use.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But very few Indians will be found to admit – certainly I myself two years ago would not have admitted,– that it can truthfully be applied to the National Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Yet that it can be so applied,– nay, that no judicious mind can honestly pronounce any other verdict on its action,– is the first thing I must prove, if these articles are to have any <i>raison d’être</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>I am quite aware that in doing this my motive and my prudence may be called into question.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>I am not ignorant that I am about to censure a body which to many of my countrymen seems the mightiest outcome of our new national life; to some a precious urn in which are guarded our brightest and noblest hopes; to others a guiding star which shall lead us through the encircling gloom to a far distant paradise: and if I were not fully confident that this fixed idea of ours is a snare and a delusion, likely to have the most pernicious effects, I should simply have suppressed my own doubts and remained silent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>As it is, I am fully confident, and even hope to bring over one or two of my countrymen to my own way of thinking, or, if that be not possible, at any rate to induce them to think a little more deeply than they have done.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 32"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>I know also that I shall stir the bile of those good people who are so enamoured of the British Constitution that they cannot like anyone who is not a partisan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>“What!” they will say “you pretend to be a patriot yourself, and you set yourself with a light heart to attack a body of patriots, which has no reason at all for existing except patriotism,– nay, which is the efflorescence, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 12</p>
<p class="PE"> the crown, the summit and coping-stone of patriotism?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>How wickedly inconsistent all this is!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>If you are really a friend to New India, why do you go about to break up our splendid unanimity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The Congress has not yet existed for two lustres; and in that brief space of time has achieved miracles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>And even if it has faults, as every institution, however excellent it may be, must have its faults, have you any plausible reason for telling our weakness in the streets of Gath, and so taking our enemies into the secret?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Now, if I were a strong and self-reliant man, I should of course go in the way I had chosen without paying much attention to these murmurers, but being, as I am, exceedingly nervous and afraid of offending anyone, I wish to stand well, even with those who admire the British Constitution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>I shall therefore find it necessary to explain at some length the attitude which I should like all thinking men to adopt towards the Congress.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 33"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And first, let me say that I am not much moved by one argument which may possibly be urged against me.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The Congress, it will be said, has achieved miracles, and in common gratitude we ought not to expose it to any<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="6" href="#">2</a> sort of harsh or malevolent criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Let us grant for the moment that the Congress has achieved miracles for us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Certainly, if it has done that, we ought to hold it for ever in our grateful memory; but if our gratitude goes beyond this, it at once incurs the charge of fatuity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>This is the difference between a man and an institution; a great man who has done great things for his country, demands from us our reverence, and however he may fall short in his after-life, a great and high-hearted nation – and no nation was ever justly called great that was not high-hearted – will not lay rude hands on him to dethrone him from his place in their hearts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But an institution is a very different thing, it was made for the use and not at all for the worship of man, and it can only lay claim to respect so long as its beneficent action remains not a memory of the past, but a thing of the present.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>We cannot afford to raise any institution to the rank of a fetish.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>To do so would be simply to become the slaves of our own machinery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>However I will at once admit that if an institution has really done miracles for us,– and miracles which are not mere conjuring tricks, but of a </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 13</p>
<p class="PE"> deep and solemn import to the nation,– and if it is still doing and likely yet to do miracles for us, then without doubt it may lay claim to a certain immunity from criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But I am not disposed to admit that all this is true of the Congress.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 34"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It is within the recollection of most of us to how giddy an eminence this body was raised, on how prodigious a wave of enthusiasm, against how immense a weight of resisting winds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>So sudden was it all that it must have been difficult, I may almost say impossible, even for a strong man to keep his head and not follow with the shouting crowd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>How shall we find words vivid enough to describe the fervour of those morning hopes, the April splendour of that wonderful enthusiasm?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The Congress was to us all that is to man most dear, most high and most sacred; a well of living water in deserts more than Saharan, a proud banner in the battle of Liberty, and a holy temple of concord where the races met and mingled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It was certainly the nucleus or thrice-distilled essence of the novel modes of thought among us; and if we took it for more than it really was,– if we took it for our pillar of cloud by day and pillar of fire by night; if we worshipped it as the morning-star of our liberty; if we thought of old myths, of the trumpets that shook down Jericho or the brazen serpent that healed the plague, and nourished fond and secret hopes that the Congress would prove all this and more than this; – surely our infatuation is to be passed by gently as inevitable in that environment rather than censured as unnatural or presuming.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 35"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>If then anyone tells me that the Congress was itself a miracle, if in nothing else, at any rate in the enthusiasm of which it was the centre, I do not know that I shall take the trouble to disagree with him; but if he goes on and tells me that the Congress has achieved miracles, I shall certainly take leave to deny the truth of his statement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It appears to me that the most signal successes of this body were not miracles at all, but simply the natural outcome of its constitution and policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>I suppose that in the sphere of active politics its greatest success is to be found in the enlargement of the Legislative Councils.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Well, that was perhaps a miracle in its way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>In England a very common trick is to put one ring under a hat and produce in another part of the room </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 14</p>
<p class="PE"> what appears to be the same ring and is really one exactly like it – except perhaps for the superscription.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Just such a miracle is this which the Congress has so triumphantly achieved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Another conjuring trick, and perhaps a cleverer one, was the snatch vote about Simultaneous Examinations, which owed its success to the sentimentalism of a few members of Parliament, the self-seeking of others and the carelessness of the rest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But these, however much we may praise them for cleverness, are, as I hope to show later on, of no really deep and solemn import to the nation, but simply conjuring tricks and nothing more.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Over the rest of our political action the only epitaph we can write is “Failure.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Even in the first flush of enthusiasm the more deep-thinking among us were perhaps a little troubled by certain small things about the Congress, which did not seem altogether right.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The barefaced hypocrisy of our enthusiasm for the Queen-Empress,– an old lady so called by way of courtesy, but about whom few Indians can really know or care anything – could serve no purpose but to expose us to the derision of our ill-wishers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>There was too a little too much talk about the blessings of British rule, and the inscrutable Providence which has laid us in the maternal, or more properly the step-maternal bosom of just and benevolent England.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Yet more appalling was the general timidity of the Congress, its glossing over of hard names, its disinclination to tell the direct truth, its fear of too deeply displeasing our masters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>But in our then state of mind we were disposed to pass over all this as amiable weaknesses which would wear off with time.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>It was true that we went out of our way to flatter Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Gladstone, a statesman who is not only quite unprincipled and in no way to be relied upon, but whose intervention in an Indian debate has always been of the worst omen to our cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>But then, we argued, people who had not been to England, could not be expected to discern the character of this astute and plausible man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>We did more than flatter Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Gladstone; we actually condescended to flatter “General” Booth, a vulgar imposter, a convicted charlatan, who has enriched himself by trading on the sentimental emotions of the English middle-class.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>In the first flush of enthusiasm, I say, such excuses and such toleration were possible and even natural, but in the moment of disillusionment it will not do for us to flatter ourselves in this way any longer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Those amiable weaknesses we were then disposed to pass over very lightly have not at all worn off with time, but have rather grown into an ingrained habit; and the tendency to grosser errors has grown not only into a habit, but into a policy.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 40"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>But after all my present business is not with negative criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>I want rather to ascertain what the Congress has really done, and whether it is so much as to condemn all patriots to an Eleusinian silence about its faults.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>My own genuine opinion was expressed, perhaps with too much exuberance of diction,– but then the ghost of ancient enthusiasm was nudging my elbow – when I described the Congress as a well of living water, a standard in the battle, and a holy temple of concord.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is a well of living water in the sense that we drink from it assurance of a living political energy in the country, and without that assurance perhaps the most advanced among us might not have been so advanced: for it is only one or two strong and individual minds, who can flourish without a sympathetic environment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I am therefore justified in describing the Congress as a well of living water; but I have also described it as the standard under which we have fought; and by that I mean a living emblem of our cause the tired and warworn soldier in the mellay can look up to and draw from time<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7" href="#">1</a> to time fresh funds of hope and vigour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Such, and such only, is the purpose of a banner.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>One does not like to say that what must surely be apparent even to a rude intelligence, has been beyond the reach of intellects trained at our Universities and in the liberal professions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Yet it is a fact that we have entirely ignored what a casual inspection ought at once to have told us, that the Congress is altogether too unwieldy a body for any sort of executive work, and must solely be regarded as a convenient alembic, in which the formulae of our aspirations may be refined into clear and accurate expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Not content with using a banner as a banner, we have actually caught up the staff of it with a view to<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="8" href="#">2</a> breaking our enemy’s heads.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>So blind a misuse must take away at least a third part of its virtue from the Congress, and if we are at all to recover the loss, we must recognize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="9" href="#">3</a> the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 17</p>
<p class="PE"> limits of its utility as well as emend the device upon it.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 41"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The Congress has been, then, a well of living water and a standard in the battle of liberty; but besides these it has been something which is very much better than either of them, good as they too undoubtedly are; it has been to our divergent races and creeds a temple, or perhaps I should be more correct in saying a school of concord.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In other words the necessities of the political movement initiated by the Congress have brought into one place and for a common purpose all sorts and conditions of men, and so by smoothing away the harsher discrepancies between them has created a certain modicum of sympathy between classes that were more or less at variance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Here, and not in its political action, must we look for any direct and really important achievement; and even here the actual advance has as a rule been absurdly exaggerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Popular orators like Mr. Pherozshah Mehta, who carry the methods of the bar into politics, are very fond of telling people that the Congress has habituated us to act together.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Well, that is not quite correct: there is not the slightest evidence to show that we have at all learned to act together; the one lesson we have learned is to talk together, and that is a rather different thing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Here then we have in my opinion the sum of all these capacities, in which the Congress has to any appreciable extent promoted the really high and intimate interests of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Can it then be said that in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="10" href="#">4</a> these lines the Congress has had such entirely beneficial effects as to put the gag on all harsher criticism?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>I do not think that it can be properly so said.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>I admit that the Congress has promoted a certain modicum of concord among us; but I am not prepared to admit that on this line of action its outcome has been at all complete and satisfying.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Not only has the concord it tends to create been very partial, but the sort of people who have been included in its beneficent action, do not extend beyond certain fixed and narrow limits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The great mass of the people have not been appreciably touched by that healing principle, which to do the Congress justice has very widely permeated the middle class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>All this would still leave us without sufficient grounds to censure the Congress at all severely, if only it were clear that its present line of action was </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 18</p>
<p class="PE"> tending to increase the force and scope of its beneficence: but in fact the very contrary appears.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>We need no soothsayer to augur that, unless its entire policy be remodelled, its power for good, even in the narrow circle of its present influence, will prove to have been already exploited.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>One sphere still remains to it; it is still our only grand assurance of a living political energy in the country: but even this well of living water must in the end be poisoned or dried up, if the inner political energy of which it is the outward assurance remains as poor and bounded as we now find it to be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If then it is true that the action of the Congress has only been of really high import on one or two lines, that even on those lines the actual result has been petty and imperfect, and that in all its other aspects we can pronounce no verdict on it but failure, then it is quite clear that we shall get no good by big talk about the splendid unanimity at the back of the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>A splendid unanimity in failure may be a very magnificent thing in its way, but in our present exigencies it is an unanimity really not worth having.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But perhaps the Congress enthusiast will take refuge in stinging reproaches about my readiness to publish our weakness to the enemy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Well, even if he does I can assure him that however stinging his reproaches may be, I shall not feel at all stung by them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>I leave that for those honest people who imagine that, when they have got the Civil Service and other lucrative posts for themselves, the Indian question will be satisfactorily settled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Our actual enemy is not any force exterior to ourselves, but our own crying weaknesses, our cowardice, our selfishness, our hypocrisy, our purblind sentimentalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>I really cannot see why we should rage so furiously against the Anglo-Indians and call them by all manner of opprobrious epithets.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>I grant that they are rude and arrogant, that they govern badly, that they are devoid of any great or generous emotion, that their conduct is that of a small coterie of masters surrounded by a nation of Helots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But to say all this is simply to say that they are very commonplace men put into a quite unique position.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Certainly it would be very grand and noble, if they were to smother all thought of their own peculiar interests, and aim henceforth, not at their own promotion, not at their own enrichment, but at the <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> sole good of the Indian people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But such conduct is what we have no right to expect save from men of the most exalted and chivalrous character; and the sort of people England sends out to us are not as a rule exalted and chivalrous, but are usually the very reverse of that.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>They are really very ordinary men,– and not only ordinary men, but ordinary Englishmen – types of the middle class or Philistines, in the graphic English phrase, with the narrow hearts and commercial habit of mind peculiar to that sort of people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is something very like folly to quarrel with them for not transgressing the law of their own nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>If we were not so dazzled by the artificial glare of English prestige, we should at once acknowledge that these men are really not worth being angry with: and if it is idle to be angry with them, it is still more unprofitable to rate their opinion of us at more than a straw’s value.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Our appeal, the appeal of every high-souled and self-respecting nation, ought not to be to the opinion of the Anglo-Indians, no, nor yet to the British sense of justice, but to our own reviving sense of manhood, to our own sincere fellow-feeling – so far as it can be called sincere – with the silent and suffering people of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>I am sure that eventually the nobler part of us will prevail,– that when we no longer obey the dictates of a veiled self-interest, but return to the profession of a large and genuine patriotism, when we cease to hanker after the soiled crumbs which England may cast to us from her table, then it will be to that sense of manhood, to that sincere fellow-feeling that we shall finally and forcibly appeal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>All this, it will be said, may be very true or very plausible, but it is after all made up of unsupported assertions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>I quite admit that it is more or less so, nor did I at all intend that it should be otherwise; the proof and support of those assertions is a matter for patient development and wholly beside my present purpose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>I have been thus elaborate with one sole end in view.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>I wish even the blindest enthusiast to recognise that I have not ventured to speak without carefully weighing those important considerations that might have induced me to remain silent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>I trust that after this laboured preface even those most hostile to my views will not accuse me of having undertaken anything lightly or rashly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>In my own opinion <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> I should not have been to blame even if I had spoken without this painful hesitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>If the Congress cannot really face the light of a free and serious criticism, then the sooner it hides its face the better.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>For nine years it has been exempt from the ordeal; we have been content to worship it with that implicit trust which all religions demand, but which sooner or later leads them to disaster and defeat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Certainly we had this excuse that the stress of battle is not the time when a soldier can stop to criticize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11" href="#">5</a> his weapon: he has simply to turn it to the best use of which it is capable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>So long as India rang with turbulent voices of complaint and agitation, so long as the air was filled with the turmoil of an angry controversy between governors and governed, so long we could have little leisure or quiet thought and reflection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>But now all is different; the necessity for conflict is no longer so urgent and has even given place to a noticeable languor and passivity, varied only by perfunctory public meetings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Now therefore, while the great agitation that once filled this vast peninsula with rumours of change, is content to occupy an obscure corner of English politics it will be well for all of us who are capable of reflection, to sit down for a moment and think.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The hour seems to have come when the Congress must encounter that searching criticism which sooner or later arrives to all mortal things; and if it is so, to keep our eyes shut will be worse than idle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>The only good we shall get by it is to point with a fresh example the aphorism with which I set out.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 48"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Thus far I have been making a circuit, in my disinclination to collide too abruptly with the prepossessions of my countrymen and now that I am compelled to handle my subject more intimately and with a firmer grasp, nothing but my deliberate conviction that it is quite imperative for someone to speak out, has at all persuaded me to continue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>I have at the very outset to make distinct the grounds on which I charge the Congress with inadequacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In the process I find myself bound to say many things that cannot fail to draw obloquy upon me: I shall be compelled to outrage many susceptibilities; compelled to advance many unacceptable ideas; compelled,– worst of all,– to stroke the wrong way many powerful persons, who are wont to be pampered with unstinted flattery and worship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But at all risks the thing must be done, and since it is on me that the choice has fallen, I can only proceed in the best fashion at my command and with what boldness I may.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>I say, of the Congress, then, this,– that its aims are mistaken, that the spirit in which it proceeds towards their accomplishment is not a spirit of sincerity and whole-heartedness, and that the methods it has chosen are not the right methods, and the leaders in whom it trusts, not the right sort of men to be leaders; – in brief, that we are at present the blind led, if not by the blind, at any rate by the one-eyed.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 49"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>To begin with, I should a little while ago have had no hesitation in saying that the National Congress was not really national and had not in any way attempted to become <i>national</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But that was before I became a student of Mr. Pherozshah Mehta’s </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 22</p>
<p class="PE"> speeches.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Now to deal with this vexed subject, one must tread on very burning ground, and I shall make no apology for treading with great care and circumspection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The subject is wrapped in so thick a dust of controversy, and legal wits have been so busy drawing subtle distinctions about it, that a word which was once perfectly straightforward and simple, has become almost as difficult as the Law itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is therefore incumbent on me to explain what I wish to imply, when I say that the Congress is not really national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Now I do not at all mean to re-echo the Anglo-Indian catchword about the Hindus and Mahomedans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Like most catchwords it is without much force, and has been still farther<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="12" href="#">1</a> stripped of meaning by the policy of the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Mahomedans have been as largely represented on that body as any reasonable community could desire, and their susceptibilities, far from being denied respect, have always been most assiduously soothed and flattered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is entirely futile then to take up the Anglo-Indian refrain; but this at least I should have imagined, that in an era when democracy and similar big words slide so glibly from our tongues, a body like the Congress, which represents not the mass of the population, but a single and very limited class, could not honestly be called national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is perfectly true that the House of Commons represents not the English nation, but simply the English aristocracy and middle class and yet is none the less national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But the House of Commons is a body legally constituted and empowered to speak and act for the nation, while the Congress is self-created: and it is not justifiable for a self-created body representing only a single and limited class to call itself national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It would be just as absurd if the Liberal party, because it allows within its limits all sorts and conditions of men, were to hold annual meetings and call itself the English National Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>When therefore I said that the Congress was not really national, I simply meant that it did not represent the mass of the population.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 50"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Pherozshah Mehta will have nothing to do with this sense of the word.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>In his very remarkable and instructive Presidential address at Calcutta, he argued that the Congress could justly arrogate this epithet without having any direct support </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 23</p>
<p class="PE"> from the proletariate; and he went on to explain his argument with the profound subtlety expected from an experienced advocate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>“It is because the masses are still unable to articulate definite political demands that the functions and duty devolve upon their educated and enlightened compatriots to feel, to understand and to interpret their grievances and requirements, and to suggest and indicate how these can best be redressed and met.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This formidable sentence is, by the way, typical of Mr. Mehta’s style, and reveals the secret of his oratory, which like all great inventions is exceedingly simple: it is merely to say the same thing twice over in different words.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But its more noteworthy feature is the idea implied that because the Congress professes to discharge this duty, it may justly call itself national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Nor is this all; Calcutta comes to the help of Bombay in the person of Mr. Manmohan Ghose, who repeats and elucidates Mr. Mehta’s idea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Congress, he says, asserting the rights of that body to speak for the masses, represents the thinking portion of the Indian people, whose duty it is to guide the ignorant, and this in his opinion sufficiently justifies the Congress in calling itself national.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>To differ from a successful barrister and citizen, a man held in high honour by every graduate in India, and above all a future member of the Viceroy’s Council, would never have been a very easy task for a timid man like myself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But when he is reinforced by so respectable and weighty a citizen as Mr. Manmohan Ghose, I really cannot find the courage to persevere.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>I shall therefore amend the obnoxious phrase and declare that the National Congress may be as national as you please, but it is not a popular body and has not in any way attempted to become a popular body.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 51"><!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>But at this point someone a little less learned than Mr. Pherozshah Mehta may interfere and ask how it can be true that the Congress is not a popular body.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>I can only point his attention to a previous statement of mine that the Congress represents not the mass of the population, but a single and limited class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>No doubt the Congress tried very hard in the beginning to believe that it really represented the mass of the population, but if it has not already abandoned, it ought now at least to abandon the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 24</p>
<p class="PE"> pretension as quite untenable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>And indeed when Mr. Pherozshah Mehta and Mr. Manmohan Ghose have admitted this patent fact – not as delegates only, but as officials of the Congress – and have even gone so far as to explain the fact away, it is hardly requisite for me to combat the fallacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But perhaps the enquirer not yet satisfied, may go on to ask what is that single and limited class which I imagine the Congress to represent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Here it may be of help to us to refer again to the speeches of the Congress leaders and more especially to the talented men from whom I have already quoted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>In his able official address Mr. Manmohan Ghose asks himself this very question and answers that the Congress represents the thinking portion of the Indian people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>“The delegates present here today” he goes on “are the chosen representatives of that section of the Indian people who have learnt to think, and whose number is daily increasing with marvellous rapidity.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Perhaps Mr. Ghose is a little too facile in his use of the word “thinking”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>So much at the mercy of their instincts and prejudices are the generality of mankind, that we hazard a very high estimate when we call even one man out of ten thousand a thinking man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>But evidently by the thinking portion Mr. Ghose would like to indicate the class to which he himself belongs; I mean those of us who have got some little idea of the machinery of English politics and are eager to import it into India along with cheap Liverpool cloths, shoddy Brummagem wares, and other useful and necessary things which have killed the fine and genuine textures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>If this is a true interpretation he is perfectly correct in what he says.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>For it is really from this class that the Congress movement draws its origin, its support and its most enthusiastic votaries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>And if I were asked to describe their class by a single name, I should not hesitate to call it our new middle class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>For here too English goods have driven out native goods: our society has lost its old landmarks and is being demarcated on the English model.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>But of all the brand new articles we have imported, inconceivably the most important is that large class of people – journalists, barristers, doctors, officials, graduates and traders – who have grown up and are increasing with prurient rapidity under the aegis of the British rule: and <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> this class I call the middle class: for, when we are so proud of our imported English goods, it would be absurd, when we want labels for them, not to import their English names as well.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Besides this name which I have chosen is really a more accurate description than phrases like “thinking men” or “the educated class” which are merely expressions of our own boundless vanity and self-conceit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>However largely we may choose to indulge in vague rhetoric about the all-pervading influence of the Congress, no one can honestly doubt that here is the constituency from which it is really empowered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>There is indeed a small contingent of aristocrats and a smaller contingent of the more well-to-do ryots: but these are only two flying-wheels in the great middle-class machine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The fetish-worshipper may declare as loudly as he pleases, that it represents all sorts and conditions of people, just as the Anglo-Indians used to insist that it represented no one but the Bengali Babu.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Facts have been too strong for the Anglo-Indian and they will be too strong in the end for the fetish-worshipper.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Partisans on either side can in no way alter the clear and immutable truth – these words were put on paper long before the recent disturbances in Bombay and certainly without any suspicion that the prophecy I then hazarded would be fortified by so apt and striking a comment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Facts are already beginning to speak in a very clear and unambiguous voice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>How long will the Congress sit like careless Belshazzar, at the feast of mutual admiration?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Already the decree has gone out against it; already even the eyes that are dim can discern,– for has it not been written in blood? – the first pregnant phrase of the handwriting upon the wall.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 56"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>I repeat then with renewed confidence, but still with a strong desire to conciliate Mr. Pherozshah Mehta, that the Congress fails, because it has never been, and has made no honest endeavour to be, a popular body empowered by the fiat of the Indian people in its entirety.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>But for all that I have not managed to bring my view into coincidence with Mr. Mehta’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is true he is not invincibly reluctant to concede the limits, which hedge in the Congress action and restrict its output of energy; but he is quite averse to the dictum that by not transgressing the middle-class pale the Congress has condemned itself, as a saving power, to insignificance and ultimate sterility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The bounded scope of its potency and the subdued tone which it affects, are, he opines, precisely what our actual emergencies of the moment imperatively demand; wider activity and a more intense emphasis would be in his view highly unadvisable and even injurious and besides it does not at all signify whether we are fortified by popular sympathy or are not; for is not Mr. Pherozshah Mehta there with all the enlightenment of India at his back to plead temperately – temperately, mind you; we are nothing if not temperate – for just and remedial legislation on behalf of a patient and suffering people?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In plain words a line of argument is adopted amounting to this: – “The Congress movement is nothing if not a grand suit-at-law, best described as the case of India <i>vs</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Anglo-India, in which the ultimate tribunal is the British sense of justice, and Pherozshah Mehta, Mr. Umesh Chandra Bonnerji<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="13" href="#">1</a> and the other eminent leaders of the bar are counsel for the complainant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Well then when so many experienced advocates have bound themselves to find pleas for him, would it not be highly rash and inopportune for the client to insist on conducting his own complaint?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Now it is abundantly clear that, judged as it stands, this line of argument, though adroit beyond cavil and instinct </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 27</p>
<p class="PE"> with legal ingenuity, will nevertheless not answer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>I am not going to deny that Mr. Pherozshah Mehta and the enlightenment of India, such as it is, are pleading, undoubtedly with temperance and perhaps with sincerity, for something or other, which for want of a more exact description, we may call remedial legislation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But so far there has been nothing at all to prevent me from denying that the analogy of the law-court holds; this sort of vicarious effort may be highly advantageous in judicial matters, but it is not, I would submit, at all adequate to express the reviving energies of a great people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The argument, I say, is not complete in itself, or to use a vernacular phrase, it will not walk; it badly wants a crutch to lean upon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Mr. Mehta is clever enough to see that and his legal acumen has taken him exactly to the very store where or not at all he must discover an efficient crutch.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>So he goes straight to history, correctly surmising that the experience of European races is all that we, a people new to modern problems, can find to warn or counsel us, and he tells us that this sort of vicarious effort has invariably been the original step towards progress: or, to put it in his own rhetorical way, “History teaches us that such has been the law of widening progress in all ages and all countries, notably in England itself.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Here then is the argument complete, crutch and all; and so adroit is it that in Congress propaganda it has become a phrase of common parlance, and is now in fact the stereotyped line of defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Certainly, if he is accurate in his historical data, Mr. Mehta has amply proved his case; but in spite of all his adroitness, I suspect that his trend towards double-shotted phrases has led him into a serious difficulty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>“In all ages and all countries” is a very big expression, and Mr. Mehta will be exceedingly lucky if it will stand a close scrutiny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Manmohan Ghose at least is a sober speaker; and if we have deserted his smooth but perhaps rather tedious manner for a more brilliant style of oratory, now at any rate, when the specious orator fails us, we may well return to the rational disputant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But we shall be agreeably disappointed to find that this vivid statement about the teaching of History is Mr. Ghose’s own legitimate offspring and not the coinage of Mr. Mehta’s heated fancy: indeed, the latter has done nothing but <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> convey it bodily into his own address.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>“History teaches us” says Mr. Ghose “that in all ages and all countries it is the thinking classes who have led the unthinking, and in the present state of our society we are bound not only to think for ourselves, but also to think for those who are still too ignorant to exercise that important function.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>When we find the intellectual princes of the nation light-heartedly propagating such gross inaccuracies, we are really tempted to inquire if high education is after all of any use.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>History teaches us!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Why, these gentlemen can never have studied any history at all except that of England.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Would they be ignorant otherwise that mainly to that country, if not to that country alone, their statement applies, but that about most ages and most countries it is hopelessly inaccurate?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Absurd as the statement is, its career has been neither limited nor obscure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Shot in the first instance from Mr. Ghose’s regulation smoothbore, it then served as a bullet in Mr. Pherozshah’s patent<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="14" href="#">2</a> new double-barrelled rifle, and has ultimately turned out the stock ammunition of the Congress against that particular line upon which I have initially ventured.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Here then the argument has culminated in a most important issue; for supposing this line of defence to be adequate, the gravest indictment I have to urge against the Congress goes at once to the ground.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It will therefore be advisable to scrutinize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="15" href="#">3</a> Mr. Ghose’s light-hearted statement; and if the policy he advocates is actually stamped with the genuine consensus of all peoples in all ages, then we shall very readily admit that there is no reason why the masses should not be left in their political apathy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But if it is quite otherwise and we cannot discover more than one precedent of importance, then Mr. Ghose and the Congress chairmen<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="16" href="#">4</a> will not make us dance to their music, charm they never so wisely, and we shall be slow to admit even the one precedent we have got without a very narrow scrutiny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>If then we are bent upon adopting England as our exemplar, we shall certainly imitate the progress of the glacier rather than the progress of the torrent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>From Runnymede to the Hull riots is a far cry; yet these seven centuries have done less to change partially the political and social exterior of England, than five short years to change entirely the political and <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> social exterior of her immediate neighbour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>But if Mr. Ghose’s dogmatic utterance is true of England, I imagine it does not apply with equal force to other climes and other eras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>For example, is it at all true of France?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Rather we know that the first step of that fortunate country towards progress was not through any decent and orderly expansion, but through a purification by blood and fire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It was not a convocation of respectable citizens, but the vast and ignorant proletariate, that emerged from a prolonged and almost coeval apathy and blotted out in five terrible years the accumulated oppression of thirteen centuries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>And if the example of France is not sufficient to deprive Mr. Ghose’s statement of force, let us divert our eyes to Ireland, where the ancient and world-wide quarrel between Celt and Teuton is still pending.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Is it at all true that the initiators of Irish resistance to England were a body of successful lawyers, remarkable only for a power of shallow rhetoric, and deputed by the sort of men that are turned out at Trinity College, Dublin?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>At any rate that is not what History tells us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We do not read that the Irish leaders annually assembled to declaim glib orations, eulogistic of British rule and timidly suggestive of certain flaws in its unparalleled excellence, nor did they suggest as a panacea for Irish miseries, that they should be given more posts and an ampler career in the British service.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>I rather fancy Turlough O’Neill and his compeers were a different sort of men from that.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>But then it is hardly fair perhaps to cite as an example a disreputable people never prolific of graduates and hence incapable of properly appreciating the extraordinary blessings which British rule gives out so liberally wherever it goes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Certainly men who preferred action to long speeches and appealed, by the only method available in that strenuous epoch, not to the British sense of justice but to their own sense of manhood, are not at all the sort of people we have either the will or the power to imitate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Well then let us return to our own orderly and eloquent era.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>But here too, just as the main strength of that ancient strenuous protest resided in the Irish populace led by the princes of their class, so the principal force of the modern subtler protest resides in the Irish peasantry led by the recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="17" href="#">5</a> chiefs of an united people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>I might go on and <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> cull instances from Italy and America but to elaborate the matter further would be to insult the understanding of my readers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It will be sufficient to remind them that the two grand instances of ancient history point to an exactly similar conclusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>In Athens and in Rome the first political quarrel is a distinct issue between the man of the people and a limited, perhaps an alien, aristocracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The force behind Cleisthenes and the constituency that empowered Tiberius Gracchus were not a narrow middle class, but the people with its ancient wrongs and centuries of patient endurance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 57"><!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>If then, as we are compelled to infer, Mr. Mehta’s statement is entirely inaccurate of remoter ages and in modern times accurate of one country alone, we shall conclude that whatever other proof he may find for his lame argument, that crutch at least is too large and must go to the ground.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Mehta, too acute and experienced a pleader to be disheartened by any initial failure, will no doubt pick up his crutch again and whittle it down to the appropriate size.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>It may be quite correct, he will perhaps tell me, that his statement applies with appreciable force to England and to England alone but when all is said, it does not eventually matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>In allowing that his statement does generally apply to England, I have admitted everything he seriously wants me to admit, for England is after all that country which has best prospered in its aspirations after progress, and must therefore be the grand political exemplar of every nation animated by a like spirit, and it must be peculiarly and beyond dispute such for India in her present critical stage of renascence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>I am quite aware that in the eyes of that growing community which Mr. Ghose is pleased to call the thinking class, these plausible assertions are only the elementary axioms of political science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>But however confidently such statements are put before me, I am not at all sure that they are entirely correct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>I have not quite made up my mind that England is indeed that country which has best prospered in its aspirations after progress and I am as yet unconvinced that it will eventually turn out at all a desirable exemplar for every nation aspiring to progress, or even for its peculiar pupil, renascent India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>I shall therefore feel more disposed to probe </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 31</p>
<p class="PE"> the matter to the bottom than to acknowledge a very disputable thesis as in any way self-evident.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>To this end it is requisite closely to inquire what has actually been the main outcome of English political effort, and whether it is of a nature to justify any implicit reliance on English methods or exact imitation of English models.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 62"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We have then to appreciate the actual conditions of English progress, in their sound no less than their unsound aspects: and it will be to our convenience to have ready some rough formulae by which we may handle the subject in an intelligible way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>To this problem Mr. Surendranath Banerji, a man who with all his striking merits, has never evinced any power of calm and serious thought, proffers a very grandiloquent and heart-stirring solution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>“We rely” he has said “on the liberty-loving instincts of the greatest representative assembly in the world, the palladium of English Liberty, the sanctuary of the free and brave, the British House of Commons” and at this inspiriting discharge of oratory there was, we are told, nor do we wonder at it – a responding volley of loud and protracted applause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Now when Mr. Banerji chooses to lash himself into an oratorical frenzy and stir us with his sounding rhetoric, it is really impracticable for anything human to stand up and oppose him: and though I may hereafter tone down his oriental colouring to something nearer the hue of truth, yet it does not at present serve my purpose to take up arms against a sea of eloquence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>I would rather admit at once the grain of sound fact at the core of all this than strip off the costly integuments with which Mr. Banerji’s elaborate Fancy chooses to invest it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But when Mr. Banerji’s words no longer reverberate in your ears, you may have leisure to listen to a quieter, more serious voice, now unhappily hushed in the grave,– the voice of Matthew Arnold, himself an Englishman and genuine lover of his country, but for all that a man who thought deeply and spoke sanely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>And where according to this sane and powerful intellect shall we come across the really noteworthy outcome of English effort?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We shall best see it, he tells us, not in any palladium or sanctuary, not in the greatest representative assembly in the world, but in an aristocracy materialized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="18" href="#">1</a>, a </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 33</p>
<p class="PE"> middle class vulgarised and a lower class brutalized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="19" href="#">2</a>: and no clear-sighted student of England will be insensible to the just felicity with which he has hit off the social tendencies prevailing in that country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Here then we have ready rough formulae by which we may, at the lowest, baldly outline the duplicate aspect of modern England: for now that we have admitted Mr. Banerji’s phrase as symbolic of the healthy outcome creditable to English effort, we can hardly be shy of admitting Matthew Arnold’s phrase as symbolic of the morbid outcome discreditable to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But it is still open to us to evince a reasonable doubt whether there is any way of reconciling two items so mutually destructive: for it does seem paradoxical to rate the produces of institutions so highly lauded and so universally copied at a low grade in the social ladder.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But this apparent paradox may easily be a vital truth; and in establishing that, as I hope to establish it, I shall have incidentally to moot another and wider theorem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>I would urge that our entire political philosophy is rooted in shallow earth, so much so indeed that without repudiation or radical change we cannot arrive at an attitude of mind healthily conducive to just and clear thinking.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>I am conscious that the argument has hitherto been rather intangible and moved too largely among wide abstract principles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Such a method is by its nature less keenly attractive to the general readers than a close and lively handling of current politics, but it is required for an adequate development of my case, and I must entreat indulgence a step or two further, before I lay any grasp on the hard concrete details of our actual political effort.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 63"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Now the high value at which Mr. Mehta appraises history as our sole available record of human experience in the mass will clearly be endorsed by every thoughtful and judicious mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But to sustain it at that high level of utility, we must not indulge in hasty deductions based on a very partial scrutiny, but must group correctly and digest in a candid spirit such data as we can bring within our compass.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>If we observe this precept, we shall not easily coincide with his opinion that European progress has been of a single texture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We shall rather be convinced that there run through it two principles of motion distinct in nature and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 34</p>
<p class="PE"> adverse in event, the trend of whose divergence may be roundly expressed as advance in one direction through political methods and in another direction through social methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But as the use of these time-worn epithets might well promote misconception and drag us into side-issues, I will attempt a more delicate handling and solicit that close attention without which so remote and elusive a subject cannot come home to the mind with proper force and clearness.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 64"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In bringing abstractions home to the human intelligence, it is perhaps best to dispel by means of near and concrete specimens that sense of remoteness which we shrink from in what is at all intangible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Hence I shall attempt to differentiate by living instances the two principles which I suggest as the main motors of progress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The broad cast of national thought in England prevalent from very early times, may not inappropriately stand for the sort of progress that runs after a political prize.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The striking fact of English history – the fact that dwarfs all others – is, without doubt, the regular development from certain primordial seeds and the continuous branching out, foliation and efflorescence of the institution which Mr. Banerji has justly termed the greatest representative assembly in the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This is highly typical of the English school of thought and the exaggerated emphasis it lays on the mould and working of institutions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>However supreme in the domain of practical life, however gifted with commercial vigour and expansive energy, the English mind with its short range of vision, its too little of delicacy and exactness, its inability to go beyond what it actually sees, is wholly unfit for any nice appraisal of cause and effect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It is without vision, logic, the spirit of curiosity, and hence it has not any habit of entertaining clear and high ideals, any audacity of experiment, any power of finding just methods nicely adopted to produce the exact effect intended: – it is without speculative temerity and the scientific spirit, and hence it cannot project great political theories nor argue justly from effect to cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>All these incapacities have forced the English mind into a certain mould of thought and expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Limited to the visible and material, they have put their whole force into mechanical invention; void of curiosity, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="PE"> they have hazarded just so much experiment and no more, as was necessary to suit existing institutions to their immediate wants; inexact, they have never cared in these alterations to get at more than an approximation to the exact effect intended; illogical and without subtlety, they have trusted implicitly to the political machines, for whose invention they have a peculiar genius, and never cared to utilize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="20" href="#">3</a> mightier forces and a subtler method.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In fact it reduces itself to the statement, that, given good machinery, then no matter what quality of material<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="22" href="#">5</a> is passed through it, the eventual fabric will be infallibly of the most superior sort.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 65"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>But if we carry our glance across the English Channel, we shall witness a very different and more animating spectacle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Gifted with a lighter, subtler and clearer mind than their insular neighbours, the French people have moved irresistibly towards a social and not a political development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It is true that French orators and statesmen, incapacitated by their national character from originating fit political ideals, have adopted a set of institutions curiously blended from English and American manufactures; but the best blood, the highest thought, the real grandeur of the nation does not reside in the Senate or in the Chamber of Deputies; it resides in the artistic and municipal forces of Parisian life, in the firm settled executive, in the great vehement heart of the French populace – and that has ever beaten most highly in unison with the grand ideas of Equality and Fraternity, since they were first enounced on the banner of the great and terrible Republic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Hence though by the indiscreet choice of a machine, they have been compelled to copy the working of English machinery and concede an undue importance to politics, yet the ideals which have genuinely influenced the spirit which has most deeply permeated their national life are widely different from that alien spirit, from those borrowed ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>I have said that the French mind is clearer, subtler, lighter than the English.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>In that clarity they have discerned that without high qualities in the raw material excellence of machinery will not suffice to create a sound and durable national character,– that it may indeed develop a strong, energetic and capable temper, but that the fabric will not combine fineness with strength, will not resist permanently the wear and tear of time and the rending force of social problems: – through that subtlety they divined that not by the mechanic working of institutions, but by the delicate and almost unseen moulding of a fine, lucid and invigorating atmosphere, could a robust and highly-wrought social temper be developed: – and through that lightness they chose not the fierce, sharp air of English individualism, but the bright influence of art and letters, of happiness, a wide and liberal culture, and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 37</p>
<p class="PE"> the firm consequent cohesion of their racial and social elements.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>To put all this briefly, the second school of thought I would indicate to my readers, is the preference of a fine development of social character and a wide diffusion of happiness to the mechanic development of a sound political machinery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Here then as indicated by these grand examples we have our two principal motors of progress; a careful requisition, for the sake of evolving an energetic national character and high level of capacity, of a sound political machinery; and the ardent, yet rational pursuit, for its own sake, of a sound and highly-wrought social temper.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 66"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It may be worth while here to develop a point I have broadly suggested, that with these distinct lines of feeling accord distinct types of racial character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The social ideal is naturally limited to peoples distinguished by a rare social gift and an unbounded receptivity for novel ideas along with a large amount of practical capacity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The ancient Athenian, preeminent for lightness of temper and lucidity of thought, was content with the simplest and most nakedly logical machinery, and principally sought to base political life on equality, a wide diffusion of culture, and a large and just social principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Moreover, as the subtlest and hence the most efficient way of conserving the high calibre of his national character, he chose the infusion of light, gaiety and happiness into the common life of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Clear in thought and felicitous in action, he pursued an ideal strictly consonant with his natural temper and rigidly exclusive of the anomalous: and so highly did he attain, that the quick, shifting, eager Athenian life, with its movement and colour, its happy buoyancy, its rapid genius, or, as the Attic poet beautifully phrases it, walking delicately through a fine and lucid air, has become the admiration and envy of posterior ages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The modern Frenchman closely allied by his clear habit of mind to the old Athenian, himself lucid in thought, light in temper and not without a supreme felicity of method in practical things, evinces much the same sentiments, pursues much the same ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>He too has a happily-adjusted executive machinery, elaborated indeed to fit the needs of a modern community, but pervaded by a thoroughly clear and logical spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>He also has a passionate craving for equality </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 38</p>
<p class="PE"> and a large and just social principle, and prefers to conserve the high calibre of his national character by the infusion of light, gaiety and happiness into the common life of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>And he too has so far compassed his ideal that a consensus of competent observers have pronounced France certainly the happiest, and, taken in the mass, the most civilized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="23" href="#">6</a> of modern countries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>But to the Englishman or American, intellect, lucidity, happiness are not of primary importance: they strike him in the light of luxuries rather than necessities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>It is the useful citizen, the adroit man of business, the laborious worker, whom he commends with the warmest emphasis and copies with the most respectful emulation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>Such a cast of mind being entirely incompatible with social success, he directs his whole active powers into the grosser sphere of commerce and politics, where practical energy, unpurified by thought, may struggle forward to some vulgar and limited goal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>To put it in a concrete form Paris may be said to revolve around the Theatre, the Municipal Council and the French Academy, London looks rather to the House of Commons and New York to the Stock Exchange.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>I trust that I have now clearly elucidated the exact and intimate nature of those two distinct principles on which progress may be said to move.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>It now remains to gauge the practical effect of either policy as history indicates them to us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>We in India, or at any rate those races among us which are in the van of every forward movement, are far more nearly allied to the French and Athenian than to the Anglo-Saxon, but owing to the accident of British domination, our intellects have been carefully nurtured on a purely English diet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Hence we do not care to purchase an outfit of political ideas properly adjusted to our natural temper and urgent requirements, but must eke out our scanty wardrobe with the cast-off rags and threadbare leavings of our English Masters and this incongruous apparel we display with a pompous self-approval which no unfriendly murmurs, no unkind allusions are allowed to trouble.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Absurd as all this is, its visible outcome is clearly a grave misfortune.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Prompted by our English instruction we have deputed to a mere machine so arduous a business as the remoulding of our entire destinies, <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> needing as it does patient and delicate manual adjustment and a constant supervising vigilance – and this to a machine not efficient and carefully pieced together but clumsy and made on a rude and cheap model.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>So long as this temper prevails, we shall never realise how utterly it is beyond the power of even an excellent machine to renovate an effete and impoverished national character and how palpably requisite to commence from within and not depend on any exterior agency.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 71"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>That this intimate organic treatment of which I speak is really indispensable, will be clearly established by the annals of ancient Rome.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Romans were a nation quite unique in the composition and general style of their character; along with a predilection for practical energy, a purely material habit of mind, and an indifference to orderly and logical methods which suggest a strong affinity to the Anglo-Saxon temperament, they possessed a robust and clear perception, and a strong practical contempt for methods pronounced by hard experience to be ineffectual, which are entirely un-English and allied rather to the clarity and impatience of the Gaul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Moreover their whole character was moulded in a grand style, such as has not been witnessed by any prior or succeeding age – so much so that the striking description by which the Greek ambassador expressed the temper of the Roman Senate, might with equal justice be transferred to the entire people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>They were a nation of Kings: that is to say, they possessed the gift of handling the high things of life in a grand and imposing style, and with a success, an astonishing sureness of touch, only possible to a natural tact in government and a just, I may say a royal instinct for affairs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Yet this grand, imperial nation, even while it was most felicitous abroad in the manner and spirit in which it dealt with foreign peoples, was at home convulsed to a surprising extent by the worst forms of internal disorder: – and all for the want of that clear, sane ideal which has so highly promoted the domestic happiness of France and Athens.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>At first, indeed, the Romans inexpert in political methods, were inclined to repose an implicit trust in machinery, just as the English have been inclined from the primary stages of their development, and just as we are led to do by the contagious influence of the Anglomaniac disease.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>They hoped by the sole and mechanic action of certain highly lauded </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 41</p>
<p class="PE"> institutions to remove the disorders with which the Roman body politic was ailing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>And though at Rome no less than among ourselves, the social condition of the poor filled up the reform posters and a consequent amelioration was loudly trumpeted by the popular leaders, yet the genuine force of the movement was disposed, as is the genuine force of the present Congress movement, to the minimising of purely political inequality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But when the coveted institutions were in full swing, a sense gradually dawned on the people that the middle class had the sole enjoyment of any profit accruing from the change, as indeed it is always to the middle class alone that any profit accrues from the elimination of merely political inequality; but the great Roman populace untouched by the change for which they had sacrificed their ease and expended their best and highest energies, felt themselves pushed from misery to misery and broke out again in a wild storm of rebellion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But to maintain a stark persistence in unreason, to repose an unmoved confidence in the bounded potency of a mechanic formula, proved ineffectual by the cogent logic of hard experience, they had no thought, or if they had the thought, they being a genuinely practical race, and not like the English, straining after practicality, had not the disposition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Hence that mighty struggle was fought out with perplexed watchwords, amid wild alarms and rumours of battle and in a confused medley of blood, terror and unspeakable desolation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In that horror of great darkness, the Roman world crashed on from ruin to ruin, until the strong hand of Caesar stayed its descent to poise it on the stable foundation of a sane and vigilant policy rigorously enforced by the fixed will of a single despotic ruler.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But the grand secret of his success and the success of those puissant autocrats who inherited his genius and his ideals, was the clear perception attained to by them that only by social equality and the healing action of a firm despotism, could the disorders of Rome be permanently eradicated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Maligned as they have been by those who suffered from their astuteness and calm strength of will, the final verdict of posterity will laud in them that terrible intensity of purpose and even that iron indifference to personal suffering, which they evinced in forcing the Caesarian policy to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> its bitter but salutary end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The main lesson for us however is the pregnant conclusion that the Romans, to whom we cannot deny the supreme rank in the sphere of practical success, by attempting a cure through external and mechanic appliances entailed on themselves untold misery, untold disorder, and only by a thorough organic treatment restored the sanity, peace, settled government and calm felicity of an entire world.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 72"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But perhaps Mr. Mehta will tell me “What have we to do with the ancient Romans, we who have an entirely modern environment and suffer from disorders peculiar to ourselves?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Well, the connection is not perhaps so remote as Mr. Mehta imagines: I will not however press that point, but rather appeal to the instance of two great European nations, who also have an entirely modern environment and suffer or have suffered from very similar maladies – and so end my long excursion into the domain of abstract ideas.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 73"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>As the living instances most nearly suggesting the diversity of impulse and method, which is my present subject, I have had occasion to draw a comparison between these two peoples, whom, by a singular caprice of antithesis, chance has put into close physical proximity, but nature has sundered as far as the poles in genius, temper and ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Whatever healthy and conservative effects accrue from the close pursuit of either principle, whatever morbid and deleterious effects accrue from the close pursuit of either principle, will be seen operating to the best advantage in the social and political organism of these two nations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The healthy effects of the one impulse we shall find among those striking English qualities which at once catch the eye, insatiable enterprise, an energetic and pushing spirit, a vigorous tendency towards expansion, a high capacity for political administration, and an orderly process of government; the morbid effects are social degradation and an entire absence of the cohesive principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The better qualities have no doubt grown by breathing the atmosphere of individualism and been trained up by the habit of working under settled and roughly convenient forms; but after all is said, the original high qualities of the raw material enter very largely into the credit side of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE"> the account.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Even were it not so, we are not likely, tutored by English instruction, to undervalue or to slur over the successful and imposing aspect of English attainment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Hence it will be more profitable for us, always keeping the bright side in view, to concentrate our attention on the unsounder aspects which we do not care to learn, or if we have learned, are in the habit of carefully forgetting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We may perhaps realize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="24" href="#">1</a> the nature of that unsounder aspect, if we amplify Matthew Arnold’s phrase: – an aristocracy no longer possessed of the imposing nobility of mind, the proud sense of honour, the striking preeminence of faculty, which are the saving graces – nay, which are the very life-breath of an aristocracy; debased moreover by the pursuit, through concession to all that is gross and ignoble in the English mind, of gross and ignoble ends: – a middle class inaccessible to the influence of high and refining ideas, and prone to rate everything even in the noblest departments of life, at a commercial valuation: – and a lower class equally without any germ of high ideas, nay, without any ideas high or low; degraded in their worst failure to the crudest forms of vice, pauperism and crime, and in their highest attainment restricted to a life of unintelligent work relieved by brutalising pleasures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>And indeed the most alarming symptoms are here; for it may be said of the aristocracy that the workings of the Time-Spirit have made a genuine aristocracy obsolete and impracticable, and of the middle class, that, however successful and confident, it is in fact doomed; its empire is passing away from it: but with the whole trend of humanity shaping towards democracy and socialism, on the calibre and civilisation of the lower class depends the future of the entire race.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>And we have seen what sort of lower class England, with all her splendid success, has been able to evolve – in calibre debased, in civilisation nil.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>And after seeing what England has produced by her empiricism, her culture of a raw energy, her exaltation of a political method not founded on reason, we must see what France has produced by her steady, logical pursuit of a fine social ideal: it is the Paris <i>ouvrier</i> with his firmness of grasp on affairs, his sanity, his height of mind, his clear, direct ways of life and thought,– it is the French peasant <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> with his ready tact, his power of quiet and sensible conversation, located in an enjoyable corner of life, small it may be, but with plenty of room for wholesome work and plenty of room for refreshing gaiety.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>There we have the strong side of France, a lucid social atmosphere, a firm executive rationally directed to insure a clearly conceived purpose, a high level of character and refinement pervading all classes and a scheme of society bestowing a fair chance of happiness on the low as well as the high.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But if France is strong in the sphere of England’s weakness, she is no less weak in the sphere of England’s strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Along with and militating against her social happiness, we have to reckon constant political disorder and instability, an alarming defect of expansive vigour, and entire failure in the handling of general politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>France, unable to conceive and work out a proper political machinery, has been reduced to copy with slight variations the English model and import a set of machinery well suited to the old English temper, but now unsuited even to the English and still more to the vehement French character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Passionate, sensitive, loquacious, fond of dispute and apt to be blown away by gusts of feeling, the Gaul is wholly unfit for that heavy decorum, that orderly process of debate, that power of combining anomalies, which still exist to a great extent in England, but which even there must eventually grow impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Hence the vehement French nation after a brief experience of each alien manufacture has grown intensely impatient and shipped it back without superfluous ceremony to its original home.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Here is the latent root of that disheartening failure which has attended France in all her brief and feverish attempts to discover a stable basis of political advance,– of that intense consequent disgust, that scornful aversion to politics which has led thinking France to rate it as an indecent harlequin-show in which no serious man will care to meddle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But if this were all, a superficial observer might balance a defect and merit on one side by an answering merit and defect on the other, and conclude that the account was clear; but social status is not the only department of success in which England compares unfavourably with France.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>There is her fatal incoherency, her want of political cohesion, her want of <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> social cohesion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>A Breton, a Basque, a Provençal, though no less alien in blood to the mass of the French people than the Irish, the Welsh, the Scotch to the mass of the English people, would repel with alarm and abhorrence the mere thought of impairing the fine solidarity, the homogeneity of sentiment, which the possession of an agreeable social life has developed in France.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>And we cannot sufficiently admire the supreme virtue of that fine social development and large diffusion of general happiness, which has conserved for France in the midst of fearful political calamities her splendid cohesiveness as a nation and as a community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>In England on the other hand we see the sorry spectacle of a great empire lying at the mercy of disintegrating influences, because the component races have neither been properly merged in the whole nor persuaded by the offer of a high level of happiness to value the benefits of solidarity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>And if France by her injudicious choice of mechanism, her political incapacity, her refusal to put her best blood into politics, has involved herself in fearful political calamities, no less has England by her exclusive pursuit of machinery, her social incompetence, her prejudice against a rational equality, her excessive individualism, entered on an era of fearful social calamities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is a suggestive fact that the alienation of sympathy, the strong antipathetic feelings of Labour towards Capital, are nowhere so marked, the quarrel between them is nowhere so violent, sustained and ferocious as in the two countries which are proudest of their institutions and have most systematically neglected their social development – England and America.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>It is not therefore unreasonable to conclude – and had I space and leisure, I should be tempted to show that every circumstance tends to fortify the conclusion and convert it into a certainty – that this social neglect is the prime cause of the fearful array of social calamities, whose first impact has already burst on those proud and successful countries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>But enough has been said, and to discuss the matter exhaustively would unduly defer the point of more direct importance for ourselves; – I mean the ominous connection which these truths have with the actual conditions of politics and society in India.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We need not marvel if England, overconfident in her material success and the practical value of her institutions has concerned herself too little with social development and set small store by the discreet management of her masses: nor must we hold French judgment cheap because in the pursuit of social felicity and the pride of her magnificent cohesion France has failed in her choice of apparatus and courted political insecurity and disaster.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>At any rate I hope to have enforced on my readers the precise and intrinsic meaning of that count in my indictment which censures the Congress as a body not popular and not honestly desirous of a popular character – in fact as a middle-class organ selfish and disingenuous in its public action and hollow in its professions of a large and disinterested patriotism.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>But then Mr. Pherozshah is a lawyer: he has, enormously developed in him, that forensic instinct which prompts men to fight out a cause which they know to be unsound, to fight it out to the last gasp, not because it is just or noble but because it is theirs; and in the spirit of that forensic tradition he may conceivably undertake to answer me somewhat as follows.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>“Material success and a great representative assembly are boons of so immense a magnitude, so stupendous an importance that even if we purchase them at the cost of a more acute disintegration, a more appalling social decadence, the rate will not be any too exorbitant.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>But I have not done enough when I have done that.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Perversion or error in the philosophy of our aim does indeed point to a serious defect of the political reason, but it is not incompatible with a nearer apprehension and happier management of surface facts; and if we had been so far apprehensive and dexterous, that would have been an output of native directness and force on which we might reasonably felicitate ourselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>For directness and force are an inalienable ancestral inheritance handed down by vigorous forefathers, and where they are, the political reason which comes of liberal culture and ancient experience, may be waited for with a certain patient hopefulness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But it is to be feared that our performance up to date does not give room for so comforting an assurance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Is it not rather the fact that our whole range of thought and action has been pervaded by a stamp of unreality and helplessness, a straining after achievement for which we have not the proper stamina and an entire misconception of facts as well as of natural laws?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>To be convinced of this we have only to interrogate recent events, not confiding in their outward face as the shallow and self-contented do, but getting to the heart of them, making sure of their hidden secret, their deeper reality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Indeed it will not hurt any of us to put out of sight for a moment those vain and fantastic chimeras about Simon de Montfort and the gradual evolution of an Indian Parliament, with which certain politicians are fond of amusing us, and look things straight in the face.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We must resolutely hold fast to the primary fact that right and effective action can only ensue upon a right understanding of ourselves in relation to our environment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>For by reflection or instinct to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="PE"> get a clear insight into our position and by dexterity to make the most of it, that is the whole secret of politics, and that is just what we have failed to do.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Let us see whether we cannot get some adequate sense of what our position really is: after that we shall be more in the way to hit closely the exact point at which we have failed.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 87"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Whatever theatrical attitude it may suit our vanity to adopt, we are not, as we pretend to be, the embodiment of the country’s power, intelligence and worth: neither are we disinterested patriots striving in all purity and unselfishness towards an issue irreproachable before God.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>These are absurd pretensions which only detract from the moral height of our nature and can serve no great or serious end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We may gain a poor and evanescent advantage by this sort of hypocrisy, but we lose in candour and clearness of intellect, we lose in sincerity which is another name for strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>If we would only indulge less our bias towards moral ostentation and care more to train ourselves in a healthy robustness and simple candour, it would really advantage us not only in character, but in power; and it would have this good effect, that we should no longer throw dust into our own eyes; we should be better fitted to see ourselves as a critic of human society would see us, better able to get that clear insight into our own position, which is one condition of genuine success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>No, we are not and cannot be a body of disinterested patriots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Life being, as science tells us, an affirmation of one’s self, any aggregate mass of humanity must inevitably strive to emerge and affirm its own essence, must by the law of its own nature aspire towards life, aspire towards expansion, aspire towards the perfecting<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="29" href="#">1</a> of its potential strength in the free air of political recognition and the full light of political predominance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>That is just what has been happening in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In us the Indian burgess or middle-class emerges from obscurity, perhaps from nothingness, and strives between a strong and unfeeling bureaucracy and an inert and imbecile proletariate to possess itself of rank, consideration and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Against that striving it is futile to protest; one might as well quarrel with the law of gravitation; but though our striving must be inherently selfish, we can at least make some small effort to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 54</p>
<p class="PE"> keep it as little selfish as possible, to make it, as far as may be, run in harness with the grand central interests of the nation at large.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>So much at least those of us who have a broad human affection for our country as distinct from ourselves, have a right to expect.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 88"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Thus emergent, thus ambitious, it was our business by whatever circumstances we were environed, to seize hold of those circumstances and make ourselves masters of them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The initial difficulties were great.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>A young and just emergent body without experience of government, without experience even of resistance to government, consequently without inherited tact, needs a teacher or a Messiah to initiate it in the art of politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>In England the burgess was taught almost insensibly by the nobility; in France he found a Messiah in the great Napoleon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We had no Napoleon, but we had a nobility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Europeans, when the spirit moves them to brag of their superiority over us Asiatics, are in the habit of saying that the West is progressive, the East stationary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>That is a little too comprehensive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>England and France are no doubt eminently progressive, but there are other countries of Europe which have not been equally forward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>America is a democratic country which has not progressed: Russia is a despotic country which has not progressed: in Italy, Spain, Germany even progress has been factitious and slow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, though the vulgar wording of the boast may be loose and careless, yet it does express<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="30" href="#">2</a> a very real superiority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The nations of the West are not all progressive, true; but they are all in that state which is the first condition of progress, a state, I mean, of fluidity, but of fluidity within limits, fluidity on a stable and normal basis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>If no spirit of thought or emotion moves on the face of the waters, they become as foul and stagnant as in the most conservative parts of Asia, but a very slight wind will set them flowing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In most Asiatic countries,– I do not speak of India – one might almost imagine a hurricane blowing without any perceptible effect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Accordingly in Europe the transition of power from the noble to the burgess has been natural and inevitable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>In India, just as naturally and inevitably, the administration remained with the noble.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The old Hindu mechanism of society and government certainly did prescribe limits, certainly </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 55</p>
<p class="PE"> had a basis that was stable and normal; but it was too rigid, too stationary: it bound down the burgess and held him in his place by an iron weight of custom and religious ordinance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The regime that overthrew and succeeded it, the Mussulman regime, was mediaeval in character, fluid certainly, indeed in a perpetual state of flux, but never able to shake off the curse of instability, never in a position to prescribe limits, never stable, never normal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>In such a society the qualities which make for survival, are valour, dexterity, initiative, swiftness, a robust immorality, qualities native to an aristocracy and to nations moulded by an aristocracy, native also to certain races, but even in those nations, even in those races, alien to the ordinary spirit of the burgess.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>His ponderous movements, his fumbling, his cold timidity, his decent scrupulousness have been fatal to his pretensions, at times inimical to his existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Accordingly in India he has been submerged, scarcely existent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Great affairs and the high qualities they nourish have rested in the hand of the noble.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>We had then our nobility, our class trained and experienced in government and affairs: but to them unhappily we could not possibly look for guidance or even for co-operation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>At the period of our emergence they were lethargic, effete, moribund, partially sunk in themselves; and even if any of the old energy had survived their fall, the world in which they moved was too new and strange, the transition to it had been too sudden and confounding to admit of their assimilating themselves so as to move with ease and success under novel conditions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>The old nobility was quite as helpless from decay and dotage, as we from youthful inexperience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>It was foreign energy that had pushed aside the old outworn machinery, it was an alien government that had by policy and self-will hurried us into a new and quite unfamiliar world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Would that government, politic and self-willed as it was, help us to an activity that might, nay, that must turn eventually to their personal detriment?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Certainly they had the power but quite as certainly they had not the will.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>They are in the unlucky position of responsibility for a state of things which they abhor and certainly had no intention of bringing about.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The force which they had in mind to construct was a body of grave, loyal and conservative citizens, educated but without ideas, a body created by and having a stake in the present order, and therefore attached to its continuance, a power in the land certainly, but a power for order, for permanence, not a power for disturbance and unrest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>In such an enterprise they were bound to fail and they failed egregiously.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Sir Edwin Arnold when he found out that it was a grievous mistake to occidentalize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="32" href="#">4</a> us, forgot, no doubt, for the moment his role as the preacher and poetaster of self-abnegation, and spoke as an ordinary mundane being, the prophet of a worldly and selfish class: but if we accept his words in that sense, there can be no doubt that he was perfectly right.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Anglo-Indians had never seriously brought themselves to believe that we are in blood and disposition a genuine Aryan community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>They chose to regard our history as a jungle of meaningless facts, and could not understand that we were not malleable dead matter, but men with Occidental impulses in our blood, not virgin material to be wrought into any shape they preferred, but animate beings with a principle of life in us and certain, if subjected to the same causes, placed in the same light and air as European communities, to exhibit effects precisely similar and shape ourselves rather than be shaped.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>The habit, set in vogue by rhetoricians of Macaulay’s type, of making large professions of benevolence invested with an air of high grandiosity, has become so much a second nature with them, that I will not ask if they are sincere <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> when they make them: but it is a rhetorical habit and nothing more.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>If they had seen things as they really are, they would have been wisely inactive: but they wanted a submissive and attached population, and they thought they had hit on the best way of getting what they wanted.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>But we must not be surprised or indignant if the Anglo-Indians, when they saw their confidence so rudely dashed and themselves confronted, not with submission and attachment but with a body eager, pushing, recriminative, pushing for recognition, pushing for power, covetous above all of that authority which they had come to regard as their private and peculiar possession,– there is no cause for surprise or resentment, if they cared little for the grain of success in their bushelful of failure, and regarded us with those feelings of alarm, distrust and hatred which Frankenstein experienced when having hoped to make a man, he saw a monster.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 93"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The Civilian Order, which accounts itself, and no doubt justly, the informing spirit of Anglo-India, is credited in this country with quite an extraordinary degree of ability and merit, so much so that many believe it to have come down to us direct from heaven.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>And it is perhaps on this basis that in their dealings with Indians,– whom being moulded of a clay entirely terrestrial, one naturally supposes to be an inferior order of creatures,– they permit themselves a very liberal tinge of presumption and arrogance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Without disputing their celestial origin, one may perhaps be suffered to hint that eyes unaffected by the Indian sun, will be hard put to it to discover the pervading soul of magnificence and princeliness in the moral and intellectual style of these demigods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The fact is indeed all the other way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The general run of the Service suffers by being recruited through the medium of Competitive Examination: its tone is a little vulgar, its character a little raw, its achievement a little second-rate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Harsh critics have indeed said more than this; nay, has not one of themselves, has not Mr. Rudyard Kipling, a blameless Anglo-Indian, spoken, and spoken with distressing emphasis to the same effect?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>They have said that it moves in an atmosphere of unspeakable boorishness and mediocrity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>That is certainly strong language and I would not for a moment be thought to endorse it; but there is, as I say, just a small sediment of truth at the bottom which may tend to excuse, if not to justify, this harsh and unfriendly criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>And when one knows the stuff of which the Service is made, one ceases to wonder at it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>A shallow schoolboy stepping from a cramming establishment to the command of high and difficult affairs, can hardly be expected to give us anything magnificent or princely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Still less can it be expected when the sons of small tradesmen are suddenly promoted from the counter to govern great provinces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Not that I have any fastidious prejudice against </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 59</p>
<p class="PE"> small tradesmen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>I simply mean that the best education men of that class can get in England, does not adequately qualify a raw youth to rule over millions of his fellow-beings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Bad in training, void of culture, in instruction poor, it is in plain truth a sort of education that leaves him with all his original imperfections on his head, unmannerly, uncultivated, unintelligent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But in the Civil Service, with all its vices and shortcomings, one does find, as perhaps one does not find elsewhere, rare and exalted souls detached from the failings of their order, who exhibit the qualities of the race in a very striking way; not geniuses certainly, but swift and robust personalities, rhetorically powerful, direct, forcible, endowed to a surprising extent with the energy and self-confidence which are the heirlooms of their nation; men in short who give us England – and by England I mean the whole Anglo-Celtic race – on her really high and admirable side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Many of these are Irish or Caledonian; others are English gentlemen of good blood and position, trained at the great public schools, who still preserve that fine flavour of character, scholarship and power, which was once a common possession in England, but threatens under the present dispensation to become sparse or extinct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Others again are veterans of the old Anglo-Indian school, moulded in the larger traditions and sounder discipline of a strong and successful art who still keep some vestiges of the grand old Company days, still have something of a great and noble spirit, something of an adequate sense how high are the affairs they have to deal with and how serious the position they are privileged to hold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It was one of these, one endowed with all their good gifts, it was Mr. Allan Hume, a man acute and vigorous, happy in action and in speech persuasive, an ideal leader, who prompted, it may be by his own humane and lofty feelings, it may be by a more earthly desire of present and historic fame, took us by the hand and guided us with astonishing skill on our arduous venture towards preeminence and power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Mr. Hume, I have said, had all the qualities that go to make a fine leader in action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If only he had added to these the crowning gifts, reflectiveness, ideas, a comprehensive largeness of vision!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Governing force, that splendid distinction inherited by England from her old Norman <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> barons, governing force and the noble gifts that go along with it, are great things in their way, but they are not the whole of politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Ideas, reflection, the political reason count for quite as much, are quite as essential.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But on these, though individual Englishmen, men like Bolingbroke, Arnold, Burke, have had them preeminently, the race has always kept a very inadequate hold: and Mr. Hume is distinguished from his countrymen, not by the description of his merits, but by their degree.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>His original conception, I cannot help thinking, was narrow and impolitic.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 94"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>He must have known, none better, what immense calamities may often be ripening under a petty and serene outside.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>He must have been aware, none better, when the fierce pain of hunger and oppression cuts to the bone what awful elemental passions may start to life in the mildest, the most docile proletariates.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Yet he chose practically to ignore his knowledge; he conceived it as his business to remove a merely political inequality, and strove to uplift the burgess into a merely isolated predominance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>That the burgess should strive towards predominance, nay, that for a brief while he should have it, is only just, only natural: the mischief of it was that in Mr. Hume’s formation the proletariate remained for any practical purpose a piece off the board.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Yet the proletariate is, as I have striven to show, the real key of the situation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Torpid he is and immobile; he is nothing of an actual force, but he is a very great potential force, and whoever succeeds in understanding and eliciting his strength, becomes by the very fact master of the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Our situation is indeed complex and difficult beyond any that has ever been imagined by the human intellect; but if there is one thing clear in it, it is that the right and fruitful policy for the burgess, the only policy that has any chance of eventual success, is to base his cause upon an adroit management of the proletariate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>He must awaken and organize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="33" href="#">1</a> the entire power of the country and thus multiply infinitely his volume and significance, the better to attain a supremacy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="34" href="#">2</a> as much social as political.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Thus and thus only will he attain to his legitimate station, not an egoist class living for itself and in itself, but the crown of the nation and its head.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 95"><!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Hume saw things in a different light, and let me </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="PE"> confess out of hand, that once he had got a clear conception of his business, he proceeded in it with astonishing rapidity, sureness and tact.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The clear-cut ease and strong simplicity of his movements were almost Roman; no crude tentatives, no infelicitous bungling, but always a happy trick of hitting the right nail on the head and that at the first blow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Roman too was his principle of advancing to a great object by solid and consecutive gradations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>To begin by accustoming the burgess as well as his adversaries to his own corporate reality, to proceed by a definitive statement of his case to the Vice-regal Government, and for a final throw to make a vehement and powerful appeal to the English Parliament, an appeal that should be financed by the entire resources of middle-class India and carried through its stages with an iron heart and an obdurate resolution, expending moreover infinite energy,– so and so only could the dubious road Mr. Hume was treading, lead to anything but bathos and anticlimax.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Nothing could be happier than the way in which the initial steps were made out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>To be particularly obstreperous about his merits and his wrongs is certainly the likeliest way for a man to get a solid idea of his own importance and make an unpleasant impression on his ill-wishers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>And for that purpose, for a blowing of trumpets in concert, for a self-assertion persistent, bold and clamorous, the Congress, however incapable in other directions may be pronounced perfectly competent; nay, it was the ideal thing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>The second step was more difficult.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>He had to frame somehow a wording of our case at once bold and cautious, so as to hit Anglo-India in its weak place, yet properly sauced so as not to offend the palate, grown fastidious and epicurean, of the British House of Commons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Delicate as was the task he managed it with indubitable adroitness and a certain success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We may perhaps get at the inner sense of what happened, if we imagine Mr. Hume giving this sort of ultimatum to the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>“The Indian burgess for whose education you have provided but whose patrimony you sequestrated and are woefully mismanaging, having now come to years of discretion, demands an account of your stewardship and the future management of his own estate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>To compromise, if you <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> are so good as to meet us half-way, we are not unready, but on any other hypothesis our appeal lies at once to the tribunal of the British Parliament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>You will observe our process is perfectly constitutional.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The sting of the scorpion lay as usual in its tail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Mr. Hume knew well the magic power of that word over Englishmen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>With a German garrison it would have been naught; they would quickly have silenced with bayonets and prohibitive decrees any insolence of that sort.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>With French republicans it would have been naught; they would either have powerfully put it aside or frankly acceded to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>But the English are a nation of political jurists, and any claim franked by the epithet “constitutional” they are bound by the very law of their being to respect or at any rate appear to respect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The common run of Anglo-Indians, blinded as selfishness always does blind people, might in their tremulous rage and panic vomit charges of sedition and shout for open war; but a Government of political jurists pledged to an occidentalizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="35" href="#">3</a> policy could not do so without making nonsense of its past.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Moreover a Government vice-regal in constitution cannot easily forget that it may have to run the gauntlet of adverse comment from authorities at home.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>But if they could not put us down with the strong hand or meet our delegates with a <i>non possumus</i>, they were not therefore going to concede to us any solid fraction of our demands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>It is the ineradicable vice of the English nature that it can never be clear or direct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It recoils from simplicity as from a snake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>It must shuffle, it must turn in on itself, it must preserve cherished fictions intact.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>And supposing unpleasant results to be threatened, it escapes from them through a labyrinth of unworthy and transparent subterfuges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Our rulers are unfortunately average Englishmen, Englishmen, that is to say, who are not in the habit of rising superior to themselves; and if they were uncandid, if they were tortuously hostile we may be indignant, but we cannot be surprised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Mr. Hume at any rate saw quite clearly that nothing was to be expected, perhaps he had never seriously expected anything, from that quarter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>He had already instituted with really admirable promptitude, the primary stages of his appeal to the British Parliament.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Partition or Annihilation?</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 139"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>In the excitement and clamour that has followed the revolutionary proposal of Lord Curzon’s Government to break Bengal into pieces, there is some danger of the new question being treated only in its superficial aspects and the grave and startling national peril for which it is the preparation being either entirely missed or put out of sight.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>On a perusal of the telegrams which pour in from Eastern Bengal one is struck with the fact that they mainly deal with certain obvious and present results of the measure, not one of which is really vital.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The contention repeatedly harped on that Assam is entirely different to us in race, language, manners etc. is in the first place not altogether true, and even if true, is very bad political strategy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In these days when the whole tendency of a reactionary Government is to emphasize old points of division<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="45" href="#">2</a> and create new ones, it should plainly be the policy of the national movement to ignore points of division and to emphasize old and create new points of contact and union.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The Assamese possess the same racial substratum as ourselves though the higher strata may be less profoundly Aryanised and their language is a branch of Bengali which but for an artificial diversion would have merged into the main stream of Bengali speech.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Why then should we affront our brothers in Assam and play the game of our opponents by declaring them outcast from our sympathies?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The loss by Eastern Bengal of a seat on the Legislative Council is again the loss of a delusion and does not really concern its true national welfare.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Even separation from the Calcutta High Court if it should come about, means very little now that the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 71</p>
<p class="PE"> High Court has definitely ceased to protect the liberties of the people and become an informal department of the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The dislocation of trade caused by its diversion from Calcutta to Chittagong might be a calamity of the first magnitude to Calcutta but its evil effects on Eastern Bengal would, the enemy might well argue, be of a very temporary character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The transfer of advanced provinces to a backward Government is, no doubt, in itself a vital objection to the measure but can be at once met by elevating the new province to the dignity of a Lieutenant-Governorship with a Legislative Council and a Chief Court.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Indeed by this very simple though costly contrivance the Government can meet every practical objection of a political nature that has been urged against their proposal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>There are signs which seem to indicate that this is the expedient to which Government will eventually resort and under the cover of it affect an even more extended amputation than it was at first convenient to announce; for Rajshahi as well as Faridpur and Backergunge<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="46" href="#">3</a>, are it appears also to be cut away from us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>There would remain the violation of Bengali sentiment and the social disturbance and mortal inconvenience to innumerable individuals which must inevitably accompany such a disruption of old ties and interests and severance from the grand<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="47" href="#">4</a> centre of Bengali life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But our sentiments the Government can very well afford to ignore and the disturbance and inconvenience they may politely regret as deplorable incidents indeed but after all minor and temporary compared with the great and permanent administrative necessities to be satisfied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Will then the people of Eastern Bengal finally, seeing the Government determined, pocket the bribe of a separate Lieutenant-Governorship, a Legislative Council and High Court and accept this violent revolution in our national life?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Or will Western Bengal submit to lose Eastern Bengal on such terms?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>If not, then to nerve them for the struggle their refusal will involve they must rely on something deeper than sentiment, something more potent than social and personal interests, they must have the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="48" href="#">5</a> clear and indelible consciousness of the truth that this measure is no mere administrative proposal but a blow straight at the heart of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The failure to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> voice clearly this, the true and vital side of the question can arise only from want of moral courage or from that fatal inability to pass beyond superficialities and details and understand in their fulness deep truths and grand issues in politics, which has made our political life for the last fifty years so miserably barren and ineffective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>That it springs largely if not altogether from the latter is evidenced by the amazing apathy which allows Western Bengal to sit with folded hands and allow Eastern Bengal to struggle alone and unaided.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Eastern Bengal is menaced with absorption into a backward province and therefore struggles; Western Bengal is menaced with no such calamity and can therefore sit lolling on its pillows, hookah-pipe in hand, waiting to see what happens; this apparently is how the question is envisaged by a race which considers itself the most intelligent and quick witted in the world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>That it is something far other than this, that the danger involved is far<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="49" href="#">6</a> more urgent and appalling, is what I shall try to point out in this article.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 140"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately, to do this is impossible without treading on Lord Curzon’s corns and indeed on the tenderest of all the crop.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We have recently been permitted to know that our great Viceroy particularly objects to the imputation of motives to his Government – and not unnaturally; for Lord Curzon is a vain man loving praise and sensitive to dislike and censure; more than that, he is a statesman of unusual genius who is following a subtle and daring policy on which immense issues hang and it is naturally disturbing him to find that there are wits in India as subtle as his own which can perceive something at least of the goal at which he is aiming.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But in this particular instance he has only himself and Mr. Risley to thank, if his motives have been discovered – or let us say, misinterpreted.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 243"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>[..... if the] natural disparity which is so confidently asserted by Europeans and reasserted in echo by not a few Anglicised or revolted Hindus, be a truth and not a fiction of racial pride, the national movement in India becomes a blunder and a solecism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>For this movement proceeds on two assertions which the European position directly traverses, the natural equality of the Asiatic to the European, which justifies us in aspiring to liberty and the control of our own destinies and the immense superiority of our own religion, ethics and social ideals to the Western.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>In traffic with the West we seek only to import the scientific knowledge, the mechanical apparatus of war and communication and the method of efficient organisation in Government which have made it so eminently formidable, but we wish to bar out, if may be, all that disease of the intellect and social constitution born of individualistic materialism which makes it so eminently miserable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If we are right, our spiritual and moral strength without which material greatness cannot endure lies in the use and development of our own religion and ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Otherwise, our whole aspiration is an unhealthy dream and there is no reason in Nature why we should not remain for ever the subjects and servants of European races with an occasional change of masters as our sole relief in the long monotony of servitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is therefore essential for us to know the truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>In the following pages I have sought to provide the materials for a correct judgment, aiming chiefly at a right presentation of the spirit and truth of our ancient philosophy, religion and ethics, which have hitherto been presented to the world by European expositors who show at every step their imperfect and often </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 94</p>
<p class="PE"> utterly erroneous understanding of what they pretend to explain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is necessary to understand aright before we praise or condemn; and the ethical aspect of Hinduism is like everything Hindu so much a part and a thing of itself that it is only those of whose blood and bone it has become a part who can be trusted to put it before others from a right perspective and in the true proportions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Only then can the issue between the East and West be justly decided.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Chapter I. The Ethical Basis in Europe</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 244"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Morality is like all else in this world of perceptions, phenomenal in its nature; it is neither eternal nor unchanging, but depends on two things, that in which it lives and moves and the conditions that surround and work upon its receptacle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is true that certain virtues, purity, humanity, truth, self-sacrifice are at present vaguely recognized as moral standards by all civilized peoples; but they were not recognized at all times and places in the past and there is no guarantee that they will be recognized at all times and places in the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Moreover the definite meaning and extent of these names and the limits within which men are willing to honour them in practical life, varies immensely in different countries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The standard of morality is determined not by the profession of the community, but by the actual though unwritten code of actions which the community as a whole strives to practise and which, even if it does not succeed in attaining, it honestly approves and honours in those who do attain it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Indeed the extraordinary variations and flat contradiction of the ethical standard as determined by place and time, has become so much a commonplace that it is hardly worth while to dwell upon it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The no less extraordinary variations and flat contradictions of the ethical standard as practised in the same place and the same time, have not received so much attention, and yet they are of even greater psychological value.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The determining forces are always two, the adhara or receptacle or field and the conditions which act on the receptacle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The field of morality is triple, the individual, the collective mind of the community, race, nation or body of nations that profess it and the collective mind of all humanity, the latter attaining especial importance in these days when all parts of the world are in some sort of touch with each other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The conditions which act on it are the various physical and other influences which have acted or are now acting on the individual and collective mind and most of all its spiritual history.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Objects</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 252"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>1. I propose that a permanent sample-room should be maintained by the Baroda Industrial Association in its own offices, fulfilling the following purposes<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 253"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>(1) an ocular demonstration to the public and the merchants of the number and kind of goods they can have from their own country;<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 254"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>(2) a standing advertisement of Swadeshi articles procurable in the local market;<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 255"><!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>(3) a register of information available to all interested in the industrial development of the country.<!--/SENT--></p>
<h1 class="Cp-Nm"><!--SENT-->Means of providing the Sample-room at a minimum expense</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 256"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>2. The sample-room should be begun on a modest scale and gradually enlarged in its scope.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The Sub-Committee should see that no means of saving expense should be spared consistently with the usefulness of the institution.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 257"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>3. The saving of expense may be effected in various ways.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 258"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>In the first place the Committee should at first confine itself only to those articles which are in daily or common use and therefore essential to the needs or comfort of the general population.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 259"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>4. Having fixed on the kind of articles to which it will limit itself, the Committee will first inquire what goods, e.g. clothes etc. can be had through the local merchants and obtain samples from them gratis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>As the sample-room will be in its </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 98</p>
<p class="PE"> secondary character a free advertisement for the merchants, they will probably be glad enough to seize the opportunity.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 260"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>5. Again the Committee should draw up a circular (typewritten) stating the objects of the sample-room, pointing out that it will be a free advertisement introducing all goods sent there to the local market, and inviting manufacturers to send samples.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>This announcement may also be made in the local papers as well as one or two widely circulated journals outside.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The circular may, if necessary, be franked by responsible persons holding good positions in order to assure the manufacturers etc. of the <i>bona-fides</i> of the institution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If so assured, they will probably be quite willing to secure an advertisement by sending their samples gratis; for it must be remembered that the goods will be mostly of a common order and therefore cheap.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 261"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>6. Still farther to lighten the burden, the Association may approach the authorities to make an exception as to <i>Jakat</i> in the case of articles sent for the sample-room and certified by responsible officers of the Association.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 262"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>7. In the case of samples required which are not sent by the manufacturer on the general invitation, a special request may be made to him to afford this facility to the Association.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 263"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>8. Only in case these methods fail, the Committee will be entitled in case of necessity to purchase samples.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In this way the cost of providing the sample-room will be kept at a minimum.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 264"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>9. It will be the business of the Information Committee to see that the sample-room is kept up to date.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 266"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>11. This rule however should not prevent the extension of the scope of the sample-room when funds and opportunity permit.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Sir Andrew Fraser, hampered with the traditions of legality and bureaucratic formalism, has begun cautiously, thundering loudly but sparing the lightning flash.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Mr. Fuller, violent, rude and truculent in character and accustomed to the autocracy of a non-regulated province, has rushed like a mad bull at the obnoxious object; his violence may or may not temporarily defeat itself by compelling the Government of India or the Secretary of State to intervene, but even should this happen it will make little difference.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>A headstrong and violent man, presuming insufferably on the high position to which an inscrutable Providence has suffered him to climb, summons the leaders of a spirited community, men of culture, worth and dignity, strong in the trust and support of the people, and after subjecting them to insults of an unprecedented grossness compels them at the point of the bludgeon to withdraw a public appeal which their position </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>And if as a result Mr. Fuller were immediately to send them to the prison, or the whipping post, or the gallows itself, what difference would that make to their duty as public men and national leaders?<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Our contemporary, it appears, has heard that some people propose to put forward Mr. Tilak’s name as President of the next Congress, and it hastens to point out how extremely distasteful the idea is to all thoughtful and enlightened men, that is to say, to all whose views agree with the <i>Mirror</i>’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak, we learn, has seriously offended our contemporary by giving honour to Mr. Bhopatkar on his release from jail; his speeches on the occasion of the Shivaji festival were displeasing to the thoughtful and enlightened men who congregate in the office of the <i>Indian Mirror</i>; and to sum up the whole matter, he is a man of extreme views and without “tact”.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is not the one man whom the whole Hindu community in Western India delights to honour, from Peshawar to Kolhapur and from Bombay to our own borders; it is one who will not talk about Shivaji and Bhavani – only about Mahatmas.<!--/SENT-->

Bengal</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 332"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Englishman</i> and those who are evidently anxious to set the machinery of relentless state prosecutions against the leaders of the present national movement in this province, need not take so much trouble to prove that there is considerable disaffection and disloyalty in East Bengal which ought at once to be put down with a strong hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Our contemporary must be far more simple-minded than what one should expect him to be, judging both from his general education and experience and his position as an intelligent observer and critic of current affairs, if he ever thought that there could be any real affection and loyalty to an alien despotism, such as the present Government in this country undoubtedly is, in the minds of the subject populations in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Lord Curzon once declared that though differing in colour and culture, the Indians were as much human as the Britishers, and had the same sentiments and susceptibilities that the British people had.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If the <i> Englishman</i> and his friends believe in this common humanity of the Indian, they have simply to place themselves mentally in the position of their “native fellow-subjects”, to realise the kind of affection and loyalty for the present Government that can ever be felt by the people of this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Indeed, loyalty as a feeling of personal love and regard for the sovereign is an extinct virtue in civilisation, and, if it is not found in countries where the sovereign belongs to the people, and lives and stands among them as the head of their State and the fountain of all social honour, and where the people always participate in his glory, his magnificence and his wealth,– each according to his status and qualification,– how much more rare must it be in a country like India whose sovereign belongs </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 120</p>
<p class="PE"> to a distant country and an alien race, who professes an alien religion, who is not related to the people by any ties of tradition or past historic associations, and in the glories and prerogatives of whose throne, as well as in the wealth and magnificence of whose empire, these people have neither lot nor part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>To believe the barest possibility of any true loyalty in India is really to take the Indians to be very much less than human.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But, in truth, nobody ever honestly believed in it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Loyalty has ever been a mere convenient tie in this country – convenient to the ruler because the reputation for profound loyalty of the Indian people keeps foreign enemies away; convenient to the ruled because like charity it covereth a multitude of political sins.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But in truth no one ever really believed in this much-proclaimed virtue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>No Englishman ever honestly believed in the truth of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>No Indian ever cherished it honestly himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Both the rulers and the ruled have been playing at blind man’s buff all these years with this great civic virtue, each seeking to make some political capital out of it.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 333"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>That the British Government in India never set a two-pence value on the loyalty of their Indian subjects,– though they are always anxious to proclaim it from the housetops, as a magnificent charm to keep away the evil-eye – is proved by the entire history of their past transactions with us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The Arms Act surely does not prove England’s faith in India’s loyalty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Frenchman, the German, the American, nay, even the Negro and the Hottentot,– indeed every foreigner can possess arms and bear them in India without a licence; the man who belongs to the country and who is most interested in its prosperity and peace, alone cannot do so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The systematic exclusion of the people of the land, however qualified they may be, from all positions of exceptional trust and responsibility in what ought, by the law of God and nature alike, to be their own Government, surely does not prove that English statesmen ever honestly believed in the allegiance of the Indian people to their rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The methods of state-regulated education, which carefully eschew every training or text book or instruction that is calculated to quicken any genuine love of freedom or any noble patriotism in the pupils; the extreme anxiety of the authorities to train the youths of this </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 121</p>
<p class="PE"> country in habits of gentleness and subordination, while in their own country every form of manliness and even rowdyism as long as it does not strike against the very soul of social and civic orders are not only tolerated, but frequently encouraged by the leaders of public opinion and the custodians of public morals; the denial of the commonest right of free citizenship,– the right of free participation in public meetings having for their object the reform of the Administration,– to the commonest of public servants; the crusade against every form of patriotic efforts on the part of the people, such as are calculated to inspire them with devotion to their nation, all these go distinctly to prove at what value the much proclaimed loyalty of the people of this country is really rated by their foreign masters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The fact really is that loyalty in the sense in which the term is usually used,– either in the old sense of loving attachment to the person or throne of the sovereign, or even in the new and higher sense of devotion to the State which reveals and realises the highest civic ideals and aspirations of the subjects,– cannot naturally exist or grow in a country that is subject to the domination of another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>No Englishman therefore honestly believes in it in India, however much he may be anxious to conjure it up in times of trouble or difficulty as a saving magic working for his safety and salvation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Loyalty, in the general acceptance of the term, has been a mere myth in British India; and the <i>Englishman</i> need not be at so much pains to disprove the presence of a thing in East Bengal that had never as yet existed in any part of the country subject to British rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Disloyalty is want of loyalty, and there cannot be anywhere an absence of a thing,– as a new fact,– where that thing had never existed before.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 334"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But if loyalty is not possible in India in its present condition of servitude, what then is the secret of that unquestioning obedience to the authority of the present alien Government in the country, which alone makes it easy and possible for them to rule so vast a population with such slender means?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The answer is plain and obvious: it is not affection, neither is it disaffection, both of which are active sentiments, but mere indifference, mere listlessness, the fatuous fatalism of the Hindu and the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 122</p>
<p class="PE"> Mahomedan populations of India that keeps them so easily under British subjection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Not loyalty, not allegiance, but mere passive acquiescence,– that is the word which sums up the real attitude of the Indian people towards their foreign master and the outlandish civic order they have established in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>This acquiescence is due to a general belief – now rapidly being undermined and destroyed by the open excesses and repressions of recent administrations – in the benevolence of the British despotism, itself the result of a strange hypnotic spell that British politicians and statesmen of the earlier generations had cast over the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>If by loyalty is meant this passive acquiescence to the existing civic order in the country, there is still considerable loyalty in the country, though the events of the past five or six years have done much to disturb even this passive sentiment in the people.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 335"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But there has always been another kind of loyalty also in this country, and that species of loyalty exists still among us, both in East Bengal and West Bengal, though it has been subjected during the last eight or nine months to a strain which would kill it altogether in any other country, and most of all in that country to which the <i>Englishman</i> himself belongs, and this kind of loyalty will last as long as the Government and those whose views the <i>Englishman</i> represents, do not themselves destroy it with their own hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Loyalty in the radical sense of the term, derived from <i>lex</i> – law, and meaning obedience to law – has always been a cordial characteristic of our people; and in this sense people have always been loyal in this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>This loyalty – this extreme regard for law of the Indian population – has been the strongest bulwark of the present foreign despotism in this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>We are still loyal, as we have been in the past, in the sense of law-abiding.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Had we not been loyal in this, the truest sense of the term, the history of British administration in every part of India would have to be very differently written indeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>In fact the <i>Englishman</i> ought not to forget that it is this extreme loyalty of the people that saved the situation created in Barisal and elsewhere by the lawless excesses of the executive Government during the last nine or ten months.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Had our people </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 123</p>
<p class="PE"> been less law-abiding than they are, the whole country would have long ago been completely given over to riots and mob-rule, which it would tax the entire strength and resources of the Government to grapple with and conquer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The lawless excesses of the Executive and the Police in East Bengal during the last eight or nine months, are matters of common knowledge; and the <i>Englishman</i> knows it full well that there is no other country in the world where such wanton oppression and injustice would have been so quietly borne by the people as these have been borne in the New Province.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>To attribute this to the cowardice of the people would be an act of fatal folly on the part of the Government or their advisers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>East Bengal, at least, has never been noted for such cowardice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is not fear, but self-restraint due to considerations of larger and higher interests, and the command of their leaders that kept East Bengal so quiet under all these enormities during the last nine or ten months.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>But this loyalty also seems apparently to be giving way now, for it is useless to conceal the fact that a grim determination has gradually grown among the people to no longer suffer any illegal excesses, in the way they have been suffered so long.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But even in this new spirit of resistance in the people there is no lack of regard for law, for this new determination means not to outrage but to protect the honour and dignity of the law itself, when both are openly outraged by those whose duty it is to protect them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>If this be disloyalty, we freely admit this disloyalty exists, and is growing to great proportions in every part of the country; and the threats of the <i>Englishman</i> or the setting of the sedition-law in motion will not kill, but only increase this disloyalty the more.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>They reveal to us, first and foremost, as many incidents of the Swadeshi movement have revealed to us, the great reservoir of potential strength which the Congress movement has for so long a time left untapped.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The true policy of the Congress movement should have been from the beginning to gather together under its flag all the elements of strength that exist in this huge country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The Brahmin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="81" href="#">1</a> Pandit and the Mahomedan Maulavi, the caste organisation and the trade-union, the labourer and the artisan, the coolie at his work and the peasant in his field, none of these should have been left out of the sphere of our activities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>For each is a strength, a unit of force; and in politics the victory is to the side which can marshal the largest and most closely serried number of such units and handle them most skilfully, not to those who can bring forward the best arguments or talk the most eloquently.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 347"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But the Congress started from the beginning with a misconception of the most elementary facts of politics and with its eyes turned towards the British Government and away from the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>To flaunt its moderation and reasonableness before approving English eyes, to avoid giving offence to British sentiments, to do nothing that would provoke a real conflict, this was its chief preoccupation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It concerned itself with such things as Simultaneous Examinations, Exchange Compensation, with the details of administration and the intricacies of finance: it presumed to give the Government advice on its military policy, and it passed omnibus resolutions covering the whole field of Indian affairs.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It has found it in the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But the awakening of this strength immediately brought the whole movement into collision with British interests, and the true nature of the Englishman, when his interests are threatened, revealed itself.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The <i>Times</i> on Congress 
Reforms</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 400"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The pronouncement of the <i>Times</i> on the proposal of the Congress for a further reform and expansion of the Indian Councils is significant for the thoroughness with which the futility and impossibility of the entire Congress ideal is exposed by the writer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gokhale took great pains last year in his address as President of the Congress to point out, in detail, how the present Council of the Indian Viceroy might be remodelled, without disturbing the present position of the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>His idea is that the elected members of the Viceregal Council may well be increased from five to twelve, of whom two shall be elected by the Chamber of Commerce and the representative of some important industry, and ten by the different Provinces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The two representatives of commerce and industry will, Mr. Gokhale opined, be Europeans, as there shall be 10 Indian members elected to the Council, out of 25, the total strength of that body; and even if they voted together they would be in a permanent and absolute minority; and the only effect of any vote they might give against the Government would be a moral effect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>This is Mr. Gokhale’s position and programme; and neither the <i>Times</i> nor, we are afraid, anybody else outside the ranks of those who hold that everything that is unreal and moderate is the product of sound statesmanship, clearly sees what the gain either to the people or to the Government will be from the acceptance of this wise and cautious counsel.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The ten Indian members will form HM’s permanent Opposition in India: that is all; but a permanent Opposition has all the evils of irresponsible criticism without the advantages of a real Opposition which can some day hope to be the Government, and whom this possibility </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 138</p>
<p class="PE"> always makes sober and responsible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>“The policy proposed by the Congress,” says the <i>Times</i>, “is a policy for bringing the Government into disrepute without the safeguards which all popular constitutions provide; it is a policy for generating steam without the precaution of supplying safety-valves;” and the justice of this criticism cannot be honestly denied.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 401"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>If Mr. Gokhale’s programme does not guarantee any benefit to the Government, neither is it likely to confer any benefit on the people except, of course, on a handful of men who shall enjoy the luxury of being Hon’bles and get enlarged opportunities of recommending their friends, relatives and proteges for office under the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The people will take little interest in these Council-elections, because they will soon find out – as they have already done in Bengal – that the elected members cannot carry any popular measure successfully through the Council or oppose effectively even the most mischievous ones.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gokhale is not only anxious to keep the elected members perpetually in the minority, but though he wants them to be vested with the right of moving amendments on the Budget, the Viceroy must have the right of vetoing them even if they are carried.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The fact is, there is absolutely no seriousness about the whole thing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is all to be a mere child’s play.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Or, Mr. Gokhale thinks, perhaps, that by gradually securing these so-called rights, he will ultimately get real constitutional rights and privileges from his British masters, but he forgets that these masters have never in the past done anything that has directly affected their interests and status as a sovereign power, nor will they do any such thing in the future, unless, of course, they are compelled to do it, by apprehensions of some great loss or danger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>As for the idea that this so-called reform in the Legislative Council will, in any way, make for popular freedom by educating the people, that also is evidently without any reasonable justification for its success; for, as the <i>Times</i> very justly points out, Mr. Gokhale’s programme has no room for any real political education for the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>To quote it in full: –<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 402"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>“Nor is the policy one which offers any substantial advantage to the people of India; it gives them increased opportunities </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 139</p>
<p class="PE"> of criticism but no increase of responsibility; it does nothing to give the people that education in politics which is essential if . . . they are now for the first time to have some share in the management of their own affairs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>By the scheme under consideration the leaders of Indian opinion would not acquire that sense of responsibility which necessarily comes to men who expect that they will shortly be in power themselves; they are to have opportunities for finding fault with the Government but they will never have to make their words good; they can with a light heart demand a reduction of taxation or denounce the Government for not putting a stop to famines, because they know that they can never themselves be called upon to prove that these reforms are practicable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It is the prospect of office which sobers and restrains a European Opposition!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Is it wise to assume that Indian politicians will be moderate and without this restraint?”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 403"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>And the justice of this criticism who will deny?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gokhale’s programme if accepted by Government, can have only one effect on the growth of public opinion and political life in India: it will prove the utter futility of any half-measures like these to secure real and substantial rights for the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Such an education through failure, was needed twenty-five years ago, when people still had faith in British shibboleths or had confidence in British character and British policy; it is absolutely needless and involves sheer waste of time and energy that have much greater calls on them for more substantial and urgent work now,– today when the people have already commenced to realise that their future must be shaped by themselves, without any help from their British masters, and indeed in spite of the most violent opposition that will, naturally, be offered by them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gokhale’s creed and his policy are anachronisms in the India of 1906; the one stands absolutely discredited with the people, the other is declared unwise and impracticable by the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The Congress must give these up, or continue as an effete anachronism in the country, or possibly<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="97" href="#">1</a> turn by the logic of this creed and this policy, into a loyalist opposition to all true and forceful popular movement and propaganda </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 140</p>
<p class="PE"> in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Can we afford to allow an institution that we have all served so faithfully all these years, and that may at once become an organised institution of popular deliberation and effective public life, to grow effete and useless?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Much less can we afford to place it in the hands of the enemies of popular freedom.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 417"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>It is impossible, we think, to condemn too strongly the attempt that is being made, by means of confidential circulars from Calcutta, to get up a fresh memorial to the Secretary of State for India, for the revocation or modification of the Partition of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We are strongly opposed, it is well known, to sending any fresh memorial on this subject, but this general objection apart, the methods that have been adopted to get up this new memorial are open to very serious objection, and it is to these that we desire to call public attention today.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>A telegraphic message was received in Comilla about the middle of last month from one of the Calcutta leaders asking the local leaders to send a delegate to a Conference that was proposed to be held on some urgent matters the following Sunday.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>What these urgent matters were was left to the imagination of the addressees to discover for themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Comilla strongly objected to be worked upon in this mysterious, if not masterly way from Calcutta, and wired back asking for definite and detailed information.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>No wire, we understand, was received in reply, but about a week later, just a few hours before the time fixed for the Conference, a printed letter, marked confidential, was received by Babu Ananga Mohan Ghosh, from the <i>Bengalee</i> office, containing excerpts from certain letters secured from London, which suggested that a fresh memorial should be sent to the Secretary of State for India for a reconsideration of the Partition of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>One of these extracts said: – “What appeared <i>absolutely hopeless</i> four weeks ago appears <i>hopeful</i> now.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There are indications that the Cabinet are willing to reconsider the Partition Question on its merits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>There are indications that in due time the question, if properly urged, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 144</p>
<p class="PE"> will be reopened.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>I am not at liberty to speak about Conferences I had just before leaving London.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>All that I can tell you is to advise you to have an influential and representative meeting, say, early in September, to adopt a strong, well-reasoned memorial, suggesting alternative schemes of Partition based on racial and linguistic grounds, and to submit it to the Secretary of State through the Indian Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Bengal has worked splendidly during the last 11 months,– Bengal will have to work a little longer,– not hysterically, but rationally and strongly,– making it clear that she will not accept the present Partition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>I believe redress is at hand.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 418"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Later on the writer, after quoting Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s reply to Mr. O’Donnell, modified his previous advice regarding public meeting and said – “On second thought a simple memorial seems to be enough if influentially signed – a meeting is unnecessary.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 419"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This letter came from a high authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But it is clear on the face of it that that high authority was playing into the hands of the Liberals interested in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The enforced retirement of Sir B. Fuller was a distinct confession on the part of the Government of the failure of the policy which prompted the Partition scheme, and which subsequently came to be so closely associated with the late Lieutenant-Governor of East Bengal and Assam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>This failure is distinctly due to the resistful attitude that has been assumed by the people of late, and in view of the complications with which the Government is threatened by the present anti-Partition and boycott agitation in Bengal, the authorities in England, as well as in this country, are evidently anxious to get out of the unpleasant and risky position wherein their own perversity has placed them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>To do this honourably and without any loss of prestige, they want a plea for reopening the discussion of Mr. Morley’s settled fact, and a fresh memorial from Bengal would find them this plea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>This, it seems clear, is the meaning of the excerpts quoted by us above from the London letter, on the strength of which the Calcutta leaders want a fresh memorial to be got up.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>They might make the attempt, there is no reason why, if they are convinced that it is their duty </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 145</p>
<p class="PE"> to send a fresh memorial, they should not make this attempt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But what we object to is the secretiveness of the whole thing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Why have they tried to keep this new proposal from the public?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Why should they arrogate to themselves the right of deciding, in consultation with a handful of men, as to what should be done in this matter?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The Conference held in the Landholders’ Association should have been an open Conference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But even at this closed Conference, the general opinion, if the reports that have reached us be correct, was decidedly against sending any fresh petition or memorial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It is said that Babu Motilal Ghose and others were distinctly opposed to the idea; and the words petition and memorial had to be dropped under pressure of this general opinion, especially among the mofussil delegates; all that was conceded by the Conference was that some suggestions might be sent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>We do not know if the questions of the channel through which the suggestions were to be sent was raised at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But whatever was decided by the Conference we find that a secret attempt is being made to send not suggestions, but a live, real memorial again to the Secretary of State for India on the Partition question.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>We do not respect official secrets, when public interests demand it, but widely publish them, and there is no reason why we should respect non-official secrets when their publication is called for in the interests of the public good.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We, therefore, make no apology for publishing the following letter that has been addressed from the <i>Bengalee</i> Office, to the leaders of public opinion in the mofussil: –<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 424"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>At a Conference held in the Rooms of the Landholders’ Association on Sunday last, at which several delegates from the mofussil were present, it was resolved to submit a representation to the Secretary of State for reviewing the Partition of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It was agreed that the representation, if possible, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 146</p>
<p class="PE"> should be forwarded early in September.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The representation is being drawn up, and in the meantime I beg you will forward to the <i>Bengalee</i> Office as many signatures (including of course the signatures of the leading inhabitants in your District).<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The representation would ask for Bengal (old and new Province) being placed under a Governor and Council, or in the alternative, the Bengali-speaking population being placed under one and the same administration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>I beg you will consider the matter as very urgent.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 425"><!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Yours sincerely,<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 426"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is clear thus, that a secret memorial is being got up to be sent again to the Indian State Secretary; and as this memorial will clearly be sent in the name and on behalf of the public, the public have just cause for complaint that in regard to such a vital question of policy they should have been left so entirely in the dark.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>There was a time when the people in general took really little or no interest in public questions of this kind; and in those days the getting up of such memorials in consultation with a few lawyers in the different districts, might have been justified; because they were about the only persons who took any interest in these public and political questions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The present Swadeshi agitation has, however, changed all this.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We have called up the real nation out of its ancient slumber, and the masses have commenced to take a keen and possibly a more earnest interest in public questions than even the so-called educated classes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>They have joined our meetings in their thousands and their tens of thousands, and have taken, during the last twelve months, an intelligent interest in our movements.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>What right have we now to ignore them in such momentous matters as the submission of a fresh memorial to the Secretary of State, which may radically change the face of the whole agitation?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The tactics adopted by the Calcutta clique seem, therefore, to be absolutely vicious.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>They strike at the very root of those principles of Democracy upon which the national movement in India and especially in Bengal is professedly based.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Democracy must have its leaders, and the leaders must exercise the right of guiding and shaping the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 147</p>
<p class="PE"> opinions and activities of the Democracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>But to guide, to train, to shape and to control public opinion and public activities is one thing but to ignore or suppress the views and sentiments of the public is another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>It is the autocrat alone who does or attempts to do so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>And this pernicious autocratic tendency in the leaders of Bengal must at once be knocked relentlessly on the head, if the present movement is to realise the high promise that is in it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The old leaders in Calcutta and those who dance in the mofussil to their tune, must be made to understand this distinctly that they will not be permitted to speak and act in the name of the public without fully and frankly taking that public into their confidence in regard to all important public questions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>Signs are not, indeed, wanting that the people will not suffer the tyrannies of their own leaders more patiently than they are prepared to suffer those of their foreign masters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The Comilla Resolution on this very subject of sending a fresh memorial to Government is significant as we pointed out yesterday.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>A similar Resolution, published in our telegraphic columns last Wednesday, has been adopted at a gathering of 20,000 men at Chittagong, in spite of the attempt made by some people to refer the matter to the local leaders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>The question was asked whether a larger vote could be taken on this topic at any meeting of the local Association, and it was frankly answered in the negative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>There were many men at this gathering who had come from the villages, and they all seemed clearly flattered by the fact that they were given such an opportunity of expressing their views on so important a matter, and this sense of satisfaction is a distinct guarantee of their future interest in public questions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Henceforth they will not look on our movements with their old listlessness and indifference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Is this a small gain?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Are we to neglect such a result for small favours from the Government?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>What even if the Partition continues, if only we can arouse a real interest in the masses in our public and political agitations?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>If the masses once awake from their present torpor, they will be able to undo a thousand evil and obstructive measures like the Partition of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>True statesmanship would prefer this quickening of public life and public spirit in the people to the revocation, as a favour, of even the most obnoxious and <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> pernicious Government measure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>But autocracy whether in the Government or in the governed, has no eye for the people; and it is, therefore, the greatest enemy of human progress everywhere, and should be ruthlessly exposed and knocked on the head by those who care for the advancement of the people and for their civic salvation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Had the old leaders acted straightforwardly in the matter and shown overwhelmingly strong reasons for the step, the leaders of the new party, although opposed on principle to the submission of new prayers and entreaties, might not have refused to countenance a strong and dignified representation which did not sacrifice in any degree the policy of Swadeshi and Boycott.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Is Mendicancy Successful?</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 527"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>An apologia for the mendicant policy has recently appeared in the columns of the <i>Bengalee</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The heads of the defence practically reduce themselves to two or three arguments.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 528"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>1. The policy of petitioning was recommended by Raja Rammohan Roy, has been pursued consistently since then and has been eminently successful – at least whatever political gains have been ours in the last century, have been won by this policy.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 529"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>2. Supposing this contention to be lost, there remains another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Mere<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="112" href="#">1</a> petitioning is bad, but when the petition is backed by the will of the community, resolved to gain its object by every legitimate means, it is not mendicancy but an assertion of a natural right.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 530"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>3. Even if a petitioning policy be bad in principle, politics has nothing to do with principles, but must be governed by expediency, and not only general expediency, but the expediency of particular cases.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 531"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>4. Then there is the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The Dumaists petition, the Irish petition; why should not we?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 532"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We believe this is a fair summary of our contemporary’s contentions.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 533"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We are not concerned to deny the antiquity of the petitioning policy, nor its illustrious origin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Raja Rammohan Roy was a great man in the first rank of active genius and set flowing a stream of tendencies which have transformed our national life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But what was the only possible policy for him in his times and without a century of experience behind him, is neither the only policy nor the best policy for us at the present juncture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We join issue with our contemporary on his contention that whatever we </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 174</p>
<p class="PE"> have gained politically has been due to petitioning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It appears to us to show a shallow appreciation of political forces and an entire inability to understand the fundamental facts which underlie outward appearances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>When the sepoys had conquered India for the English, choice lay before the British, either to hold the country by force and repression, or to keep it as long as possible by purchasing the co-operation of a small class of the people who would be educated so entirely on Western lines as to lose their separate individuality and their sympathy with the mass of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>An essential part of this policy which became dominant owing to the strong personalities of Macaulay, Bentinck and others, was to yield certain minor rights to the small educated class, and concede the larger rights as slowly as possible and only in answer to growing pressure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>This policy was not undertaken as the result of our petitions or our wishes, but deliberately and on strong grounds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>India was a huge country with a huge people strange and unknown to their rulers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>To hold it for ever was then considered by most statesmen a chimerical idea; even to govern it and keep it tranquil for a time was not feasible without the sympathy and co-operation of the people themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It was therefore the potential strength of the people and not the wishes of a few educated men, which was the true determining cause of the scanty political gains we so much delight in.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Since then the spirit of the British people and their statesmen has entirely changed,– so changed that even a Radical statesman like Mr. Morley brushes aside the expressed “will of the community” with a few abrupt and cavalier phrases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Why is this?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Precisely because we have been foolish enough to follow a purely mendicant policy and to betray our own weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If we had not instituted the National Congress we might have continued in the old way for some time longer, getting small and mutilated privileges whenever a strong Liberal Viceroy happened to come over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But the singularly ineffective policy and inert nature of the Congress revealed to British statesmen – or so they thought,– the imbecility and impotence of our nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>A period of repression, ever increasing in its insolence and cynical contempt for our feelings, has been the result.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>And now that <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> a Liberal Government of unprecedented strength comes into power, we find that the gains we can expect will be of the most unsubstantial and illusory kind and that we are not to get any guarantee against their being withdrawn by another reactionary Viceroy after a few years.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It is perfectly clear therefore that the policy of mendicancy will no longer serve.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>After all, cries the <i> Bengalee</i>, we have only failed in the case of the Partition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>We have failed in everything of importance for these many years, measure after measure has been driven over our prostrate heads and the longed-for Liberal Government flouts us with a few grudging concessions in mere symptomatic cases of oppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The long black list of reactionary measures remains and will remain unrepealed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>We do not care to deny that in small matters petitioning may bring us a trivial concession here or a slight abatement of oppression there; even there we shall fail in nine cases and win in one.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But nothing important, nothing lasting, nothing affecting the vital questions which most closely concern us, can be hoped for from mere mendicancy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>To the contention of antiquity and success, therefore, our answer is that this antique policy has not succeeded in the long run, but utterly failed, and that the time has come for a stronger and more effective policy to take its place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>To the other contentions of the <i>Bengalee</i> we shall reply in their proper order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>This which is the true basis of the petitionary philosophy, has neither reason nor fact to support it.<!--/SENT--></p>

Warning</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 599"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> has been sadly uneasy and troubled ever since the appearance of the new party as a force in politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Probably, it feels its secure and comfortable position as a [......] and worshipped patron of the Indian people threatened by the emergence of an obdurate and unpatronisable element.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>And it is at a loss how to deal with this unexampled situation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Sometimes fatherly, sometimes magisterial, now menacing, now superiorly argumentative, now solemnly exhortatory, this father Prospero tries to conjure the unwelcome spirit back to the [............].<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Dissatisfied with the result, it has called in an <i>ojha</i> all the way from England.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The warning of the liberal M. P. which the <i>Statesman</i> introduces with a flourish of trumpets contains at least one salutary truth which our countrymen would do well to take to heart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>We are in the habit of attaching an absurdly exaggerated importance to Sir William Wedderburn and Sir Henry Cotton and the small group of so-called friends of India who figure so largely in the news sent over to this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>But in England these men do not figure largely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>There is not one of them who can command the house or even get by his eloquence a decent number of members to listen to him; there is not one who has any influence with the Liberal Ministry; there is not one who can get a hearing from the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Anyone who knows intimately the working of politics in England, will realise that such a group can get no substantial measure carried through the house.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>For practical purposes a single Bradlaugh would be worth the whole clan of them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The interest which the British press has recently been showing in India was not brought about by this insignificant clique, it is the Swadeshi, the boycott, the violent unrest in Bengal which </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 194</p>
<p class="PE"> have compelled the lordly Briton [...........................................] his [......].<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>There is only one process which can rouse him from his comfortable prosperous sleep and that is to prod him continually in the ribs, there is only one way to make him feed his cow as well as milk her and that is for the cow to kick over the pail and refuse to be milked.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Flattery may please the Briton and it always delights him to play the lordly and generous patron, but he will take good care never to purchase this pleasure by the sacrifice of any substantial interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>For he is above all things a practical man of business.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Tears and prayers do not move him, for he finds them [......] and contemptible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Abuse has not any lasting effect on him, for it wounds his self-respect without hurting his interests or awaking his fears.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But the strong determined man who can make himself permanently unpleasant and ever dangerous, awakes his respect and seems to him a force to be reckoned with; in any tussle of interests he will try to cajole and outwit him, he will try to intimidate, bully and coerce him but, failing, he will finally concede what is wanted, shake hands and make friends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>This is the simple psychology of the Briton which the Congress agitation has throughout ignored.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Our agitation has been a wonderful feminine mixture of flattery, abuse, tears and entreaties; it is only from that we are trying the effects of strength and determination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>For thirty years we have used the weapons of women; now, very late in the day, we are trying to use the weapons of men.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 600"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i>’s Liberal M. P. warns us against [............] change of trend.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>He [............] John Bull to us as a bull indeed, good-natured and magnanimous when unprovoked but chafing at any red rag of sedition and capable of showing a very nasty temper.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We do not think he is right when he attributes Mr. Morley’s refusal to unsettle the Partition to irritation at the methods employed in Bengal: for Mr. Morley himself gave quite a contrary reason; and though he did not probably reveal the more important reasons at the back of his mind, we do not suppose Mr. Morley would tell an unnecessary lie.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But in the rest of his analysis, he may not be far from the truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We cannot, however, draw the same lesson from the fact he alleges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>“England </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 195</p>
<p class="PE"> is angry at your contumacy,” cries the <i> Statesman</i>, “you, her once timid and obedient slaves; mend your ways then, before you are whipped; run and kiss the feet of Lord Minto.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>On the contrary, we say, persist without wavering in the course you have adopted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The generosity of John Bull when unprovoked is a passive generosity; it will give you ease if you [......] liberty; it will give you small privileges if you prefer these to the one great privilege of becoming a free nation; but it will expect in return the persistent drain of your wealth and manhood.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>On the other hand his chafing and nasty tempers are excellent signs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>They mean that, for the first time, he has come to think the Indian problem a serious thing which demands handling; and we can predict how he will try to handle it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The Government will set themselves against the new school and the new methods and try to repress them by coercion; they will harass the organs of the new party; they will strike at the new method wherever they raise their head too aggressively.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But on the other side they will make quiet advances to the old school of politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>They have already laid their hands on the Exhibition by the offer of a small bribe and, if the precedent unconstitutionally created by our leaders in Calcutta is condoned and repeated in future years, the Exhibition will be officialized.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>They will try also, by slower stages, to officialize the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>To most of our readers this may seem a startling and improbable prediction, but let them watch events and wait.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The Legislative Councils will be “reformed”; the Congress, if purged of its “extremist” elements, will be recognized as a loyal and legitimate body, its views often consulted and its minor prayers often granted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The higher prizes or the services and the law will be more often given to Indians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Every effort will be made to gild the chains.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>But the essentials of autocratic rule, absolute control over legislation, over the executive, over the finances, will in no way be relaxed except under dire necessity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>This is the traditional policy of Great Britain when faced with such a situation as now exists in India and it is the policy we may expect to see in play for the next few years if Mr. Morley remains at the India Office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>How far it will succeed, will depend on the growth of the forward party which <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> is determined to be satisfied with no concessions that will not give the people control over the essentials of Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Only when John Bull fails to cajole and coerce will he finally come to terms unless indeed the Gods drive him mad and then neither the method of prayers nor the method of passive resistance will avail with him.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But why talk of the people’s love for him?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The people cannot love a civilian who was made a Lieutenant-Governor because he had undertaken to support the partition of the Province.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>And the less the officialised <i>Patriot</i> talks of the people the better for all concerned.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Since the dawn of the Sarvadhicary ascendancy it </p>

<p class="PE"> has been the aim and ambition of the <i>Patriot</i> to please Anglo-Indian officialdom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The weekly was converted into a daily to satisfy the literary fecundity of a Secretary and the way in which the <i>Patriot</i> behaved when the Victoria Memorial site was being discussed was a novel departure from that fixity of principles which alone can make people attach any value to the opinions of a paper.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Both of them are sincere patriots, both have done what work lay in them for their people and for the land that bore them; both are men of indomitable perseverance and high ability; but there the resemblance ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>One of them worn and aged, bowed down with the burden of half a century’s toils and labours, comes to us as the man of the past, reminding us of a generation that is passing away, ideals that have lost their charm, methods that have been found to be futile, an energy and hope once buoyant and full of life but which now live on only in a wearied and decrepit old age phantomlike, still babbling exploded generalities and dead formulas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The other comes with his face to the morning, a giant of strength and courage bearing on his unbowed shoulders the mighty burden of our future.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>From Mr. Tilak we expect no great speech and no sensational pronouncement, his very presence is more powerful than the greatest declamations; for it is not as an orator he stands prominent in spite of his clear incisive utterances, nor as a writer in spite of the immense influence which as the editor of the <i> Kesari</i> he exercises on the political ideal of Maharashtra, but as the man who knows what has to be done and does it, knows what has to be organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="130" href="#">1</a> and organizes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="131" href="#">2</a> it, knows what has to be resisted and resists it.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 202</p>
<p class="PE"> preeminently the man who acts, and action is to be the note of our future political energies.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 657"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Mr. Dadabhai on the other hand is the man who remonstrates; all his life has been spent in one energetic and unceasing remonstrance through books, through public speeches, through letters and writings in public print.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Remonstrance, not action, was the note of our political energies in the past.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Action was, according to the old gospel, the prerogative of the Government whether in India or in Great Britain and our only duty was to urge them to act justly and not unjustly, in our interests and not in their own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We expected them to be angels and remonstrated with them when they proved to be merely men; this spur of that remonstrance, it was hoped, would prick them or at least the home-bred of Englishmen to justify the angelic hues in which they had painted themselves, for our benefit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>To the young generation these hopes nowadays seem so incredibly futile that they are tempted to wonder how men of ability and education, many of whom<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="132" href="#">3</a> had studied something at least of history, could ever have cherished them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But when Mr. Naoroji began his career nothing more real and solid was possible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The falling in pieces of the Maratha Confederacy and the overthrow of the Sikh power had left the Punjab and the Deccan stupefied and apathetic; the rest of India was politically exhausted and inert.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>In such circumstances it was inevitable that the task of reviving the life of the nation should fall into the hands of a small class of men educated in English schools and in English ways of thinking.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It was the one great service these men did to our country, that they accustomed us to hope once more and live politically.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It was our misfortune rather than their fault that the hopes they proclaimed were delusive and the life they imparted meagre and superficial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Destitute of political experience they could not avoid basing their political creed on theories and ideals rather than upon facts; without any education but what the rulers chose to impart they had no choice but to borrow their theories and ideas from their English teachers; confined to English books and influence, cut off from the wide wholesome atmosphere of the world’s culture they were obliged to accept Englishmen at their </p>

<p class="PE"> own valuation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>They were for the most part men of talent and ability; and it requires more than talent and ability; it needs the eye of genius to dispense with the necessity of experience and see truth with a single intuitive glance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 658"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The ideas on which our agitation in the nineteenth century proceeded were therefore fantastic and unfounded; its methods were unsuited to the realities of political life in this country, its spirit and aim were so purely Westernized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="133" href="#">4</a> as to preclude the possibility of seizing on the whole people and creating a new national life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The energy expended on it was therefore small, limited both in intensity and area; and the results it brought about were not even commensurate with the little energy expended.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But two things were gained – the renewal of political activity in the country and of political experience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>A renewed life might have been brought about in other ways and with greater power and reality; but for experience that long wandering in the desert of unrealities and futilities was probably indispensable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>However that may be, Mr. Naoroji was among the small knot of able men who first set in motion the new political activities of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>And one thing distinguished him above most of his fellows that while they wasted themselves on things petty and unreal, he seized on one great fact and enforced it in season and out of season on all who could be got to listen,– the terrible poverty of India and its rapid increase under British rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It was necessary that a persistent voice should din this into the ears of the people; for what with the incessant pratings about British peace, British justice and the blessings of British rule on the one side and the clamour for Legislative Councils, Simultaneous Examinations, High Education and similar shams on the other, this one central all-important reality was in danger of being smothered out of sight.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It was necessary for the nation but to realise its increasing poverty under British rule; only then could it take the next step and take to heart the fact that British rule and increasing poverty stood in the relation of cause and effect; last of all comes the inevitable conclusion that the effect could only be cured by the removal of the cause, in other words by the substitution of autonomy in place of a British or British-controlled </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Mr. Naoroji’s was the persistent voice that compelled the nation to realise the first two of these fundamental truths; Mr. Romesh Dutt and others powerfully assisted the result, but it was Mr. Naoroji who first forced the question of Indian poverty into prominence, and for this India owes him a debt of gratitude deeper than that due to any other of our older politicians dead or living.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It is true that he has not been able to proclaim the third of the three connected truths consistently and frankly; especially have those of his utterances which were meant for purely Indian consumption, been marred by the desire to qualify, moderate and even conceal a plain fact, which though it was necessary, it might yet be dangerous to proclaim.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless it is something that a man of his age and traditions should at least have frankly declared that freedom from foreign rule must needs be the only governing ideal of Indian politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The man who is responsible for that declaration ought to be no Moderate.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 662"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The great Calcutta Congress, the centre of so many hopes and fears, is over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Of the various antagonistic or contending forces which are now being hurled together into that Medea’s cauldron of confused and ever fiercer struggle out of which a free and regenerated India is to arise, each one had its own acute fears and fervent hopes for the results of this year’s Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Anglo-India and Tory England feared that the Extremists might capture the assembly; they hoped that a split would be created, and, as a result, the Congress either come to an end and land itself in the limbo of forgotten and abortive things or else, by the expulsion of the new life and the new spirit from its midst, sink into the condition of a dead-alive ineffectual body associated with the Government and opposing it now and then only for form’s sake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Liberal England represented by the Cottons and Wedderburns hoped that the unsustaining and empty concessions Mr. Morley is dangling before the eyes of the Moderate leaders might bring back the Congress entirely into its old paths and the new spirit be killed by the show of kindness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It feared that the National Assembly might see through the deception and publicly demand that there should be either substantial concessions or none at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>In India itself the Moderates feared that the forward party in Bengal might force through the Congress strong resolutions on Boycott and other alarming matters or else avenge their failure by wrecking the Congress itself, but they hoped that by an imposing show of ex-Presidents on the platform, by the reverence due to the age and services of Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji, by the dominant personality of the lion of the Bombay Corporation, by the strong contingents from Bombay city, Gujerat and other </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 206</p>
<p class="PE"> provinces still unswept by new brooms, by the use of tactics and straining in their favour all the advantages of an indefinite and nebulous constitution, they would quell the Extremists, prevent the bringing forward of the Boycott and keep absolute control of the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The forward party hoped to leave the impress of the new thought and life on the Congress of 1906, to get entire self-government recognised as the ideal of the Congress and Swadeshi and Boycott as the means, and to obtain a public recognition of the new ideas in the Presidential address, but they feared that the realisation of such considerable results would be too much to hope for in a single year and a fierce and prolonged struggle would be needed to overcome the combined forces of conservatism, timidity, self-distrust and self-interest, which have amalgamated into the loyalist Moderate party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Such was the state of mind of the conflicting parties when the Calcutta Congress was opened on the 26th.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 663"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Today on the 30th, we can look back and count our gains and losses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The hopes of Anglo-India have been utterly falsified and the Anglo-Indian journals cannot conceal their rage and disappointment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The loudest in fury is our dear old perfervid <i>Englishman</i> which cries out in hollow tones of menace that if the Congress tolerates Boycott, the Congress itself will not be tolerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The hopes and fears of Liberal England have been only partially fulfilled and partially falsified; the Congress has definitely demanded colonial self-government and it has accepted the offered concessions of Mr. Morley only as steps towards that irreducible demand; the new spirit, instead of being killed by kindness, has declared in no uncertain voice its determination to live.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The fears of the Moderates have been falsified; no strongly worded resolutions have been passed: neither has the Congress been wrecked by the rapid development of contending parties in our midst.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Their hopes too have been falsified.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Nothing was more remarkable in the present Congress than its anti-autocratic temper and the fiery energy with which it repudiated any attempt to be dictated to by the authority of recognised leaders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Charges of want of reverence and of rowdyism have been freely brought against this year’s Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>To the first charge we answer that </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 207</p>
<p class="PE"> the reverence has been transferred from persons to the ideal of the motherland; it is no longer Pherozshah Mehta or even Mr. Dadabhai Naoroji who can impose silence and acquiescence on the delegates of the nation by their presence and authority, for the delegates feel that they owe a deeper reverence and a higher duty to their country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Henceforth the leaders can only deserve reverence by acting in the spirit of the chief servants of their country and not in the spirit of masters and dictators.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>This change is one of the most genuine signs of political progress which we have observed in our midst.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The charge of rowdyism merely means that the Congress, instead of a dead unanimity and mechanical cheers, has this time shown lively signs of real interest and real feeling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is ridiculous to contend that in a national assembly the members should confine themselves to signs of approval only and conceal their disapproval; in no public assembly in the world, having a political nature, is any such rule observed; and the mother of Parliaments itself is in the habit of expressing its disapproval with far greater vehemence than was done in this year’s Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It was due to this growth of deep feeling and of the spirit of independence that the spells on which the Moderate leaders had depended, failed of their power to charm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The lion of the Bombay Corporation found that a mightier lion than himself had been aroused in Bengal,– the people.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 664"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>For ourselves, what have we to reckon as lost or gained?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>No strongly worded resolutions have been pressed and we are glad that none have been passed, for we believe in strong action and not in strong words.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But our hopes have been realised, our contentions recognised if not always precisely in the form we desired or with as much clearness and precision as we ourselves would have used, yet definitely enough for all practical purposes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Congress has declared self-government on colonial lines to be its demand from the British Government and this is only a somewhat meaningless paraphrase of autonomy or complete self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The Congress has recognised the legitimacy of the Boycott movement as practical in Bengal without limitation or reservation and in such terms that any other province which </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 208</p>
<p class="PE"> feels itself called upon to resort to this weapon in order to vindicate its rights, need not hesitate to take it up.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The Congress has recognised the Swadeshi movement in its entirety including the adoption of a system of self-protection by the people; within the scope of its resolution it has found room for the idea of self-help, the principle of self-sacrifice and the policy of the gradual exclusion of foreign goods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The Congress has recognised the necessity of National Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The Congress has recognised the necessity of a Constitution and adopted one as a tentative measure for a year, which, crude, meagre and imperfect as it is, depends only on our own efforts to develop by degrees into a working constitution worthy of a national assembly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>All that the forward party has fought for, has in substance been conceded, except only the practice of recommending certain measures which depend on the Government for their realisation; but this was not a reform on which we laid any stress for this particular session.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We were prepared to give the old weakness of the Congress plenty of time to die out if we could get realities recognised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Only in one particular have we been disappointed and that is the President’s address.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But even here the closing address with which Mr. Naoroji dissolved the Congress, has made amends for the deficiencies of his opening speech.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>He once more declared self-government, Swaraj, as in an inspired moment he termed it, to be our one ideal and called upon the young men to achieve it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The work of the older men had been done in preparing a generation which were determined to have this great ideal and nothing less; the work of making the ideal a reality, lies with us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We accept Mr. Naoroji’s call and to carry out his last injunctions will devote our lives and, if necessary, sacrifice them.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Comilla Incident</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 693"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The Comilla affair remains, after everybody has said his say, obscured by the usual tangle of contradictions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Hindu version presents a number of allegations,– specific, detailed and categorical,– of attacks on Hindus, making up in the mass a serious picture of a mofussil town given over for days to an outbreak of brutal lawlessness on the part of one section of the Mahomedan community, a Magistrate quiescent and sympathetically tolerant of the rioters, and the final resort by the Hindu community to drastic measures of self-defence on the continued refusal of British authority to do its duty as the guardian of law and order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>A Mahomedan report belittled the accounts of Mahomedan violence and presented picturesque and vivid details of Hindu aggressiveness; but as this version has since been repudiated, we have to turn to the official account for the other side of the picture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But the official account – well, the value of official statements is an understood thing all the world over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Is it not a political byword in England itself that no rumour or irresponsible statement should be believed until it had been officially denied?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The official version of the Comilla incident published on the 9th March is hard to beat as a specimen of its class – it is a most amazingly unskilful production over which suppression of truth and suggestion of falsehood are written large and palpable; but it presents a beautiful and artistic picture of wanton and murderous Hindu violence, comparative Mahomedan moderation, and fatherly British care brooding dove-eyed and maternal-winged over its irreconcilably quarrelsome step-children.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 694"><!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>If anyone should think our characterisation of this historical </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 214</p>
<p class="PE"> document too sweeping, we invite him to a careful study both of what it says and what it does not say.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It commences with the statement that “a series of anti-Partition meetings were recently held here <i>without incident</i> and on 6th March Nawab Salimullah arrived from Dacca to hold counter-meetings.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The insertion of the words “without incident” is admirable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It implies that there was violent irritation between Hindus and Mahomedans on the Partition question and the latter might have been expected to show their irritation by “incidents”,– especially when the “inflammatory” speeches of Babu Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="137" href="#">1</a> Chandra Pal and other firebrands are taken into account,– but they very considerately refrained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Thus Mahomedan moderation is contrasted with the Hindu aggressiveness which is presently to be related, and the way paved for throwing the whole responsibility on the anti-Partition agitation and aggressive Swadeshism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Then we are informed as a positive fact that a brick was thrown at the Nawab’s procession and brooms held up in derision.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>“This led to some disturbance and a cloth shop was <i>entered</i> but not looted and two prostitutes’ houses robbed.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Let us pause over this delightful sentence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The outrageous assaults by the rioters which the Hindu accounts carefully specify, are all hidden away and glossed over under the mild and gentlemanly phrase “some disturbance”; the only specific instances which the Commissioner will acknowledge are the cloth-shop “incident” and the “incident” of the two prostitutes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But after all, what occurred in the cloth-shop?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It was merely “entered”,– admirable word! – the rioters were far too polite, honourable and considerate to loot it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>They simply entered for the sheer joy of entering and perhaps of gazing ecstatically on bales of Swadeshi cloth!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>They also “entered” the houses of two prostitutes, but in this instance indemnified themselves for their trouble; still, the people robbed were merely prostitutes!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It is thus suggested that the disturbance was of the most trifling character and the only sufferers a shopkeeper and two prostitutes; in fact, the whole thing was little more than an amiable frolic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Of the violent maltreatment not only of students and shopkeepers but of pleaders and other respectable citizens, of the forcible invasion of private houses <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> and the attempts to break into or, let us say, “enter” women’s apartments, there is not a word.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 695"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>After this day of “entries” there is a blank in the official record until the next evening when “the Nawab’s Secretary, a Parsi, was attacked <i>while walking alone</i> and severely beaten with lathis by some Hindus.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The provocation alleged to have been given by Mr. Cursetji is carefully omitted, and we are asked to believe that an inoffensive Parsi gentleman out for an innocent and healthful evening walk was waylaid, when alone, and severely beaten because he happened to be the Nawab’s Private Secretary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>And the evening and the morning were the second day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>On the third all was again quiet till that dangerous time, the evening, when an “unlicensed Mahomedan procession”, greatly daring, took the air like Mr. Cursetji before them, apparently with the innocuous object of relieving their feelings and exercising their lungs shouting Allah-ho-Akbar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This explains a great deal; evidently the bands of hooligans ranging the streets and attacking people and “entering” houses were in reality “no such matter” except in vivid Hindu imaginations; they were merely “unlicensed Mahomedan processions” on innocent shouting intent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Some unknown person, however, fired upon this procession and killed a Mahomedan baker; and there, inexplicably enough, matters ended for the day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The shot, however, had a powerful effect upon the authorities; it seems to have stirred them up to some faint remembrance of the elementary duties of a civilised administration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Accordingly our martial Commissioner telegraphed, like Kuropatkin, for “reinforcements”, and pending their arrival sent for the Mahomedan Sardars and Mullahs and “enlisted” their influence to keep the peace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>In the name of reason and logic, why?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The account shows that all the violence and lawlessness, if we except the trifling affairs of the unlooted shop and the looted prostitutes, proceeded from the Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The Mahomedans, it seems, kept perfectly quiet until the night of this third day, when the only incidents were again of a trifling character; a man riding on the step of a carriage was “struck”; a Hindu peon was “struck”, nothing more.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We are ourselves “struck” by the mildness of the methods employed by these </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 216</p>
<p class="PE"> rioters; they do not break into houses, they merely “enter” them; they do not severely beat anyone as Mr. Cursetji was “severely beaten” by the Hindus; they merely “strike” a man or two in playful sort.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Under the circumstances it is surely the leaders of the Hindu community who should have been enlisted “to keep the peace” – say, as special constables.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>However, in the end, the reinforcements arrived and the Commissioner busied himself in the fatherly British way, “inquiring personally into all allegations and endeavouring to bring the leaders of both parties together”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>On this touching scene the official curtain falls.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Who shall say after this that “divide and rule” is the policy of the British bureaucracy in India?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 696"><!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We have said enough to expose thoroughly this ridiculous account of a very serious affair.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It is the production not of an impartial official keeping the peace between two communities, but of a partisan in a political fight who looks upon the anti-Swadeshi Mahomedans as allies “enlisted” on the side of the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>In order to understand the affair we have to read into the official account all that it carefully omits; and for this we must fall back on the Hindu version of the incident.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>What seems to have happened, is clear enough in outline, whatever doubt there may be as to details.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The popular cause was making immense strides in Comilla and the magnificent success of the District Conference had afforded a proof which could not be ignored.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The redoubtable Nawab Salimullah of Dacca considered it his duty to his patron, the Assam Government, to stem the tide of nationalism in Tipperah.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Accordingly he marched Comillawards with his lieutenants and entered the town in conquering pomp.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>That he ordered the sack of the conquered city, is probably no more than the suspicion natural to excited imaginations; but it is certain that his coming was immediately responsible for the riots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>His whole history since he was shoved into prominence by his Anglo-Indian patrons, has been one long campaign against the Hindus with attempts to excite the passions and class selfishness of the Mahomedans and inflame them into permanent hostility to their Hindu fellow-countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>It is only within the territorial limits of the Nawab’s </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 217</p>
<p class="PE"> influence that there has been any serious friction between Hindus and Mahomedans on the Swadeshi and Partition questions; but so far as it has gone, its immediate results have been not only friction but outbreaks of violence and lawlessness either in small<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="138" href="#">2</a> as at Serajgunge or on a large scale as in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="139" href="#">3</a> Mymensingh.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>It is not therefore surprising that while the Conference at Comilla and the recent Swadeshi meetings came off without “incident”, the Nawab should no sooner have set his foot in Comilla than a reign of violence and lawlessness began.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>At the same time it is probable that the suddenness of the outbreak was due to some immediate exciting cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The brick story bears a suspicious resemblance to the incident which set Sir Bampfylde and his Gurkhas rioting officially at Barisal; but it is likely enough that a few individuals may have shown their feelings towards the Nawab in an offensive way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>However that may be, it seems certain that the more rowdy elements of the Mahomedan population broke into lawless riot, attacked Hindus wherever they found them, broke into shops and private houses and brutally assaulted students, pleaders and other respectable Hindus, attempting even in some cases to enter the women’s apartments.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 697"><!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Once begun, the affair followed familiar lines.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>As in Mymensingh, it commenced with an orgy of lawlessness on the part of ignorant low-class Mahomedans inflamed by the Nawab’s anti-Hindu campaign.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>As in Mymensingh, local authorities would not at first interfere, although appealed to by Hindu gentlemen, and confined themselves to academic arguments as to the genesis of the outrages.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>As in Mymensingh, the Hindus, taken by surprise and denied the protection of the law, fell first into a panic and only afterwards rallied and began to organise self-defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>At Comilla, however, they seemed to have acted with greater promptitude and energy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>The disturbances continued for three days at least; but by that time the Hindus had picked themselves together, the women were removed to a safe place where they could be guarded by bands of volunteers and the whole community stood on the defensive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>Two or three collisions seem to have taken place, in one of which, possibly, Mr. Cursetji was roughly handled, in another a Mahomedan shot dead.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>By this time the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 218</p>
<p class="PE"> Commissioner had realised that the policy of non-interference adopted by the British authorities, was leading to serious results which they cannot have anticipated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The military police were telegraphed for and other measures taken which came at least three days too late, since the mischief had been thoroughly done.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 698"><!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>Divested of exaggeration and rumour, we fancy the actual facts will be found to amount to something like the above.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>We do not for a moment believe that the Hindus took aggressive action without serious and even unbearable provocation, any more than we believe that the riot was planned or ordered beforehand by the anti-Swadeshi section of the Mahomedans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>We trust that the usual mistake of instituting cases and countercases will be avoided.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>If the Comilla nationalists wish the facts of the case to be known let them draw up a statement of their version with the evidence of the persons assaulted for the enlightenment of public opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>The time ought to be now past, in Eastern Bengal at least, when appeal to the British courts could be either a remedy or a solace.<!--/SENT--></p>

Self-Protection</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 702"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>There are two superstitions which have driven such deep root into the mind of our people that even where the new spirit is strongest, they still hold their own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>One is the habit of appealing to British courts of justice; the other is the reliance upon the British executive for our protection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The frequent recurrence of incidents such as the Mymensingh and Comilla disturbances will have its use if it drives into our minds the truth that in the struggle we have begun we cannot and ought not to expect protection from our natural adversaries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is perfectly true that one of the main preoccupations of the executive mind has been the maintenance of order and quiet in the country, because a certain kind of tranquillity was essential to the preservation of an alien bureaucratic control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>This was the secret of the barbarous system of punishments which make the Indian Penal Code a triumph of civilised savagery; of the licence<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="140" href="#">1</a> and the blind support allowed by the Magistracy to a phenomenally corrupt and oppressive Police; of the doctrine of no conviction no promotion, which is the gospel of the Anglo-Indian executive, holding it better that a hundred innocent should suffer than one crime be recorded as unpunished.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This was the reason of the severity with which turbulent offences have always been repressed, of the iniquitous and oppressive system of punitive Police and of the undeclared but well-understood Police rule that any villager of strong physique, skill with weapons and active habits should be entered in the list of bad characters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>By a rigid application of these principles the bureaucracy have succeeded in creating the kind of tranquillity they require.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The Romans created a desert and called the result peace; the British in India have destroyed the spirit and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 220</p>
<p class="PE"> manhood of the people and call the result law and order.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is true, on the other hand, that there have been exceptions to the promptness and severity with which turbulence of any kind is usually dealt with; and the most notable is the supineness and dilatoriness, habitually shown by the authorities, in dealing with outbreaks of Mahomedan fanaticism and the gingerly fashion in which repression in such cases is enforced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Fear is undoubtedly at the root of this weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy are never tired of impressing the irresistible might of British supremacy on the subject populations; but in their own hearts they are aware that that supremacy is insecure and without root in the soil; the general upheaval of any deep-seated and elemental passion in the hearts of the people might easily shatter that supremacy as so many others have been shattered before it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The one passion which in past times has been proved capable of so upheaving the national consciousness in India is religious feeling; and outraged religious feeling is therefore the one thing which the bureaucracy dreads and the slightest sign of which turns their courage into nervousness or panic and their strength into paralysed weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The alarm which the Swadeshi movement created was due to this abiding terror; for in the Swadeshi movement for the first time patriotism became a national religion, the name of the motherland was invested with divine sacredness and her service espoused with religious fervour and enthusiasm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>In its alarm Anglo-India turned for help to that turbulent Mahomedan fanaticism which they had so dreaded; hoping to drive out poison by poison, they menaced the insurgent religion of patriotism with the arming of Mahomedan prejudices against what its enemies declared to be an essentially Hindu movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The first fruits of this policy we have seen at Mymensingh, Serajgunge and Comilla.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It was a desperate and dangerous and might easily prove a fatal expedient; but with panic-stricken men the fear of the lesser danger is easily swallowed in the terror of the greater.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 703"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It should not therefore be difficult to see that the demand for official protection in such affairs as the Comilla riots is as unpractical as it is illogical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The object of modern civilised Governments in preserving tranquillity is to protect the citizen not </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 221</p>
<p class="PE"> only in the peaceful pursuit of his legitimate occupations but in the public activities and ambitions natural to a free people; the Government exists for the citizen, not the citizen for the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But the bureaucracy in India is only half-modern and semi-civilised.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In India the individual,– for there is no citizen,– exists for the Government; and the object in preserving tranquillity is not the protection of the citizen but the security of the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The security of the individual, such as it is, is only a result and not an object.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But the security of the Government, if by Government we understand the present irresponsible bureaucratic control, is directly threatened by the Swadeshi movement; for the declared object of that movement is Swaraj, which means the entire elimination of that control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>To ask the bureaucracy, therefore, to protect us in our struggle for Swaraj is to ask it to assist in its own destruction.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 704"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This plain truth is obviously recognised by the officials of the Shillong Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The attitude taken up by the Magistrates of Mymensingh and Comilla, was identically the same; they saw no necessity for interfering; the Hindus by their Swadeshi agitation had brought the Mahomedan storm upon themselves and must take the consequences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The unexpressed inference is plain enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The bureaucratic “constitution”, under which we are asked to carry on “constitutional” Government, assures us British peace and security only so long as we are not Swadeshi.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The moment we become Swadeshi, British peace and security, so far as we are concerned, automatically come to an end, and we are liable to have our heads broken, our men assaulted, our women insulted and our property plundered without there being any call for British authority to interfere.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Berhampur Conference</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 709"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The Conference which meets at Berhampur tomorrow is the most important that has been yet held in Bengal, for its deliberations are fraught with issues of supreme importance to the future of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>A heavy responsibility rests upon the delegates who have been sent to Berhampur from all parts of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>For this is the first Provincial Conference after the historic twenty-second session of the Congress at Calcutta.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>At that session the policy of self-development and self-help was incorporated as an integral part of the political programme by the representatives of the whole nation, the policy of passive resistance was declared legitimate under circumstances which cover the whole of India, and it was decided that a constitution or working organisation should be created for the promotion throughout the year of the programme fixed by the Congress for the whole nation and by the Provinces for themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It rests upon the Berhampur Conference to see that proper provision is made for this executive work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We expect the delegates to realise the seriousness of the task that has been put in their hands and to appoint a Provincial Council which will command the confidence of the whole of Bengal and prove by its very composition that an earnest attempt will be made to harmonise all parties in working out so much of the national programme as has been assented to by all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Swadeshi, Boycott, National Education,– these are the three planks upon which all can take their stand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We do not disguise from ourselves the fact that on the last two of these questions there are very serious differences of opinion between the two schools now dividing public opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In the matter of Boycott, the difference has been one of greater or less thoroughness in </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 225</p>
<p class="PE"> practice and of the ultimate goal; but the necessity of Boycott has been recognised by all and there is no reason why any section should refuse to take part in the measures by which it can be made effective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>National Education is regarded by one school as an educational experiment to be carried on side by side with Government education,– by the other as a great national cause, the progress of which is to culminate in a truly national system replacing or absorbing the Government schools and colleges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, the spread of the movement has been recognised as desirable by all and there is therefore no reason why measures with that view should not be concerted with general approval.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We trust therefore that the delegates at Berhampur will give a mandate to the newly-formed council to organise Swadeshi and Boycott in a practical manner and devise means by which they can be rendered stringent and effective and to see that national schools be established in every district and national support be given to the Council of Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>If they fail to do this, they will have done considerably less than their duty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 710"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But the duty of the delegates does not begin and end with arranging for the execution of the national programme as laid down by the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Congress deals only with accomplished facts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It set its seal of sanction on National Education and Swadeshi and legitimised the Boycott for all India in recognition of work which had already been commenced in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But there are other fields in which self-development and self-help are urgently necessary; and it remains for each province to initiate action in each of them successively according to its own circumstances and under the pressure of its own needs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Both the policy of self-help and the Boycott policy have taken shape as a national policy in Bengal as a result of the exceptional trend of events in our province.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>They are now travelling all over India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Swadeshi has been universally recognised, Boycott is a fact in Maharashtra as well as in Bengal and is now being publicly advocated in the North and in Madras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But Bengal cannot pause till the rest of India comes up with her,– she must still lead the way even if it be many miles in front.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The very initiative she has taken will inevitably sweep her on, whether she wills it or not; </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 226</p>
<p class="PE"> for that exceptional trend of events which has carried her along, is nothing but the impulsion of a Divine Hand which is shaping through her the way of salvation for all India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>That impulsion is not likely to cease; it is already pointing us to fresh departures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Since the Congress met, three new necessities have presented themselves for Bengal,– the necessity of National Arbitration Courts, the necessity of organised self-protection and the necessity of prevention of famine by self-help.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The second of these is the one which we should, in our opinion, take immediately in hand; for it is likely to be urgently needed in the near future and in its absence the national movement will remain deficient in the first element of strength and its defencelessness will perpetually invite attack.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>If we are to proceed with the work of the nation in peace, we must immediately turn our attention to organising self-protection all over Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The immediate need of the prevention of famine may be met by the suspension of grain-export of which the <i>Bangabasi</i> has made itself the champion; but this policy will have to be supplemented and regulated by permanent measures of a far-reaching kind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>At present a Resolution approving of export suspension as a temporary measure urgently needed, ought to be sufficient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We do not suppose we need apprehend much difference of opinion on this head.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The anti-national superstition of free trade ought to have perished out of Bengal by this time; for a subject nation self-preservation must be the first and dominating principle of its political economy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Neither should there be any opposition to the proposal for Arbitration Courts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Arbitration as a means of diminishing the curse of litigation has been advocated by the Congress and the only difference now is that instead of asking for it from an alien Government which fattens upon the very litigation that impoverishes us, we resolve to establish it for ourselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We fear, however, that there may be serious difficulty in getting the all-important proposal of self-protection accepted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The attitude of the Moderate leaders in the Comilla matter was of evil omen.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 711"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We hope nevertheless that the delegates of the new school will strain every nerve to get these necessary items added to the working programme for the year.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>By choosing a place where the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 227</p>
<p class="PE"> new spirit has not made headway and by fixing a date which will make it difficult for the East Bengal delegates to arrive in time, the managers of the Conference will probably have secured a large Moderate majority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>We are not sorry that this should be so; for it will give us an opportunity of observing how the advantage gained by this tactical trickery will be used.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The present Conference will decide whether the two parties can still hope to work together on the basis of the compromise arrived at in December, or whether, as in Japan, a determined fight for the possession of the national mind and guidance of national action is to precede the great work of emancipation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>We shall willingly accept either alternative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>If we can work together the work will be more rapid in the beginning and smoother; if, on the contrary, we have to settle our differences first, the work will be more energetic and more rapid in the end.<!--/SENT-->

Conference</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 715"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>When the Moderate caucus which arranges our Congresses and Conferences selected Srijut Deepnarain Singh to preside at Berhampur, they thought, no doubt, that they had hit upon a doubly suitable choice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>As a young man and one known to be an ardent patriot he would not disgust Bengal by an ultra-moderate pronouncement; as a Zamindar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="143" href="#">1</a> he might be expected to have the fear of the Government before his eyes and to avoid giving open support to the ideas and programme of the New School.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It was this latter apprehension, we believe, that lay at the root of the dissatisfaction expressed by some of ourselves at the choice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>For our part we shared neither the hopes of the Moderates nor the fears of our own party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We happen to know something of Srijut Deepnarain Singh by report when he was in England and we could not believe that so much fire, sincerity and ardour had been quenched in so short a time or even subdued by his position as a rich man and a Zamindar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="144" href="#">2</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We confidently expected from him a pronouncement worthy of the occasion and we have not been disappointed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The spirit of true nationalism underlies his address as reported in substance; the programme of the New School, so far as it has yet taken concrete shape either in practice or in immediate urgency, has been accepted and the declaration for Boycott is satisfactorily clear and unmistakable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>By bringing Srijut Deepnarain forward, it is probable that a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="145" href="#">3</a> real service will have been done to Bihar which is in bad need of men who can understand the drift of the times and direct the political activities of the province towards the future instead of trying to keep them clamped to a dead and rotting past.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Bihar has a future of its own as a Hindi-speaking sub-race of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 229</p>
<p class="PE"> our nationality; and in that United States of India, which the prophetic vision of the President has forecast, it will have its individual station.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But in order to carry weight in that Union Bihar must take up its destinies and become an active force in the general movement towards independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Whether the Biharis<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="146" href="#">4</a> are wise in desiring administrative separation from Bengal under the present bureaucracy, it is difficult to say.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>For our own part, we are inclined to doubt whether Bihar is as yet quite strong enough to stand by itself unassociated with Bengal or the United Provinces in resistance to a bureaucratic oppression; but if the Biharis<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="147" href="#">5</a> generally think themselves strong enough and desire to stand apart, we should be the last, professing the principles we do, to oppose the idea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Administrative arrangements have ceased to be of vital importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But the attempt which has been made in recent times to estrange the Biharis<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="148" href="#">6</a> from the Bengalis in spirit, is a more serious matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>There can be no ground of quarrel between the two peoples except such as arises from the unholy passion for Government service, places and favours; and this ignoble cause of dissension the new spirit will, we hope, destroy before long by making place and service a brand of dishonour rather than of distinction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Judging from Srijut Deepnarain’s address we seem to have in him a Bihari<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="149" href="#">7</a> of spirit, judgment and intellectual ability who has already grasped the future in anticipation and is likely to model the activities of his province in accordance with that larger vision and not under the stress of petty and evanescent interests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>No province can advance under a more unerring guide or shape its activities to the demands of a more infallible ideal than this vision of an India united in its variety.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Regional and communal individualities and activities cannot be blotted out from this vast country, but they can be harmonised into a dominating unity.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 716"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>For the rest, it is curious to note how invariably the manoeuvres of the Moderates turned against themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>This is indeed inevitable, for when Fate is against men, their likeliest measures and best-concerted combinations act to their own detriment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Dadabhai Naoroji was made President in order to dish the Extremists; yet it was this Moderate President who gave us the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 230</p>
<p class="PE"> cry of Swaraj which the Extremists have made their own and which is stirring the blood of the nation to great actions and great ideals.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Madras and the United Provinces were declared to be unanimous against Boycott in order to prevent the Boycott Resolution from passing through the Congress; but the only result has been to raise a storm of Extremism in South and North alike and set the cry of Boycott ringing from one end of India to the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The shamelessly arbitrary action of the Moderate caucus at Allahabad has done more to kill the old and help the new than the free admission of the Boycotters could possibly have done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The selection at the last moment of Srijut Deepnarain as President in the hope of a “safe” address,– just as Berhampur was selected as a “safe” place – only resulted in a fresh testimony to the growth of the new ideas.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is all very plausible to the ear and easily imposes on the average unthinking mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Union, concord, work for the country are all moving and sacred words and must command respect – when they are not misused.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But what is it that these politicians ask us to do in the name of union, concord and work for the country?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>They ask us to sacrifice or stifle our convictions and silence the promptings of conscience in order to follow leaders whom we believe to have lost touch with the spirit of the times and “work together unitedly” in a line of action which we believe to be ruinous to the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The demand has been made quite nakedly by enthusiastic adherents of Babu Surendranath Banerji that we should all follow the leaders blindly even when we disapprove of what they think, say and do.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>A more presumptuous demand or one more destructive of all political morality and honesty could not be made.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There is such a thing as a political conscience, even if its existence is not recognised by the editor of the <i>Bengalee</i>; and expediency is not what that veracious journal declares it to be, the sole god of politics, but a subordinate guide, itself determined by higher considerations.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We should be the last to deny it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The whole system of party politics, for example, depends on the subordination of minor differences by those who are agreed on main and vital points.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>So long therefore as the differences are minor and either essentially or for the moment immaterial, there is no reason why there should not be complete unity for all practical purposes; but the moment vital differences arise, parties and party struggle become inevitable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The men of peace and unity are never weary of throwing Japan and England in our faces; but they seem not to have read the history of the countries which they offer us as our examples.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Simply, whether Shogun or Mikado should be leader and sovereign in Japan.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 728"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>In a country where subjection has long become a habit of the public mind, there will always be a tendency to shrink from the realities of the position and to hunt for roundabout, safe and peaceful paths to national regeneration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Servitude is painful and intolerable, servitude is killing the nation by inches, servitude must be got rid of, true; but the pains and evils of servitude seem almost more tolerable to a good many people than the sharp, salutary pangs of a resolute struggle for liberty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Hence the not uncommon cry, “The violent and frequently bloody methods followed by other nations are not suited to a gentle, spiritual and law-abiding people; we will vindicate our intellectual originality and spiritual superiority by inventing new methods of regeneration much more gentlemanly and civilised.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The result is a hydra-brood of delusions, two springing up where one is killed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The old gospel of salvation by prayer was based on the belief in the spiritual superiority of the British people,– an illusion which future generations will look back upon with an amazed incredulity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>God answers prayer<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="151" href="#">1</a> and the British people are godlike in their nature; so why should we despair?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Even now there are prominent politicians who say and perhaps believe that although there is no historical example of a nation liberated by petition and prayer, yet the book of history is not closed and there is no reason why so liberal and noble a nation as the British should not open a new and unprecedented chapter; a miracle which never happened before in the world’s records may very well be worked for the sole and particular benefit of India!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The petitionary delusion, however, though not yet killed, has been scotched; its lease of life is not for long.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE">Another delusion of which Babu Narendranath Sen of the <i>Indian Mirror</i>, and the cultured and eloquent lady whom the Mahatmas have placed at the head of the new Theosophist Church, are the principal exponents, asks us to seek our regeneration through religion; only when we have become religiously and morally fit, can we hope to be politically free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>In spite of the confusion of ideas which underlies this theory, it is one which has a natural charm for a religiously-minded people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless it is as much a thing in the air as the petitionary delusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>If by religion is meant the <i>nivritti-marga</i> it is an absurdity to talk of politics and religion in the same breath; for it is the path of the few,– the saints and the elect – to whom there is no I nor thou, no mine or thine, and therefore no my country or thy country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But if we are asked to perfect our religious development in the <i>pravritti-marga</i>, then it is obvious that politics is as much a part of <i>pravritti-marga</i> as any other activity, and there is no rationality in asking us to practise religion and morality first and politics afterwards; for politics is itself a large part of religion and morality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We acknowledge that nothing is likely to become an<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="152" href="#">2</a> universal and master impulse in India which is not identified with religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The obvious course is to recognise that politics is religion and infuse it with the spirit of religion; for that is the true patriotism which sees God as the Mother in our country, God as Shakti in the mass of our countrymen, and religiously devotes itself to their service and their liberation from present sufferings and servitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>We do not acknowledge that a nation of slaves who acquiesce in their subjection can become morally fit for freedom; one day of slavery robs a man of half his manhood, and while the yoke remains, he cannot compass a perfect and rounded moral development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Under a light and qualified subjection, he may indeed develop in certain directions; but in what direction are we asked to develop?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>In the morality of the slave, the Shudra, whose <i>dharma</i> is humility, contentment, service, obedience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In the morality of the merchant whose <i>dharma</i> is to amass riches by honesty and enterprise and spend them with liberal philanthropy?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>In the morality of the Brahmin whose <i>dharma</i> is to prepare himself for the <i>nivritti-marga</i> by learning and holy <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> exercises, to forgive injuries and accept honour or insult, wrong and injustice, with a calm and untroubled mind?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is obvious that we may develop far on these lines without coming at all nearer to moral fitness for freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Politics is the work of the Kshatriya and it is the virtues of the Kshatriya we must develop if we are to be morally fit for freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But the first virtue of the Kshatriya is not to bow his neck to an unjust yoke but to protect his weak and suffering countrymen against the oppressor and welcome death in a just and righteous battle.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 730"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>A third delusion to which the over-intellectualised are subject is the belief in salvation by industrialism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>One great danger of the commercial aspect of the Swadeshi movement is that many of our young men may be misled into thinking that their true mission is to go abroad, study industries and return to enrich themselves and their country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We would warn them against this pernicious error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This work is an admirable work and a necessary part of the great national <i>yajna</i> which we have instituted; but it is only a part and not even the chief part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Those who have never studied Japanese history, are fond of telling our young men that Japan owes her greatness to her commercial and industrial expansion and call on them to go and do likewise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Commercial and industrial expansion are often accompaniments and results of political liberty and greatness,– never their cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Yet the opposite belief is held by many who should have been capable of wiser discrimination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We find it in the truly marvellous address of Srinath Paul<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="153" href="#">3</a> Rai Bahadoor<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="154" href="#">4</a> at Berhampur; there is a wonderful contrast between the canine gospel of submissive loyalty preached in the first part of the address and the rampageously self-assertive gospel of economic independence preached in its tail-end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>“Whatever the advantages of political advancement, they sink into insignificance when compared with the blessings which industrial prosperity brings in its train,” – such is the gospel according to Srinath Paul<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="155" href="#">5</a> Rai Bahadoor<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="156" href="#">6</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It is so far shared by many less loyal people that they consider industrial prosperity as prior to and the cause of political advancement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The idea is that we must be rich before we can struggle for freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>History does not bear out this peculiar delusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It is the poor </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 239</p>
<p class="PE"> peoples who have been most passionately attached to liberty, while there are many examples to show that nothing more easily leads to national death and decay than a prosperous servitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>We are particularly thankful that British rule has not, like the Roman, given us industrial prosperity in exchange for political independence; for in that case our fate would have been that of the ancient peoples of Gaul and Britain who, buying civilisation and prosperity with the loss of their freemanhood, fell a prey to the Goth and Saxon and entered into a long helotage from which it took them a thousand years to escape.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We must strive indeed for economic independence, because the despotism that rules us is half-mercantile, half-military, and by mortally wounding the lower mercantile half we may considerably disable the upper; at least we shall remove half the inducement England now has for keeping us in absolute subjection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But we should never forget that politics is a work for the Kshatriya and it is not by the virtues and methods of the Vaishya that we shall finally win our independence.<!--/SENT--></p>

Berhampur</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 867"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The spirit of mendicancy has not been given much play in the proceedings of the Berhampur Conference and so far this year marks a distinctive advance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Last year’s Conference was totally exceptional; and there could be no certainty that the victory, then won for reason and patriotism, would be permanent, for the mendicant spirit fled from the Conference Pandal before Kemp’s cudgels and the triumph of the gospel of self-help was accomplished in an atmosphere of such excitement that even the chill blood of a Legislative Councillor was heated into seditious utterance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The very moment after the dispersal of the Conference the mendicant nature reasserted itself, justifying the maxim of the ancients, “Drive out Nature with a pitchfork (or a regulation <i>lathi</i>), yet it will come back at the gallop.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But since then Nationalist sentiment in Bengal has grown immensely in volume; and although the Conference was held in a Moderate centre, in the peaceful and untroubled atmosphere of West Bengal, no positive mendicancy was permitted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>There were, indeed, certain features of the Conference which we cannot view with approval.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Last year the right of raising the cry of the Motherland wherever even two or three of her sons might meet, whether in public places or private, was asserted by the whole body of delegates in spite of police cudgels; this year the right was surrendered because Babu Baikunthanath Sen had pledged his personal honour to a foreign bureaucrat that there would be no breach of the peace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Since this plea was accepted by the delegates, we must take it that all Bengal has acknowledged the shouting of “Bande Mataram” in the streets to be a breach of the peace!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Here is a victory for the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>And yet the Chairman of the Reception Committee </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 245</p>
<p class="PE"> was not ashamed to include in his rotund rhetorical phrases congratulations on our triumph and our scars of victory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The private and personal honour of Babu Baikunthanath was set in the balance against the public honour of the delegates of Bengal, and the latter kicked the beam.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It will be said that the position of Babu Baikunthanath as host precluded the delegates from doing anything which would compromise that estimable gentleman.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We deny that Babu Baikunthanath stood in the position of host to the Conference, whatever may have been his relation to individual delegates; in any case the representatives of Bengal went to Berhampur not to eat good dinners and interchange kindly social courtesies, but simply and solely to do their duty by the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We deny the right of any individual, whatever his position, to pledge a whole nation to a course inconsistent with courage and with honour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But the leaders seem to have accepted the plea with alacrity as a good excuse for avoiding a repetition of Barisal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>“For such another field they dreaded worse than death.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The incident shows the persistence of that want of backbone which is still the curse of our politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>In any other country the very fact that the delegates had been assaulted at one Conference for asserting a right, would have been held an imperative reason for reasserting that right at every succeeding Conference, till it was admitted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Unless we can show the same firmness, we may as well give up the idea of passive resistance for good and all.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 868"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Several of the Resolutions seem to us unnecessary in substance and others invertebrate in phrasing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>We have no faith whatever in the Judicial and Executive separation nostrum; we do not believe that it will really remedy the evil which it is designed to meet.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>So long as the executive and judiciary are both in the pay of the same irresponsible and despotic authority, they will for the most part be actuated by the same spirit and act in unison; the relief given will only be in individual cases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Even that much relief we cannot be sure of; for the moment the functions are separated, it will become an imperious need for the bureaucracy to tighten their hold on the judiciary, and, with all the power in their hands, they will not find the task </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 246</p>
<p class="PE"> difficult.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Already the High Court itself has long ceased to be the “palladium of justice and liberty” against bureaucratic vagaries, and the unanimity of the two Services is likely to be intensified by the so-called reform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>It is quite possible that the separation will make things worse rather than better.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>One reform and one alone can secure us from executive oppression and that is to make the people of this country paymasters and controllers of both executive and judiciary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>No patchwork in any direction will be of any avail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>What for instance is the use of clamouring about the Road Cess when we know perfectly well that it was levied not for roads and other district purposes but as a plausible means of circumventing the Permanent Settlement?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>No one can deny that it is admirably fulfilling the purpose for which it was levied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is absurd to think that the bureaucracy will be anxious to open out the country any further<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="158" href="#">1</a> than is necessary for military and administrative purposes and for the greater facility of exploitation by the foreign trader and capitalist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The needs and convenience of the people are not and can never be a determining factor in their expenditure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>For the same reason they cannot be expected to look to sanitation beyond the limit necessary in order to safeguard the health of Europeans and avoid in the world’s eyes manifest self-betrayal as an inefficient, reactionary and uncivilised administration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Really to secure the public health and effectually combat the plagues that are rapidly destroying our vitality, swelling the death-rate and diminishing the birth-rate, would demand an amount of co-operation with the people for which they will never be willing to pay the price.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 869"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>With the exception of these minor triflings and of one glaring omission beside which all its omissions and commissions fade into insignificance, the work of the Conference has on the whole been satisfactory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is well that it has sanctioned the taking up of sanitation measures by popular agency; it is well that it has dealt with the question of arbitration and that it has approved of measures for grappling with the urgent question of scarcity and famine.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Any unscrupulous or indigent European can sell a weapon to an Indian without the police being aware of the fact (how can they be aware?) and the question arises whether the punishment for a breach of this kind of the Arms Act should not be made absolutely deterrent.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The account of the characteristic proceedings of Sir Pherozshah Mehta at the Surat Conference, which we published in yesterday’s correspondence columns, bears a strong family likeness to the ways of the Provincial Congress autocrats all India over.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The selection of a subservient President who will call white black at dictatorial bidding; the open scorn of public opinion; the disregard of justice, of fair play, of constitutional practice and procedure, of equality of all before recognised law and rule, and of every other principle essential to a self-governing body; the arrogant claim on account of past “services” to assert private wishes, opinions, conveniences, as superior to the wishes, opinions and conveniences of the people’s delegates; these are common and universal characteristics in the procedure of our autocratic democrats.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The difference is merely in personal temperament and manner of expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>“The State?<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>I am the country!” cries Sir Pherozshah Mehta or Pundit Madan Mohan Malaviya or Mr. Krishnaswamy Aiyar, as the case may be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Only, as his personality is more robust, so is Sir Pherozshah’s dictatorial arrogance more public, open and contemptuous than that of his compeers in less favoured Provinces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>If the popular cause is to make any progress, if we are to show ourselves worthy of the self-government we claim, this strong-handed autocracy must itself be put down with the strong hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>As Mr. Tilak pointed out at Kolhapur<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="163" href="#">1</a>, the object of the national movement is not to replace foreign autocrats by the Swadeshi article, but to replace an irresponsible bureaucracy by popular self-government.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE">The most extraordinary of Sir Pherozshah’s freaks at Surat was not his treatment of Sir Bhalchandra as if the President of the Conference were his tame cat,– for what else was the Knight of the Umbrella, pushed into a position to which he has no claims of any kind?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Nor was it his exclusion of the Aundh Commission from consideration by the Conference; it is part of the orthodox Congress “nationalism” to exclude the Princes and Chiefs of India from consideration as if they were not an important part of the nation, and to leave them without sympathy or support to the tender mercies of the Foreign Office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Nor was it his turning the Conference into a tool for ventilating his personal grievances against Bombay officialdom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It was his action with regard to the question of National Education.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 889"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Let us consider one by one the pleas by which he managed to exclude this all-important Resolution from the deliberations of the Conference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>They show the peculiar mental texture of our leaders and their crude notions of the politics which they profess.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The first plea is that the Resolutions of the Congress are not binding upon the Conference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>What then is the necessity or purpose of the Congress?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>As we understand it, the Resolutions of the Congress embody the opinions and aspirations of the united people of India; they put forward the minimum reforms which that people are agreed to demand from the Government or to effect for themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>A Provincial Conference can go beyond these minimum reforms if the circumstances of the Province or the general opinion of the public demand it; it cannot diminish, ignore or go behind them without dissociating itself from the programme approved by the nation and breaking up all chances of an united advance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If these are not the relations of Congress and Conference, will Sir Pherozshah inform us what are the true relations?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>If the Conference does not exist in order to carry forward the national programme with whatever additions the Province may find necessary for its own purposes, does it then exist only in order to record the decrees and opinions of a few Provincial leaders?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 890"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The second plea was that Sir Pherozshah Mehta could not understand the meaning of National Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>At Ahmedabad, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 255</p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The nation was not to resolve on helping forward its commercial independence, because Sir Pherozshah Mehta preferred broadcloth to any other wear.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>And now the people of Bombay are not to educate themselves on national lines because Sir Pherozshah Mehta does not know what a nation means nor what nationalism means nor, in fact, anything except what Sir Pherozshah Mehta means.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 891"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>When, on a vote of the Subjects Committee, the Resolution was declared by the President to be lost, it seems to have been the opinion of a large body of the delegates that this was a mis-declaration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The obvious course was, under such circumstances, a count of votes by tellers on each side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But Sir Pherozshah was ready with his third plea that this would be to question the veracity of the President.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We cannot too strongly insist that politics is not a social drawing-room for the interchange of courtly amenities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Where there is a question of constitutional right, to bring in personal arguments of this kind is to show that you have not grasped the elementary principles of democratic politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The very first of these principles is that law rules and not persons,– the person is only an instrument of the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The President or Chairman of a body sits there to keep order and see that law and rule are observed,– he does not sit there to make his own will the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>If therefore there is any question of a miscount, it is his bounden duty to see that immediate measures are taken to satisfy both parties as to its correctness and it is the natural right of the members to demand such a count.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>That right ought not to be waived in deference to the tender delicacy of a Chairman’s self-love, nor has he or his friends any right to talk nonsense about his veracity being questioned or himself being insulted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Such mouthings show either a guilty conscience which cannot face public scrutiny or an entire moral unfitness for leadership in any constitutional proceedings.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 902"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>While commenting on the proceedings of the Berhampur Conference, we expressed our opinion that the leaders had been guilty of the most serious deficiency in statesmanship and courage in failing to understand and meet the situation created by the occurrences in Tipperah.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Leadership in this country has hitherto gone with the fluent tongue, the sonorous voice, skill in dialectics and acute adroitness in legal draftsmanship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The leader has not been called upon to understand the great and urgent national needs or to meet the calls of a dangerous crisis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In the opposition-cum-co-operation theory these were functions of the alien Government, and the only duty of the popular leaders was to advise or remonstrate and look on at the results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The present position in Bengal is full of the uncertainty and confusion of a transition period when circumstances have changed and demand new qualities, new ideas and a new spirit in the people’s chiefs; but the leadership still remains in the hands of the old type of politicians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This would not have mattered if the old leaders had been men of genius gifted with the adaptability to suit themselves to the new circumstances, the vision to grasp them and the courage to act.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But none of these qualities seems to be possessed either by Babu Surendranath, the one man of genius among the older leaders, or by Mr. Gokhale, the one man of real political ability, much less by the lesser heads.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 903"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Comilla affair has revealed beyond all possible doubt the heart of the new situation.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is evidently to isolate the struggle and fight it out in East Bengal; to oppose and put down the new spirit after it had taken hold of the whole nation would be a task so difficult as to be a practical impossibility; to meet it in a single part of the country and crush it before it had time to spread effectively over all India, is obviously the wisest course.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is part of the policy also to attack it by localities even in the affected area and not as a whole, to destroy it before the defence has organised itself; and to use as instruments the Salimullahi<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="164" href="#">1</a> sect of Mahomedans, while the Police confine themselves to keeping the ring.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 904"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The leaders may say that they thought the Comilla incident an unwelcome and deplorable outbreak which had happily been closed whether by the “secret” efforts of Babu Surendranath Banerji or by other less miraculous means.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>That they did think so, is probable and nothing could more damningly convict them of want of insight and even the smallest measure of political wisdom than such an inexcusable blunder.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It was perfectly obvious that, as Comilla had not been the first incident of the kind, so also it would not be the last.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Before the Conference met the disturbance at Mogra Hat was already in full course; and the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="165" href="#">2</a> details, reported in Babu Surendranath Banerji’s own paper, were of the most glaringly unmistakable character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>At Comilla there had been an outbreak of anti-national hooliganism coincident with the Nawab’s visit; the authorities had practically refused </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 260</p>
<p class="PE"> to help the Hindus and had only interfered when the Hindus were getting the upper hand; and even then, the arrest and punishment of a few rioters was so casually and lightly done as to be absolutely useless for any deterrent effect while the might of the bureaucracy was centred upon the prosecution of alleged Hindu culprits in the shooting case.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>A Mahomedan Police official seems to have acted practically as the captain of the rioters; the Subdivisional Officer tried to deprive the Hindus of the means of self-defence; attempts were made to prevent organisation of defence by volunteers; a Police force held the station to exclude help from outside for the Hindus, leaving the Mahomedan rioters a clear field for their operations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Finally when in spite of all these obstructions the Hindus were again getting the upper hand, the higher authorities appeared on the scene, the disturbance was quelled, and arrests and prosecutions of Hindus are now in full swing.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">I. Introduction<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 910"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>In a series of articles, published in this paper soon after the Calcutta session of the Congress, we sought to indicate our view both of the ideal which the Congress had adopted, the ideal of Swaraj or self-government as it exists in the United Kingdom or the Colonies, and of the possible lines of policy by which that ideal might be attained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>There are, we pointed out, only three possible policies; petitioning, an unprecedented way of attempting a nation’s liberty, which cannot possibly succeed except under conditions which have not yet existed among human beings; self-development and self-help; and the old orthodox historical method of organised resistance to the existing form of government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We acknowledged<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="166" href="#">2</a> that the policy of self-development which the New party had forced to the front, was itself a novel departure under the circumstances of modern India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Self-development of an independent nation is one thing; self-development from a state of servitude under an alien and despotic rule without the forcible or peaceful removal of that rule as an indispensable preliminary, is quite another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>No national self-development is possible without the support of <i>rajshakti</i>, organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="167" href="#">3</a> political strength, commanding, and whenever necessary compelling general allegiance and obedience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>A caste may develop, a particular community may develop by its own efforts supported by a strong social organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="168" href="#">4</a>; a nation cannot.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Industrially, socially, educationally there can be no genuine progress carrying the whole nation forward, unless there is a central force representing either the best thought and energy of the country or else the majority of its citizens and able to enforce the views and decisions of the nation on all its constituent members.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Because Japan had such a central authority, she was able in thirty years to face Europe as an equal; because we in India neither had such an authority nor tried </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 266</p>
<p class="PE"> to develop it, but supported each tottering step by clinging to the step-motherly apron strings of a foreign Government, our record of more than seventy years has not been equal to one year of Japan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We have fumbled through the nineteenth century, prattling of enlightenment and national regeneration; and the result has been not national progress, but national confusion and weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Individuals here and there might emancipate themselves and come to greatness; particular communities might show a partial and one-sided development, for a time only; but the nation instead of progressing, sank into a very slough of weakness, helplessness and despondency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Political freedom is the life-breath of a nation; to attempt social reform, educational reform, industrial expansion, the moral improvement of the race without aiming first and foremost at political freedom, is the very height of ignorance and futility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Such attempts are foredoomed to disappointment and failure; yet when the disappointment and failure come, we choose to attribute them to some radical defect in the national character, as if the nation were at fault and not its wise men who would not or could not understand the first elementary conditions of success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The primary requisite for national progress, national reform, is the free habit of free and healthy national thought and action which is impossible in a state of servitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The second is the organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="169" href="#">5</a> of the national will in a strong central authority.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 911"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>How impossible it is to carry out efficiently any large national object in the absence of this authority was shown by the fate of the Boycott in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is idle to disguise from ourselves that the Boycott is not as yet effective except spasmodically and in patches.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Yet to carry through the Boycott was a solemn national decision which has not been reversed but rather repeatedly confirmed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Never indeed has the national will been so generally and unmistakeably<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="170" href="#">6</a> declared; but for the want of a central authority to work for the necessary conditions, to support by its ubiquitous presence the weak and irresolute and to coerce the refractory, it has not been properly carried out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>For the same reason national education languishes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>For the same reason every attempt at large national action has failed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It is idle to talk of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 267</p>
<p class="PE"> self-development unless we first evolve a suitable central authority or Government which all will or must accept.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The Japanese perceived this at a very early stage and leaving aside all other matters, devoted their first energies to the creation of such an authority in the person of the Mikado and his Government, holding it cheaply purchased even at the price of temporary internal discord and civil slaughter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We also must develop a central authority, which shall be a popular Government in fact though not in name.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But Japan was independent; we have to establish a popular authority which will exist side by side and in rivalry with a despotic foreign bureaucracy – no ordinary rough-riding despotism, but quiet, pervasive and subtle, one that has fastened its grip on every detail of our national life and will not easily be persuaded to let go, even in the least degree, its octopus-like hold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This popular authority will have to dispute every part of our national life and activity, one by one, step by step, with the intruding force to the extreme point of entire emancipation from alien control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This and no less than this is the task before us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>A Moderate critic characterised it at the time as an unheroic programme; but to us it seems so heroic that we frankly acknowledge its novelty and audacity and the uncertainty of success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>For success depends on the presence of several very rare conditions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It demands in the first place a country for its field of action in which the people are more powerfully swayed by the fear of social excommunication and the general censure of their fellows than by the written law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It demands a country where the capacity for extreme self-denial is part of the national character or for centuries has taken a prominent place in the national discipline.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>These conditions exist in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But it requires also an iron endurance, tenacity, doggedness far above anything that is needed for the more usual military revolt or sanguinary revolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>These qualities we have not as yet developed at least in Bengal; but they are easily generated by suffering and necessity and hardened into permanence by a prolonged struggle with superior power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>There is nothing like a strong pressure from above to harden and concentrate what lies below – always provided that the superior pressure is not such as to crush the substance on <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> which it is acting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The last requisite therefore for the success of the policy of self-development against the pressure of foreign rule is that the bureaucracy will so far respect its former traditions and professions as not to interfere finally with any course of action of the popular authority which does not itself try violently to subvert the connection of the British Empire with India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is extremely doubtful whether this last condition will be satisfied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>It is easy to see how the bureaucracy might put a summary end to National Education or an effective check on industrial expansion or do away arbitrarily with popular Arbitration Courts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It is easy to see how the temptation to resort to Russian methods on a much larger and effective scale than that of mere Fullerism might prove too strong for a privileged class which felt power slipping from its hold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>We therefore said in our previous articles that we must carry on the attempt at self-development as long as we were permitted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>What would be our next recourse<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="171" href="#">7</a> if it were no longer permitted it is too early to discuss.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 912"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The attempt at self-development by self-help is absolutely necessary for our national salvation, whether we can carry it peacefully to the end or not.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>In no other way can we get rid of the fatal dependence, passivity and helplessness in which a century of all-pervasive British control has confirmed us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>To recover the habit of independent motion and independent action is the first necessity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It was for this reason that after extreme provocation and full conviction of the hopelessness otherwise of inducing any change of policy in the older politicians, the leaders of the new school decided to form an independent party and place their views as an independent programme before the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Their action, though much blamed at the time, has been thoroughly justified by results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The National Congress has not indeed broken with the old petitioning traditions, but it has admitted the new policy as an essential part of the national programme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Swadeshi and National Education have been recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="172" href="#">8</a>, and, in all probability, Arbitration will be given its proper prominence at the next session; Boycott has been admitted as permissible in principle to all parts of India though the recommendation to extend it in practice as an integral part of the national policy was </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 269</p>
<p class="PE"> not pressed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>It only remained to develop the central authority which will execute the national policy and evolve with time into a popular Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>It was for this object that the New party determined not to be satisfied with any further evasion of the constitution question, though they did not press for the adoption of their own particular scheme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>It is for this object that a Central National Committee has been formed; that Conferences are being held in various districts and sub-divisions and committees created; that the Provincial Conferences are expected to appoint a Provincial Committee for all Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The mere creation of these Committees will not provide us with our central authority, nor will they be really effective for the purpose until the new spirit and the new views are paramount in the whole country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>But it is the first step which costs and the first step has been taken.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 913"><!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>So far, well; but the opposition of the bureaucracy to the national self-development must be taken into account.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Opposition, not necessarily final and violent, will undoubtedly be offered; and we have not as yet considered the organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="173" href="#">9</a> of any means by which it can be effectually met.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>Obviously we shall have to fall back on the third policy of organised resistance, and have only to decide what form the resistance should take, passive or active, defensive or aggressive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It is well known that the New party long ago formulated and all Bengal has in theory accepted, the doctrine of passive, or, as it might be more comprehensively termed, defensive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>We have therefore not only to organize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="174" href="#">10</a> a central authority, not only to take up all branches of our national life into our hands, but in order to meet bureaucratic opposition and to compel the alien control to remove its hold on us, if not at once, then tentacle by tentacle we must organize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="175" href="#">11</a> defensive resistance.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 917"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="176" href="#">1</a> resistance to an existing form of government may be undertaken either for the vindication of national liberty, or in order to substitute one form of government for another, or to remove particular objectionable features in the existing system without any entire or radical alteration of the whole, or simply for the redress of particular grievances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Our political agitation in the nineteenth century was entirely confined to the smaller and narrower objects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>To replace an oppressive land revenue system by the security of a Permanent Settlement, to mitigate executive tyranny by the separation of judicial from executive functions, to diminish the drain on the country naturally resulting from foreign rule by more liberal employment of Indians in the services – to these half-way houses our wise men and political seers directed our steps, with this limited ideal they confined the rising hopes and imaginations of a mighty people reawakening after a great downfall.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Their political inexperience prevented them from realising that these measures on which we have misspent half a century of unavailing effort, were not only paltry and partial in their scope but in their nature ineffective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>A Permanent Settlement can always be evaded by a spendthrift Government bent on increasing its resources and unchecked by any system of popular control; there is no limit to the possible number of cesses and local taxes by which the Settlement could be practically violated without any direct infringement of its provisions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The mere deprivation of judicial functions will not disarm executive tyranny so long as both executive and judiciary are mainly white and subservient to a central authority irresponsible, alien and bureaucratic; for the central authority can always tighten its grip on the judiciary of which it is the controller and paymaster and habituate it to a consistent support of executive action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Nor will Simultaneous Examinations and the liberal appointment of Indians </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 271</p>
<p class="PE"> mend the matter; for an Englishman serves the Government as a member of the same ruling race and can afford to be occasionally independent; but the Indian civilian is a serf masquerading as a heaven-born and can only deserve favour and promotion by his zeal in fastening the yoke heavier upon his fellow-countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>As a rule the foreign Government can rely on the “native” civilian to be more zealously oppressive than even the average Anglo-Indian official.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Neither would the panacea of Simultaneous Examinations really put an end to the burden of the drain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The Congress insistence on the Home Charges for a long time obscured the real accusation against British rule; for it substituted a particular grievance for a radical and congenital evil implied in the very existence of British control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The huge price India has to pay England for the inestimable privilege of being ruled by Englishmen is a small thing compared with the murderous drain by which we purchase the more exquisite privilege of being exploited by British capital.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The diminution of the Home<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="177" href="#">2</a> Charges will not prevent the gradual death by bleeding of which exploitation is the true and abiding cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Thus, even for the partial objects they were intended to secure, the measures for which we petitioned and clamoured in the last century were hopelessly ineffective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>So was it with all the Congress nostrums; they were palliatives which could not even be counted upon to palliate; the radical evil, uncured, would only be driven from one seat in the body politic to take refuge in others where it would soon declare its presence by equally troublesome symptoms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The only true cure for a bad and oppressive financial system is to give the control over taxation to the people whose money pays for the needs of Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The only effective way of putting an end to executive tyranny is to make the people and not an irresponsible Government the controller and paymaster of both executive and judiciary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The only possible method of stopping the drain is to establish a popular government which may be relied on to foster and protect Indian commerce and Indian industry conducted by Indian capital and employing Indian labour.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 924"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We have defined, so far, the occasion and the ultimate object of the passive resistance we preach.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is the only effective means, except actual armed revolt, by which the organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="190" href="#">1</a> strength of the nation, gathering to a powerful central authority and guided by the principle of self-development and self-help, can wrest the control of our national life from the grip of an alien bureaucracy, and thus, developing into a free popular Government, naturally replace the bureaucracy it extrudes until the process culminates in a self-governed India, liberated from foreign control.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The mere effort at self-development, unaided by some kind of resistance, will not materially help us towards our goal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Merely by developing national schools and colleges we shall not induce or force the bureaucracy to give up to us the control of education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Merely by attempting to expand some of our trades and industries, we shall not drive out the British exploiter or take from the British Government its sovereign power of regulating, checking or killing the growth of Swadeshi industries by the imposition of judicious taxes and duties and other methods always open to the controller of a country’s finance and legislation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Still less shall we be able by that harmless means to get for ourselves the control of taxation and expenditure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Nor shall we, merely by establishing our own arbitration courts, oblige the alien control to give up the elaborate and lucrative system of civil and criminal judicature which at once emasculates the nation and makes it pay heavily for its own emasculation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In none of these matters is the bureaucracy likely to budge an inch from its secure position unless it is forcibly persuaded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The control of the young mind in its most impressionable period is of vital importance to the continuance of the hypnotic spell by which alone the foreign domination manages to subsist; the exploitation of the country is the chief reason for its existence; the control of the judiciary is </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 276</p>
<p class="PE"> one of its chief instruments of repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>None of these things can it yield up without bringing itself nearer to its doom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is only by organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="191" href="#">2</a> national resistance, passive or aggressive, that we can make our self-development effectual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>For if the self-help movement only succeeds in bringing about some modification of educational methods, some readjustment of the balance of trade, some alleviation of the curse of litigation, then, whatever else it may have succeeded in doing, it will have failed of its main object.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The new school at least have not advocated the policy of self-development merely out of a disinterested ardour for moral improvement or under the spur of an inoffensive philanthropic patriotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This attitude they leave to saints and philosophers,– saints like the editor of the <i>Indian Mirror</i> or philosophers like the ardent Indian Liberals who sit at the feet of Mr. John Morley.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>They for their part speak and write frankly as politicians aiming at a definite and urgent political object by a way which shall be reasonably rapid and yet permanent in its results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>We may have our own educational theories; but we advocate national education not as an educational experiment or to subserve any theory, but as the only way to secure truly national and patriotic control and discipline for the mind of the country in its malleable youth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We desire industrial expansion, but Swadeshi without boycott,– non-political Swadeshi, Lord Minto’s “honest” Swadeshi – has no attractions for us, since we know that it can bring no safe and permanent national gain; that can only be secured by the industrial and fiscal independence of the Indian nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Our immediate problem as a nation is not how to be intellectual and well-informed or how to be rich and industrious, but how to stave off imminent national death, how to put an end to the white peril, how to assert ourselves and live.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It is for this reason that whatever minor differences there may be between different exponents of the new spirit, they are all agreed on the immediate necessity of an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="192" href="#">3</a> national resistance to the state of things which is crushing us out of existence as a nation and on the one goal of that resistance,– freedom.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 925"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="193" href="#">4</a> national resistance to existing conditions, whether directed against the system of government as such or against </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 277</p>
<p class="PE"> some particular feature of it, has three courses open to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It may attempt to make administration under existing conditions impossible by an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="194" href="#">5</a> passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This was the policy initiated by the genius of Parnell when by the plan of campaign he prevented the payment of rents in Ireland and by persistent obstruction hampered the transaction of any but Irish business in Westminster.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>It may attempt to make administration under existing conditions impossible by an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="195" href="#">6</a> aggressive resistance in the shape of an untiring and implacable campaign of assassination and a confused welter of riots, strikes and agrarian risings all over the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>This is the spectacle we have all watched with such eager interest in Russia.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We have seen the most absolute autocrat and the most powerful and ruthless bureaucracy in the world still in unimpaired possession of all the most effective means of repression, yet beaten to the knees by the determined resistance of an unarmed nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It has mistakenly been said that the summoning of the Duma was a triumph for passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But the series of strikes on a gigantic scale which figured so largely in the final stages of the struggle was only one feature of that widespread, desperate and unappeasable anarchy which led to the first triumph of Russian liberty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Against such an anarchy the mightiest and best-organised Government must necessarily feel helpless; its repression would demand a systematic and prolonged course of massacre on a colossal scale the prospect of which would have paralysed the vigour of the most ruthless and energetic despotism even of mediaeval times.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Only by concessions and compromises could such a resistance be overcome.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The third course open to an oppressed nation is that of armed revolt, which instead of bringing existing conditions to an end by making their continuance impossible sweeps them bodily out of existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>This is the old time-honoured method which the oppressed or enslaved have always adopted by preference in the past and will always adopt<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="196" href="#">7</a> in the future if they see any chance of success; for it is the readiest and swiftest, the most thorough in its results, and demands the least powers of endurance and suffering and the smallest and briefest sacrifices.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 926"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The choice by a subject nation of the means it will use for </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 278</p>
<p class="PE"> vindicating its liberty, is best determined by the circumstances of its servitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The present circumstances in India seem to point to passive resistance as our most natural and suitable weapon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We would not for a moment be understood to base this conclusion upon any condemnation of other methods as in all circumstances criminal and unjustifiable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It is the common habit of established Governments and especially those which are themselves oppressors, to brand all violent methods in subject peoples and communities as criminal and wicked.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>When you have disarmed your slaves and legalised the infliction of bonds, stripes and death on any one of them, man, woman or child, who may dare to speak or to act against you, it is natural and convenient to try and lay a moral as well as a legal ban on any attempt to answer violence by violence, the knout by the revolver, the prison by riot or agrarian rising, the gallows by the dynamite bomb.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>But no nation yet has listened to the cant of the oppressor when itself put to the test, and the general conscience of humanity approves the refusal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Under certain circumstances a civil struggle becomes in reality a battle and the morality of war is different from the morality of peace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>To shrink from bloodshed and violence under such circumstances is a weakness deserving as severe a rebuke as Srikrishna addressed to Arjuna when he shrank from the colossal civil slaughter on the field of Kurukshetra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Liberty is the life-breath of a nation; and when the life is attacked, when it is sought to suppress all chance of breathing by violent pressure, any and every means of self-preservation becomes right and justifiable,– just as it is lawful for a man who is being strangled to rid himself of the pressure on his throat by any means in his power.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>It is the nature of the pressure which determines the nature of the resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Where, as in Russia, the denial of liberty is enforced by legalised murder and outrage, or, as in Ireland formerly, by brutal coercion, the answer of violence to violence is justified and inevitable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Where the need for immediate liberty is urgent and it is a present question of national life or death on the instant, revolt is the only course.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>But where the oppression is legal and subtle in its methods and respects life, liberty and property and there is still breathing time, <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> the circumstances demand that we should make the experiment of a method of resolute but peaceful resistance which while less bold and aggressive than other methods, calls for perhaps as much heroism of a kind and certainly more universal endurance and suffering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>In other methods, a daring minority purchase with their blood the freedom of the millions; but for passive resistance it is necessary that all should share in the struggle and the privation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 927"><!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>This peculiar character of passive resistance is one reason why it has found favour with the thinkers of the New party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>There are certain moral qualities necessary to self-government which have become atrophied by long disuse in our people and can only be restored either by the healthy air of a free national life in which alone they can permanently thrive or by their vigorous exercise in the intensity of a national struggle for freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>If by any possibility the nation can start its career of freedom with a fully developed unity and strength, it will certainly have a better chance of immediate greatness hereafter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>Passive resistance affords the best possible training for these qualities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Something also is due to our friends, the enemy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>We have ourselves made them reactionary and oppressive and deserved the Government we possess.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The reason why even a radical opportunist like Mr. Morley refuses us self-government is not that he does not believe in India’s fitness for self-government, but that he does not believe in India’s determination to be free; on the contrary, the whole experience of the past shows that we have not been in earnest in our demand for self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>We should put our determination beyond a doubt and thereby give England a chance of redeeming her ancient promises, made when her rule was still precarious and unstable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>For the rest, circumstances still favour the case of passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>In spite of occasional Fullerism the bureaucracy has not yet made up its mind to a Russian system of repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It is true that for India also it is now a question of national life or death.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>Morally and materially she has been brought to the verge of exhaustion and decay by the bureaucratic rule and any farther acquiescence in servitude will result in that death-sleep of centuries from which a nation, if it ever awakes at </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 280</p>
<p class="PE"> all, wakes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="197" href="#">8</a> emaciated, feeble and unable to resume its true rank in the list of the peoples.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>But there is still time to try the effect of an united and unflinching pressure of passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>The resistance, if it is to be of any use, must be united and unflinching.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>If from any timidity or selfishness or any mistaken ideas of caution and moderation our Moderate patriots succeed in breaking the unity and weakening the force of the resistance, the movement will fail and India will sink into those last depths of degradation when only desperate remedies will be of any utility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>The advocates of self-development and defensive resistance are no extremists but are trying to give the country its last chance of escaping the necessity of extremism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>Defensive resistance is the sole alternative to that ordeal of sanguinary violence on both sides through which all other countries, not excepting the Moderates’ exemplar England, have been compelled to pass, only at last “embracing Liberty over a heap of corpses”.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 931"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The essential difference between passive or defensive and active or aggressive resistance is this, that while the method of the aggressive resister is to do something by which he can bring about positive harm to the Government, the method of the passive resister is to abstain from doing something by which he would be helping the Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The object in both cases is the same,– to force the hands of the Government; the line of attack is different.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The passive method is especially suitable to countries where the Government depends mainly for the continuance of its administration on the voluntary help and acquiescence of the subject people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The first principle of passive resistance, therefore, which the new school have placed in the forefront of their programme, is to make administration under present conditions impossible by an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="198" href="#">1</a> refusal to do anything which shall help either British commerce in the exploitation of the country or British officialdom in the administration of it,– unless and until the conditions are changed in the manner and to the extent demanded by the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This attitude is summed up in the one word, Boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>If we consider the various departments of the administration one by one, we can easily see how administration in each can be rendered impossible by successfully organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="199" href="#">2</a> refusal of assistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We are dissatisfied with the fiscal and economical conditions of British rule in India, with the foreign exploitation of the country, the continual bleeding of its resources, the chronic famine and rapid impoverishment which result, the refusal of the Government to protect the people and their industries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Accordingly, we refuse to help the process of exploitation and impoverishment in our capacity as consumers, we refuse henceforth to purchase foreign and especially British goods or to condone their purchase by others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>By an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="200" href="#">3</a> and relentless boycott of British goods, we propose to render the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 282</p>
<p class="PE"> farther<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="201" href="#">4</a> exploitation of the country impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We are dissatisfied also with the conditions under which education is imparted in this country, its calculated poverty and insufficiency, its anti-national character, its subordination to the Government and the use made of that subordination for the discouragement of patriotism and the inculcation of loyalty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Accordingly we refuse to send our boys to Government schools or to schools aided and controlled by the Government; if this educational boycott is general and well-organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="202" href="#">5</a>, the educational administration of the country will be rendered impossible and the control of its youthful minds pass out of the hands of the foreigner.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We are dissatisfied with the administration of justice, the ruinous costliness of the civil side, the brutal rigour of its criminal penalties and procedure, its partiality, its frequent subordination to political objects.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We refuse accordingly to have any resort to the alien courts of justice, and by an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="203" href="#">6</a> judicial boycott propose to make the bureaucratic administration of justice impossible while these conditions continue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Finally, we disapprove of the executive administration, its arbitrariness, its meddling and inquisitorial character, its thoroughness of repression, its misuse of the police for the repression instead of the protection of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>We refuse, accordingly, to go to the executive for help or advice or protection or to tolerate any paternal interference in our public activities, and by an organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="204" href="#">7</a> boycott of the executive propose to reduce executive control and interference to a mere skeleton of its former self.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy depends for the success of its administration on the help of the few and the acquiescence of the many.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>If the few refused to help, if Indians no longer consented to teach in Government schools or work in Government offices, or serve the alien as police, the administration could not continue for a day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>We will suppose the bureaucracy able to fill their places by Eurasians, aliens or traitors; even then the refusal of the many to acquiesce, by the simple process of no longer resorting to Government schools, courts of justice or magistrates’ cutcherries<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="205" href="#">8</a>, would put an end to administration.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 932"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Such is the nature of passive resistance as preached by the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 283</p>
<p class="PE"> new school in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is at once clear that self-development and such a scheme of passive resistance are supplementary and necessary to each other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If we refuse to supply our needs from foreign sources we must obviously supply them ourselves; we cannot have the industrial boycott without Swadeshi and the expansion of indigenous industries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>If we decline to enter the alien courts of justice, we must have arbitration courts of our own to settle our disputes and differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If we do not send our boys to schools owned or controlled by the Government, we must have schools of our own in which they may receive a thorough and national education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If we do not go for protection to the executive, we must have a system of self-protection and mutual protection of our own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Just as Swadeshi is the natural accompaniment of an industrial boycott, so also arbitration stands in the same relation to a judicial boycott, national education to an educational boycott, a league of mutual defence to an executive boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>From this close union of self-help with passive resistance it also follows that the new politics do not contemplate the organisation of passive resistance as a temporary measure for partial ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It is not to be dropped as soon as the Government undertakes the protection of indigenous industries, reforms its system of education, improves its courts of justice and moderates its executive rigour and ubiquity, but only when the control of all these functions is vested in a free, constitutional and popular Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We have learned by bitter experience that an alien and irresponsible bureaucracy cannot be relied upon to abstain from rescinding its reforms when convenient or to manage even a reformed administration in the interests of the people.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 933"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The possibilities of passive resistance are not exhausted by the refusal of assistance to the administration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>In Europe its more usual weapon is the refusal to pay taxes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The strenuous political instinct of European races teaches them to aim a direct blow at the most vital part of the administration rather than to undermine it by slower and more gradual means.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The payment of taxes is the most direct assistance given by the community to the administration and the most visible symbol of acquiescence and approval.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>To refuse payment is at once the most emphatic </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 284</p>
<p class="PE"> protest possible short of taking up arms and the sort of attack which the administration will feel immediately and keenly and must therefore parry at once either by conciliation or by methods of repression which will give greater vitality and intensity to the opposition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The refusal to pay taxes is a natural and logical result of the attitude of passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>A boycott of Government schools, for example, may be successful and national schools substituted; but the administration continues to exact from the people a certain amount of revenue for the purposes of education, and is not likely to relinquish its claims; the people will therefore have doubly to tax themselves in order to maintain national education and also to maintain the Government system by which they no longer profit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Under such circumstances the refusal to pay for an education of which they entirely disapprove, comes as a natural consequence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>This was the form of resistance offered by the Dissenters in England to the Education Act of the last Conservative Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The refusal to pay rents was the backbone of the Irish Plan of Campaign.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The refusal to pay taxes levied by an Imperial Government in which they had no voice or share, was the last form of resistance offered by the American colonists previous to taking up arms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Ultimately, in case of the persistent refusal of the administration to listen to reason, the refusal to pay taxes is the strongest and final form of passive resistance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 934"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>This stronger sort of passive resistance has not been included by the new party in its immediate programme, and for valid reasons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>In the first place, all the precedents for this form of resistance were accompanied by certain conditions which do not as yet obtain in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>In the Irish instance, the refusal was not to pay Government taxes but to pay rents to a landlord class who represented an unjust and impoverishing land system maintained in force by a foreign power against the wishes of the people; but in India the foreign bureaucracy has usurped the functions of the landlord, except in Bengal where a refusal to pay rents would injure not a landlord-class supported by the alien but a section of our own countrymen who have been intolerably harassed, depressed and burdened by bureaucratic </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 285</p>
<p class="PE"> policy and bureaucratic exactions and fully sympathise, for the most part, with the national movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>In all other parts of India the refusal to pay rents would be a refusal to pay a Government tax.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>This, as we have said, is the strongest, the final form of passive resistance, and differs from the method of political boycott which involves no breach of legal obligation or direct defiance of administrative authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>No man can be legally punished for using none but Swadeshi articles or persuading others to follow his example or for sending his boys to a National in preference to a Government school, or for settling his differences with others out of court, or for defending his person and property or helping to defend the person and property of his neighbours against criminal attack.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>If the administration interferes with the people in the exercise of these legitimate rights, it invites and compels defiance of its authority and for what may follow the rulers and not the people are responsible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>But the refusal to pay taxes is a breach of legal obligation and a direct defiance of administrative authority precisely of that kind which the administration can least afford to neglect and must either conciliate or crush.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>In a free country, the attempt at repression would probably go no farther than the forcible collection of the payments refused by legal distraint; but in a subject country the bureaucracy, feeling itself vitally threatened, would naturally supplement this legal process by determined prosecution and persecution of the advocates of the policy and its adherents, and, in all probability, by extreme military and police violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The refusal to pay taxes would, therefore, inevitably bring about the last desperate struggle between the forces of national aspiration and alien repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>It would be in the nature of an ultimatum from the people to the Government.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 935"><!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The case of the English Dissenters, although it was a refusal to pay taxes, differed materially from ours.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>The object of their passive resistance was not to bring the Government to its knees, but to generate so strong a feeling in the country that the Conservative Government would be ignominiously brushed out of office at the next elections.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>They had the all-powerful weapon of the vote and could meet and overthrow </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>In India we are very differently circumstanced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>The resistance of the American colonists offers a nearer parallel.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>Like ourselves the Americans met oppression with the weapon of boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>They were not wholly dependent on England and had their own legislatures in local affairs; so they had no occasion to extend the boycott to all departments of national life nor to attempt a general policy of national self-development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Their boycott was limited to British goods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>They had however to go beyond the boycott and refuse to pay the taxes imposed on them against their will; but when they offered the ultimatum to the mother country they were prepared to follow it up, if necessary, and did finally follow it up by a declaration of independence, supported by armed revolt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>Here again there is a material difference from Indian conditions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>An ultimatum should never be presented unless one is prepared to follow it up to its last consequences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>Moreover, in a vast country like India, any such general conflict with dominant authority as is involved in a no-taxes policy, needs for its success a close organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="206" href="#">9</a> linking province to province and district to district and a powerful central authority representing the single will of the whole nation which could alone fight on equal terms the final struggle of defensive resistance with bureaucratic repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_65"><!-- --></a>Such an organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="207" href="#">10</a> and authority has not yet been developed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_66"><!-- --></a>The new politics, therefore, confines itself for the time to the policy of lawful abstention from any kind of co-operation with the Government,– the policy of boycott which is capable of gradual extension, leaving to the bureaucracy the onus of forcing on a more direct, sudden and dangerous struggle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_67"><!-- --></a>Its principle at present is not “no representation, no taxation,” but “no control, no assistance”.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 939"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>In the early days of the new movement it was declared, in a very catching phrase, by a politician who has now turned his back on the doctrine which made him famous, that a subject nation has no politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>And it was commonly said that we as a subject nation should altogether ignore the Government and turn our attention to emancipation by self-help and self-development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>This was the self-development principle carried to its extreme conclusions, and it is not surprising that phrases so trenchant and absolute should have given rise to some misunderstanding.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It was even charged against us by Sir Pherozshah Mehta and other robust exponents of the opposition-cum-co-operation theory that we were advocating non-resistance and submission to political wrong and injustice!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Much water has flowed under the bridges since then, and now we are being charged, in deputations to the Viceroy and elsewhere, with the opposite offence of inflaming and fomenting disturbance and rebellion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Yet our policy remains essentially the same,– not to ignore such a patent and very troublesome fact as the alien bureaucracy, for that was never our policy, but to have nothing to do with it, in the way either of assistance or acquiescence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Far from preaching non-resistance, it has now become abundantly clear that our determination not to submit to political wrong and injustice was far deeper and sterner than that of our critics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The method of opposition differed, of course.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The Moderate method of resistance was verbal only – prayer, petition and protest; the method we proposed was practical,– boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But, as we have pointed out, our new method, though more concrete, was in itself quite as legal and peaceful as the old.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is no offence by law to abstain from Government schools or Government courts of justice or the help and protection of a<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="208" href="#">1</a> fatherly executive or the use of British goods; nor is it illegal to persuade others to join in our abstention.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 940"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 288</p>
<p class="PE">At the same time this legality is neither in itself an essential condition of passive resistance generally, nor can we count upon its continuance as an actual condition of passive resistance as it is to be understood and practised in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The passive resister in other countries has always been prepared to break an unjust and oppressive law whenever necessary and to take the legal consequences, as the non-Conformists in England did when they refused to pay the education rate or as Hampden did when he refused to pay ship-money.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Even under present conditions in India there is at least one direction in which, it appears, many of us are already breaking what Anglo-Indian courts have determined to be the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The law relating to sedition and the law relating to the offence of causing racial enmity are so admirably vague in their terms that there is nothing which can escape from their capacious embrace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It appears from the <i>Punjabee</i> case that it is a crime under bureaucratic rule to say that Europeans hold Indian life cheaply, although this is a fact which case after case has proved and although British justice has confirmed this cheap valuation of our lives by the leniency of its sentences on European murderers; nay, it is a crime to impute such failings to British justice or to say even that departmental enquiries into “accidents” of this kind cannot be trusted, although this is a conviction in which, as everyone is aware, the whole country is practically unanimous as the result of repeated experiences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>All this is not crime indeed when we do it in order to draw the attention of the bureaucracy in the vain hope of getting the grievance redressed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But if our motive is to draw the attention of the people and enlighten them on the actual or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="209" href="#">2</a> inevitable results of irresponsible rule by aliens and the dominance of a single community, we are criminals, we are guilty of breaking the law of the alien.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Yet to break the law in this respect is the duty of every self-respecting publicist who is of our way of thinking.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It is our duty to drive home to the public mind the congenital and incurable evils of the present system of government so that they may insist on its being swept away in order to make room for a more healthy and natural state of things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It is our duty also to press upon the people the hopelessness of appealing to the <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> bureaucracy to reform itself and the uselessness of any partial measures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>No publicist of the new school holding such views ought to mar his reputation for candour and honesty by the pretence of drawing the attention of Government<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="210" href="#">3</a> with a view to redress the grievance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If the alien laws have declared it illegal for him to do his duty unless he lowers himself by covering it with a futile and obvious lie, he must still do his duty, however illegal, in the strength of his manhood; and if the bureaucracy decide to send him to prison for the breach of law, to prison he must willingly and, if he is worth his salt, rejoicingly go.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The new spirit will not suffer any individual aspiring to speak or act on behalf of the people to palter with the obligation of high truthfulness and unflinching courage without which no one has a claim to lead or instruct his fellow-countrymen.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 941"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>If this penalty of sedition is at present the chief danger which the adherent or exponent of passive resistance runs under the law, yet there is no surety that it will continue to be unaccompanied by similar or more serious perils.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The making of the laws is at present in the hands of our political adversaries and there is nothing to prevent them from using this power in any way they like, however iniquitous or tyrannical,– nothing except their fear of public reprobation outside and national resistance within India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>At present they hope by the seductive allurements of Morleyism to smother the infant strength of the national spirit in its cradle; but as that hope is dissipated and the doctrine of passive resistance takes more and more concrete and organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="211" href="#">4</a> form, the temptation to use the enormously powerful weapon which the unhampered facility of legislation puts in their hands, will become irresistible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The passive resister must therefore take up his creed with the certainty of having to suffer for it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>If, for instance, the bureaucracy should make abstention from Government schools or teaching without Government licence a penal offence, he must continue to abstain or teach and take the legal consequences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Or if they forbid the action of arbitration courts other than those sanctioned by Government, he must yet continue to act on such courts or have recourse to them without considering the peril to which he exposes himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>And </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 290</p>
<p class="PE"> so throughout the whole range of action covered by the new politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>A law imposed by a people on itself has a binding force which cannot be ignored except under extreme necessity: a law imposed from outside has no such moral sanction; its claim to obedience must rest on coercive force or on its own equitable and beneficial character and not on the source from which it proceeds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>If it is unjust and oppressive, it may become a duty to disobey it and quietly endure the punishment which the law has provided for its violation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>For passive resistance aims at making a law unworkable by general and organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="212" href="#">5</a> disobedience and so procuring its recall; it does not try, like aggressive resistance, to destroy the law by destroying the power which made and supports the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It is therefore the first canon of passive resistance that to break an unjust coercive law is not only justifiable but, under given circumstances, a duty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 942"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Legislation, however, is not the only weapon in the hands of the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>They may try, without legislation, by executive action, to bring opposition under the terms of the law and the lash of its penalties.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>This may be done either by twisting a perfectly legal act into a criminal offence or misdemeanour with the aid of the ready perjuries of the police or by executive order or ukase making illegal an action which had previously been allowed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>We have had plenty of experience of both these contrivances during the course of the Swadeshi movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>To persuade an intending purchaser not to buy British cloth is no offence; but if, between a police employed to put down Swadeshi and a shopkeeper injured by it, enough evidence can be concocted to twist persuasion into compulsion, the boycotter can easily be punished without having committed any offence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Executive orders are an even more easily-handled weapon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The issuing of an ukase asks for no more trouble than the penning of a few lines by a clerk and the more or less legible<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="213" href="#">6</a> signature of a District Magistrate; and <i>hey presto</i>! that brief magical abracadabra of despotism has turned an action which five minutes ago was legitimate and inoffensive into a crime or misdemeanour punishable in property or person.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> of all that is most distinguished, able and respected in the country, one stroke of a mere District Magistrate’s omnipotent pen is enough to make them illegalities and turn the elect of the nation into disorderly and riotous budmashes to be dispersed by police cudgels.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>To hope for any legal redress is futile; for the power of the executive to issue ukases is perfectly vague and therefore practically illimitable, and wherever there is a doubt, it can be brought within the one all-sufficient formula,– “It was done by the Magistrate in exercise of the discretion given him for preserving the peace.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The formula can cover any ukase or any action, however arbitrary; and what British Judge can refuse his support to a British Magistrate in that preservation of peace which is as necessary to the authority and safety of the Judge as to that of the Magistrate?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>But equally is it impossible for the representatives of popular aspirations to submit to such paralysing exercise of an irresponsible and unlimited authority.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Executive authority was defied by all Bengal when its representatives, with Babu Surendranath Banerji at their head, escorted their President through the streets of Barisal with the forbidden cry of “Bande Mataram.”<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The second canon of the doctrine of passive resistance has therefore been accepted by politicians of both schools – that to resist an unjust coercive order or interference is not only justifiable but, under given circumstances, a duty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 943"><!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Finally, we must be prepared for opposition not only from our natural but from unnatural adversaries,– not only from bureaucrat and Anglo-Indian, but from the more self-seeking and treacherous of our own countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>In a rebellion such treachery is of small importance, since in the end it is the superior fate or the superior force which triumphs; but in a campaign of passive resistance the evil example, if unpunished, may be disastrous </p>

<p class="PE"> and eat fatally into the enthusiastic passion and serried unity indispensable to such a movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>It is therefore necessary to mete out the heaviest penalty open to us in such cases – the penalty of social excommunication.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>We are not in favour of this weapon being lightly used; but its employment, where the national will in a vital matter is deliberately disregarded, becomes essential.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Such disregard amounts to siding in matters of life and death against your own country and people and helping in their destruction or enslavement,– a crime which in Free States is punished with the extreme penalty due to treason.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>When, for instance, all Bengal staked its future upon the boycott and specified three foreign articles,– salt, sugar and cloth,– as to be religiously avoided, anyone purchasing foreign salt or foreign sugar or foreign cloth became guilty of treason to the nation and laid himself open to the penalty of social boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Wherever passive resistance has been accepted, the necessity of the social boycott has been recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="215" href="#">8</a> as its natural concomitant.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>For without this boycott of persons the boycott of things cannot be effective; without the social boycott no national authority depending purely on moral pressure can get its decrees effectively executed; and without effective boycott enforced by a strong national authority the new policy cannot succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_63"><!-- --></a>But the only possible alternatives to the new policy are either despotism tempered by petitions or aggressive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_64"><!-- --></a>We must therefore admit a third canon of the doctrine of passive resistance, that social boycott is legitimate and indispensable as against persons guilty of treason to the nation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">VI. Its Limits<!--/SENT--></h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 947"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The three canons of the doctrine of passive resistance are in reality three necessities which must, whether we like it or not, be accepted in theory and executed in practice, if passive resistance is to have any chance of success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Passive resisters, both as individuals and in the mass, must always be prepared to break an unjust coercive law and take the legal consequence; for if they shrink from this obligation, the bureaucracy can at once make passive resistance impossible simply by adding a few more enactments to their book of statutes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>A resistance which can so easily be snuffed out of being is not worth making.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>For the same reason they must be prepared to disobey an unjust and coercive executive order, whether general or particular; for nothing would be simpler than to put down by a few months’ coercion a resistance too weak to face the consequences of refusing submission to Government by ukase.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>They must be prepared to boycott persons guilty of deliberate disobedience to the national will in vital matters because, if they do not, the example of unpunished treason will tend to be repeated and destroy by a kind of dry rot the enthusiastic unity and universality which we have seen to be necessary to the success of passive resistance of the kind we have inaugurated in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Men in the mass are strong and capable of wonder-working enthusiasms and irresistible movements; but the individual average man is apt to be weak or selfish and, unless he sees that the mass are in deadly earnest and will not tolerate individual treachery, he will usually after the first enthusiasm indulge his weakness or selfishness to the detriment of the community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We have seen this happening almost everywhere where the boycott of foreign goods was not enforced by the boycott of persons buying foreign goods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This is one important reason why the boycott which has maintained itself in East Bengal, is in the West becoming more and more of a failure.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 294</p>
<p class="PE">The moment these three unavoidable obligations are put into force, the passive resistance movement will lose its character of inoffensive legality and we shall be in the thick of a struggle which may lead us anywhere.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Passive resistance, when it is confined, as at present, to lawful abstention from actions which it lies within our choice as subjects to do or not to do, is of the nature of the strategical movements and large manoeuvrings previous to the meeting of armies in the field; but the enforcement of our three canons brings us to the actual shock of battle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless our resistance still retains an essential character of passivity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>If the right of public meeting is suspended by Magisterial ukase, we confine ourselves to the practical assertion of the right in defiance of the ukase and, so long as the executive also confines itself to the dispersal of the meeting by the arrest of its conveners and other peaceful and legal measures, we offer no active resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We submit to the arrest, though not necessarily to the dispersal, and quietly take the legal consequences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Similarly, if the law forbids us to speak or write the truth as we conceive it our duty to speak it, we persist in doing our duty and submit quietly to whatever punishment the law of sedition or any other law coercive ingenuity may devise, can find to inflict on us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>In a peaceful way we act against the law or the executive, but we passively accept the legal consequences.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 949"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>There is a limit however to passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>So long as the action of the executive is peaceful and within the rules of the fight, the passive resister scrupulously maintains his attitude of passivity, but he is not bound to do so a moment beyond.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>To submit to illegal or violent methods of coercion, to accept outrage and hooliganism as part of the legal procedure of the country is to be guilty of cowardice, and, by dwarfing national manhood, to sin against the divinity within ourselves and the divinity in our motherland.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The moment coercion of this kind is attempted, passive resistance ceases and active resistance becomes a duty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>If the instruments of the executive choose to disperse our meeting by breaking the heads of those present, the right of self-defence entitles us not merely to defend our heads but to retaliate on those of the head-breakers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>For the myrmidons of the law have </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 295</p>
<p class="PE"> ceased then to be guardians of the peace and become breakers of the peace, rioters and not instruments of authority, and their uniform is no longer a bar to the right of self-defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Nor does it make any difference if the instruments of coercion happen to be the recognized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="216" href="#">1</a> and usual instruments or are unofficial hooligans in alliance or sympathy with the forces of coercion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In both cases active resistance becomes a duty and passive resistance is, for that occasion, suspended.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But though no longer passive, it is still a defensive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Nor does resistance pass into the aggressive stage so long as it resists coercive violence in its own kind and confines itself to repelling attack.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Even if it takes the offensive it does not by that mere fact become aggressive resistance, unless the amount of aggression exceeds what is necessary to make defence effective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The students of Mymensingh, charged by the police while picketing, kept well within the right of self-defence when they drove the rioters off the field of operations; the gentlemen of Comilla kept well within the rights of self-defence if they attacked either rioters or inciters of riot who either offered, or threatened, or tried to provoke assault.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Even the famous shot which woke the authorities from their waking dreams, need not have been an act of aggression if it was fired to save life or a woman’s honour or under circumstances of desperation when no other means of defence would have been effective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>With the doubtful exception of this shot, supposing it to have been fired unnecessarily, and that other revolver shot which killed Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Rand, there has been no instance of aggressive resistance in modern Indian politics.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 950"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The new politics, therefore, while it favours passive resistance, does not include meek submission to illegal outrage under that term; it has no intention of overstressing the passivity at the expense of the resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Nor is it inclined to be hysterical over a few dozen of broken heads or exalt so simple a matter as a bloody coxcomb into the crown of martyrdom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>This sort of hysterical exaggeration was too common in the early days of the movement when everyone who got his crown cracked in a street affray with the police was encouraged to lift up his broken head before the world and cry out, “This is the head of a martyr.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 296</p>
<p class="PE"> new politics is a serious doctrine and not, like the old, a thing of shows and political theatricals: it demands real sufferings from its adherents,– imprisonment, worldly ruin, death itself,– before it can allow him to assume the rank of a martyr for his country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Passive resistance cannot build up a strong and great nation unless it is masculine, bold and ardent in its spirit and ready at any moment and at the slightest notice to supplement itself with active resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>We do not want to develop a nation of women who know only how to suffer and not how to strike.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 951"><!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Moreover the new politics must recognise the fact that beyond a certain point passive resistance puts a strain on human endurance which our natures cannot endure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>This may come in particular instances where an outrage is too great or the stress of tyranny too unendurable for anyone to stand purely on the defensive; to hit back, to assail and crush the assailant, to vindicate one’s manhood becomes an imperious necessity to outraged humanity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Or it may come in the mass when the strain of oppression a whole nation has to meet in its unarmed struggle for liberty, overpasses its powers of endurance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It then becomes the sole choice either to break under the strain and go under or to throw it off with violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The Spartan soldiers at Plataea endured for some time the missiles of the enemy and saw their comrades falling at their side without any reply because their general had not yet declared it to be the auspicious time for attack; but if the demand on their passive endurance had been too long continued, they must either have broken in disastrous defeat or flung themselves on the enemy in disregard of their leaders’ orders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The school of politics which we advocate is not based upon abstractions, formulas and dogmas, but on practical necessities and the teaching of political experience, common sense and the world’s history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We have not the slightest wish to put forward passive resistance as an inelastic dogma.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>We preach defensive resistance mainly passive in its methods at present, but active whenever active resistance is needed; but defensive resistance within the limits imposed by human nature and by the demands of self-respect and the militant spirit of true manhood.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>If at any time the laws obtaining in India or the executive action </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 297</p>
<p class="PE"> of the bureaucracy were to become so oppressive as to render a struggle for liberty on the lines we have indicated, impossible; if after a fair trial given to this method, the object with which we undertook it, proved to be as far off as ever; or if passive resistance should turn out either not feasible or necessarily ineffectual under the conditions of this country, we should be the first to recognize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="217" href="#">2</a> that everything must be reconsidered and that the time for new men and new methods had arrived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>We recognize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="218" href="#">3</a> no political object of worship except the divinity in our motherland, no present object of political endeavour except liberty and no method or action as politically good or evil except as it truly helps or hinders our progress towards national emancipation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 955"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>To sum up the conclusions at which we have arrived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The object of all our political movements and therefore the sole object with which we advocate passive resistance is Swaraj or national freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The latest and most venerable of the older politicians who have sat in the Presidential chair of the Congress, pronounced from that seat of authority Swaraj as the one object of our political endeavour, Swaraj as the only remedy for all our ills, Swaraj as the one demand nothing short of which will satisfy the people of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Complete self-government as it exists in the United Kingdom or the Colonies,– such was his definition of Swaraj.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The Congress has contented itself with demanding self-government as it exists in the Colonies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>We of the new school would not pitch our ideal one inch lower than absolute Swaraj,– self-government as it exists in the United Kingdom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We believe that no smaller ideal can inspire national revival or nerve the people of India for the fierce, stubborn and formidable struggle by which alone they can again become a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We believe that this newly awakened people, when it has gathered its strength together, neither can nor ought to consent to any relations with England less than that of equals in a confederacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>To be content with the relations of master and dependent or superior and subordinate, would be a mean and pitiful aspiration unworthy of manhood; to strive for anything less than a strong and glorious freedom would be to insult the greatness of our past and the magnificent possibilities of our future.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 956"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>To the ideal we have at heart there are three paths, possible or impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Petitioning, which we have so long followed, we reject as impossible,– the dream of a timid inexperience, the teaching of false friends who hope to keep us in perpetual subjection, foolish to reason, false to experience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Self-development by self-help which we now purpose to follow, is a possible though </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 299</p>
<p class="PE"> uncertain path, never yet attempted under such difficulties, but one which must be attempted, if for nothing else yet to get free of the habit of dependence and helplessness, and reawaken and exercise our half-atrophied powers of self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Parallel to this attempt and to be practised simultaneously, the policy of organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="219" href="#">1</a> resistance to the present system of government forms the old traditional way of nations which we also must tread.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is a vain dream to suppose that what other nations have won by struggle and battle, by suffering and tears of blood, we shall be allowed to accomplish easily, without terrible sacrifices, merely by spending the ink of the journalist and petition-framer and the breath of the orator.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Petitioning will not bring us one yard nearer to freedom; self-development will not easily be suffered to advance to its goal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>For self-development spells the doom of the ruling bureaucratic despotism, which must therefore oppose our progress with all the art and force of which it is the master: without organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="220" href="#">2</a> resistance we could not take more than a few faltering steps towards self-emancipation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But resistance may be of many kinds,– armed revolt, or aggressive resistance short of armed revolt, or defensive resistance whether passive or active: the circumstances of the country and the nature of the despotism from which it seeks to escape must determine what form of resistance is best justified and most likely to be effective at the time or finally successful.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 957"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The Congress has not formally abandoned the petitioning policy; but it is beginning to fall into discredit and gradual disuse, and time will accelerate its inevitable death by atrophy; for it can no longer even carry the little weight it had, since it has no longer the support of an undivided public opinion at its back.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The alternative policy of self-development has received a partial recognition; it has been made an integral part of our political activities, but not in its entirety and purity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Self-help has been accepted as supplementary to the help of the very bureaucracy which it is our declared object to undermine and supplant,– self-development as supplementary to development of the nation by its foreign rulers.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 958"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This is a compromise good enough for the moment, but in which the new school does not mean to allow the country to rest permanently.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But we would extend the policy of self-development to every department of national life; not only Swadeshi and National Education, but national defence, national Arbitration Courts, sanitation, insurance against famine or relief of famine,– whatever our hands find to do or urgently needs doing, we must attempt ourselves and no longer look to the alien to do it for us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And we would universalize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="222" href="#">4</a> and extend the policy of defensive resistance until it ran parallel on every line with our self-development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>We would not only buy our own goods, but boycott British goods; not only have our own schools, but boycott Government institutions; not only erect our own Arbitration Courts, but boycott bureaucratic justice; not only organize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="223" href="#">5</a> our own league<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="224" href="#">6</a> of defence but have nothing to do with the bureaucratic Executive except when we cannot avoid it.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Old Year</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 994"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>There are periods in the history of the world when the unseen Power that guides its destinies seems to be filled with a consuming passion for change and a strong impatience of the old.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Great Mother, the Adya Shakti, has resolved to take the nations into Her hand and shape them anew.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>These are periods of rapid destruction and energetic creation, filled with the sound of cannon and the trampling of armies, the crash of great downfalls and the turmoil of swift and violent revolutions; the world is thrown into the smelting pot and comes out in a new shape and with new features.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>They are periods when the wisdom of the wise is confounded and the prudence of the prudent turned into a laughing-stock; for it is the day of the prophet, the dreamer, the fanatic and the crusader,– the time of divine revelation when Avatars are born and miracles happen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Such a period was the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth; in such a period we find ourselves at the dawn of this twentieth century, the years of whose infancy have witnessed such wonderful happenings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The result of the earlier disturbance was the birth of a new Europe and the modernisation of the Western world; we are assisting now at the birth of a new Asia and the modernisation of the East.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The current started then from distant America but the centre of disturbance was Western and Central Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>This time there have been three currents,– insurgent nationalism starting from South Africa, Asiatic revival starting from Japan, Eastern democracy starting from Russia; and the centre of disturbance covers a huge zone, all Eastern, Southern and Western Asia, Northern or Asiaticised Africa and Russia which form the semi-Asiatic element in Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>As the pace </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>With the help of Japanese instructors she is training herself quietly in war, and science has made an immense advance in the organisation of a disciplined army, and is now busy laying the foundations of an effective navy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In spite of the arrogant protests of British merchants, she has taken her enormous customs revenue into her own hands for national purposes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>By her successful diplomacy she has deprived England of the fruits of the unscrupulous, piratical attack upon Tibet and is maintaining her hold on that outpost of the Mongolian world.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 996"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Japan during this year has been vigorously pushing on her industrial expansion at home and abroad; she has practically effected the commercial conquest of Manchuria and begun in good earnest the struggle with European trade and her manufactures are invading Europe and America.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Her army reorganisation has been so large and thorough as to make the island Empire invincible in her own sphere of activity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>A little cloud has sprung up between herself and America, but she has conducted herself with her usual <i>sang froid</i>, moderation and calm firmness; and, however far the difficulty may go, we may be sure that she will </p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 997"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In other parts of the Far East there have only been slight indications of coming movements.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The troubles in the Philippines are over and America has restored to the inhabitants a certain measure of self-government, which, if used by the Filipinos with energy and discretion, may be turned into an instrument for the recovery of complete independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Siam has purchased release from humiliating restrictions on her internal sovereignty at the heavy price of a large cession of territory to intruding France; but she is beginning to pay more attention to her naval and military development and it will be well if this means that she has realised the only way to preserve her independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>At present Siam is the one weak point in Mongolian Asia.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Otherwise the events of this year show that by the terrible blow she struck at Russia, Japan has arrested the process of European absorption in the Far East.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 998"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But the most remarkable feature of the past year is the awakening of the Mahomedan world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>In Afghanistan it has seen the inception of a great scheme of National Education which may lay the basis of a State, strong in itself, organised on modern lines and equipped with scientific knowledge and training.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>In Persia the year has brought about a peaceful revolution,– the granting of Parliamentary Government by an Asiatic king to his subjects under the mildest passive pressure and the return of national life to Iran.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>In Egypt it has confronted the usurping rule<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="248" href="#">1</a> of England with a nationalist movement, not only stronger and more instructed than that of Arabi Pasha but led by the rightful sovereign of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The exhibition of cold-blooded British ferocity at Denshawi has defeated its object, and, instead of appalling the Egyptians into submission, made them more determined and united.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It is now only a question of time for this awakening to affect the rest of Islam and check the European as effectually in Western Asia as he has been checked in the East.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>In India too </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 314</p>
<p class="PE"> there has been an immense advance,– an advance so great that we shall not be able to appreciate it properly until its results have worked themselves out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The year began with Barisal; it closes with Comilla.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The growing intensity of the struggle in Eastern Bengal can be measured by this single transition, and its meaning is far deeper than appears on the surface.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It means that the two forces which must contend for the possession of India’s future,– the British bureaucracy and the Indian people,– have at last clashed in actual conflict.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Barisal meant passive, martyr-like endurance; Comilla means active, courageous resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The fighting is at present only on the far eastern fringe of this great country; but it must, as it grows in intensity, spread westwards.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Sparks of the growing conflagration will set fire to Western Bengal, and India is now far too united for the bureaucracy to succeed long in isolating the struggle.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1000"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>The second feature of the year has been the rapid growth of the Nationalist party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>It has in a few months absorbed Eastern Bengal, set Allahabad and the North on fire and is stirring Madras to its depths.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>In Bengal it has become a distinct and recognised force so powerful in its moral influence that petitioning is practically dead and the whole nation stands committed to a policy of self-development and passive resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The Press a few months ago was, with the exception of a few Mahratti<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="249" href="#">2</a> weeklies, one journal in the Punjab and the <i>Sandhya</i> and <i>New India</i> in Calcutta, almost entirely Moderate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The increase of Nationalist journals such as the <i>Balbharat</i> and <i>Andhra Keshari</i> in Madras, the <i>Aftab</i> in the North and ourselves in Calcutta, the appearance of local papers filled with the new spirit, the sudden popularity of a paper like the <i>Yugantar</i> and the extent to which the new ideas are infecting journals not avowedly of the new school, are indices of the rapidity with which Nationalism is formulating itself and taking possession of the country.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1001"><!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>A third feature of the year has been the growth of National Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>The Bengal National College has not only become an established fact but is rapidly increasing in numbers and has begun to build the foundations of a better system of education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The schools at Rungpur<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="250" href="#">3</a> and Dacca already existed at the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 315</p>
<p class="PE"> commencement of the year; but immediately after the Barisal outrage fresh schools at Mymensingh, Kishoregunj, Comilla, Chandpur and Dinajpur were established.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>Since then there have been further additions,– the Magura School, another in the Jessore District, another at Jalpaiguri as well as a free primary school at Bogra<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="251" href="#">4</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>We understand that there is also a probability of a National School at Chittagong and Noakhali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>No mean record for a single year.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>As was to be expected, most of these schools have grown up in the great centre of Nationalism, East Bengal.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1002"><!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Such is the record of Nationalist advance in India in 1313.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>It is a record of steady and rapid growth; and the year closes with the starting of a tremendous issue which may carry us far beyond the stage of mere beginnings and preparations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>Long ago we heard it prophesied that the year 1907 would see the beginning of the actual struggle for national liberty in India.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Bankim divined our need and was inspired to meet it,– he gave us a means by which the soul of Bengal could express itself to itself.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1010"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>As he had divined the linguistic need of his country’s future, so he divined also its political need.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We congratulate Babu Surendranath on his conversion to the New Nationalism, but we are not sure that we can congratulate the New Nationalism on its convert.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Nationalism is, after all, primarily an emotion of the heart and a spiritual attitude and only secondarily an intellectual conviction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Its very foundation is the worship of national liberty as the one political deity and the readiness to consider all things well lost if only freedom is won.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>He wishes to drive bargains with God, to buy liberty from Him in the cheapest market, at the smallest possible price.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Until now he was the leader of those who desired to reach a qualified liberty by safe and comfortable means.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>He is now for an unqualified liberty; and since the way to absolute liberty cannot be perfectly safe and comfortable, he wants to make it as safe and comfortable as he can.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>“There is no limit to what they can do.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The federation of humanity is one of those sounding phrases, dear to Babu Surendranath, which have no relation to actualities; but the rightful place of India among the nations, federated or unfederated, is one which cannot admit of any the least restriction on her liberty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>And the description of the methods to be used at least rules petitioning out of court; for petitioning is certainly wasteful in its nature and would not bring us soonest,– nor, indeed, at all – to our assured destination.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is true that the writer in the next breath says, “We have no quarrel with anybody who does not stand in our way” – an obvious truism,– and invites the Government “not to block the way”, promising it as a reward “a happy and not inglorious transformation at no distant date”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But the bureaucracy knows, as well as the writer knows, that transformation is only an euphemism for translation to a better world, and there is not the slightest chance of its listening to this bland invitation.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1053"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately the rest of the article is devoted to carefully undoing the effect of the first half.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It is practically an attempt to controvert the position which we have taken up in this journal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Our position is that it is imperatively necessary for this nation to enter into an immediate struggle for national liberty which we must win at any cost; that in this struggle we must be inspired and guided by the teachings of history and those glorious examples which show how even nations degraded, enslaved and internally disunited, can rapidly attain to freedom and unity; and that for this purpose the great necessity is to awake in the nation a burning, an irresistible, an unanimous will, to be free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> denies all these positions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>We must win liberty, it holds, not by an immediate struggle but by a long and weary journey; not by heavy sacrifices, but in the spirit of a Banya by grudging, limited and carefully-calculated sacrifices.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>We are not to be guided by the concrete lessons of history, but by vague and intangible rhetorical generalisations about “our increased knowledge and wisdom, our enlarged affections and interests of the present day”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We are to curb our will to be free by a “trained intelligence” which teaches us that we are not a homogenous nation and must therefore tolerate differences.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1054"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>We will content ourselves at present with pointing out that the <i>Bengalee</i>’s answer to us is neither objective nor self-consistent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>We have tried to establish our position by definite arguments and appeals to well-known facts of human nature and human experience; the <i> Bengalee</i> simply denies our conclusions in general terms without advancing a single definite argument.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We can only conclude that our contemporary has no definite arguments to advance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The confusion of his ideas is appalling.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>We are to choose for the attainment of liberty the method which will bring us soonest to our destination; but we must at the same time insist on making it a long and weary journey.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We must have the determination to get liberty “at any cost”; but we must not carry out that determination in practice; no, in practice we must get it not at any cost but at the smallest cost possible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 334</p>
<p class="PE"> We must really ask the <i>Bengalee</i> to clear up this tangle of ideas and discover some definite arguments before it again asks the Nationalists to confine themselves to realising their ideas in practice and to abstain from “quarrelling with everybody who differs from them”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>It would be no doubt very gratifying to the <i>Bengalee</i> not to be quarrelled with, in other words, to escape from the annoyance of finding its intellectual positions and its methods assailed; but we cannot gratify it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>So far as possible, our ideas are being realised in practice wherever Nationalism is strong; but for their full effectiveness they need the whole nation at their back and it is therefore our first duty to convince the nation by exposing pseudo-Nationalism in all its workings.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>This veteran leader is a declared opportunist, who believes, as he has himself said, in expediency more than in principles.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Well and good; but even an opportunist leader must keep pace with public opinion, if he does not even go half a step in front of it; he must know which way it is going to leap before the leap is taken, and not follow halting some paces behind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The nation moves forward with rapidity; Babu Surendranath pants ineffectually after it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The most disgraceful feature of the riots has been the conduct of the British local official who seems to have deceived and betrayed the Hindus into the hands of the Mahomedan <i>goondas</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The nature of the attack, its suddenness and completeness, show beyond doubt that it had been carefully planned beforehand and was no casual outbreak either of fanaticism or rowdyism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>It is impossible to believe that the Joint Magistrate, responsible for the peace of the country, was totally uninformed of the likelihood of an organised attack which was generally apprehended by the Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Yet it is reported that the local official induced the Hindus to be present at the <i>mela</i> by a distinct pledge that they had nothing to fear from the Mahomedans, and then, in violation of his pledge, left them utterly unprotected for brutality and sacrilege to work their will upon them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>If he had any inkling of the outbreak which was then in preparation, his action amounted to cynical treachery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Even if he was so imbecile as to be unaware of what was going on in his own jurisdiction, his failure to provide against the possibility of his pledge coming to nothing lays him open to the worst constructions.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We can only conclude therefore that, as at Comilla, the local officials looked with sympathy on the rioters as allies in the repression of Swadeshism, and acted accordingly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>To stand by while the Mahomedans carry out that violent repression of Swadeshism which the sham Liberalism of the present Government policy forbids them to undertake themselves; to clinch this illegal repression by legal repression in the form of prosecution of respectable Hindus for the crime of self-defence; to strain every nerve to prevent outside help coming to the distressed and maltreated Swadeshists, and finally to save appearances by sending a few of the Mahomedan rioters to prison – a punishment which has no terrors for them, since they are all hooligans and some of them old jailbirds: – such has been the consistent attitude of the local officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The only new circumstance in the Jamalpur incident has been the assurance given by the local official which amounted to a promise of protection and which alone made the outrage possible.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Graduated Boycott</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1099"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The opponents of the new spirit have discovered that boycott is an illusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>An entire and sweeping boycott, they say, is a moral and physical impossibility; and their infallible economic authority, Mr. Gokhale, has found out that a graduated boycott is an economic impossibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>They point to the failure of the thorough-going boycott in Bengal as a proof of the first assertion; the second, they think, requires no proof, for how can what Mr. Gokhale has said be wrong?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>This assertion of the impossibility of a graduated boycott is an answer to the reasoning by which Mr. Tilak has supported the movement in Maharashtra.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In the first days of the movement Mr. Tilak published a series of vigorous and thoughtful articles in the <i>Kesari</i> on boycott as a political Yoga.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>He advocated the entire exclusion of British goods, the preference of Swadeshi goods at a sacrifice when they were attainable, and, when unattainable, the preference of any foreign goods not produced in the British Empire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>To the argument that this programme was not immediately practicable in its completeness, he replied that as in Yoga, so in the boycott, “even a little of this <i>dharma</i> saves us from a mighty peril”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The mighty peril is the entire starvation of the country by foreign exploiters and its complete and hopeless dependence on aliens for almost all articles of common use.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Even a slight immediate diminution of this dependence would be a great national gain and could by degrees be extended until the full boycott policy became an accomplished fact.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak, with his shrewd practical insight, was able to see clearly that immediate and complete success of a thorough-going boycott was not possible in India but that a gradually efficacious boycott would naturally result from a </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 350</p>
<p class="PE"> thorough-going boycott campaign.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>What Mr. Tilak foresaw, is precisely what is happening.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1100"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The entire exclusion of British-made goods is the political aspect of the Boycott with which we do not deal in this article.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Is it a fact that as an economic weapon a graduated boycott is impossible?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Boycott may be graduated in several ways.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>First, by the gradual growth of the idea of excluding foreign goods a steadily increasing check may be put on the import of particular foreign articles and a corresponding impulse given to the use of the same articles produced in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>A Government by imposing a gradually increasing duty on an import in successive tariffs, may kill it by degrees instead of immediately imposing a prohibitive rate; the growth of the boycott sentiment may automatically exercise the same kind of increasing check.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The growth of the sentiment will help on the production of the indigenous article and the increased production of the indigenous article will help on the growth of the sentiment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Thus mutually stimulated, Swadeshi and boycott will advance with equal and ever more rapid steps, until the shrinkage of the foreign import reaches the point where it is no longer profitable to import it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The process can only be checked by insufficiency<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="282" href="#">1</a> of capital in the country available or willing to invest itself in Swadeshi manufacture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>But the growth of the boycott sentiment will of itself encourage and is encouraging capital to invest in this direction; for so much boycott means so much <i>sure market</i> for the Swadeshi<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="283" href="#">2</a> article<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="284" href="#">3</a> and therefore an increase of capital willing to invest in Swadeshi manufacture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The increased production of the Swadeshi article in its turn means more money in the hands of the mercantile class and of investors in Swadeshi Companies and therefore more capital <i>available</i> for investment in Swadeshi manufacture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>We fail to see how in this sense an automatically graduated boycott is impossible; on the contrary, it seems to us economically inevitable, provided only the boycott sentiment is increasingly embraced by the people.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1101"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Boycott may be graduated in another way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>When the boycott was declared in Bengal, it was declared specially against cloth, sugar and salt and only generally against other articles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 351</p>
<p class="PE"> It is therefore the imports of English piece-goods, Liverpool salt and, though only to a slight extent, of foreign sugar into Bengal which have suffered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>When this specific boycott has been proved effective, it may be extended to other articles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Thus the boycott may be graduated not only in its incidence on particular articles, but in its extent and range.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The graduation of a specific boycott may be partly artificial and partly automatic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is artificial when the leaders of the people preach an economic <i>jehad</i> against particular foreign goods and the people accept their decision.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But this artificial boycott can only succeed when there is already an incipient industry in the corresponding Swadeshi article or some existing means of supply however partial, which may be stimulated or extended by the boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Liverpool salt has been affected because ‘Karkach’ is available; British piece-goods have been affected because there was already a mill industry and a handloom industry which have been enormously stimulated by the boycott, as is shown by the wholesale return of the weaver class to their trade in Bengal and by the increase in the number of weaving mills and the splendid dividends which the existing concerns are paying.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>On the other hand the campaign against foreign sugar has not been successful because the proper substitute is not available.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Yarns have not been affected because the spinning industry in India is a negligible quantity while the demand for yarn has enormously increased.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>In time a <i>jehad</i> against foreign yarn will become feasible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But the specific boycott may also be automatic when the general sentiment of boycott attacks a particular article for which a substitute exists in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>To take a small instance, the market for steel trunks sent ready-manufactured from England is decreasing to such an extent that failures of dealers in steel trunks are beginning to be recorded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Here again, we fail to see the impossibility of a graduated boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>It is quite true that in the very beginning the increase of the stimulated Swadeshi article may not be sufficient to blot out entirely the increase in the import, and the superficial and hasty may proclaim the failure of the boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But by the growth of the boycott the increase of the Swadeshi article must progressively swell and the increase of the import must <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> progressively shrink until it is turned into an actual decrease.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The fact that the success of the boycott is progressive and not miraculous, need not frighten or disappoint any sensible and determined boycotter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is true also that the growth of Swadeshi may actually stimulate for a time the import of particular foreign articles, such as machinery or yarns; but the stimulation is temporary and, as soon as part of our growing capital is free and willing to invest in new fields, the graduated boycott will naturally extend itself in these directions sooner than in others.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1102"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The theory therefore that a graduated boycott is impossible, seems to us to have no foundation either of facts or of reasoning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Whatever the fate of its use as a political weapon, its success as an economical weapon depends solely on the zeal with which it is preached and the readiness with which it is received by the people.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The ultra-loyalist publicists especially, Indian or Anglo-Indian, are obliged to ignore the true position of the party, misnamed Extremists, because they are unable to meet its trenchant and irresistible logic and commonsense.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The political teaching of the new school is so novel and disturbing to their settled political ideas,– or rather the conventional, abstract, secondhand formulas which take the place of ideas – that they cannot even grasp its true nature and turn from it with repugnance before they have given themselves time to understand it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The most obstinate of these misapprehensions is the idea that the new politics is a counsel of despair, a mad revolutionary fury induced by Curzonian reaction.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>A foreign domination<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="290" href="#">1</a> is in itself an unnatural condition, and if permitted, must bring about other unhealthy and unnatural conditions in the subject people which will lead to fatal decay and disorganisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Foreign rule cannot build up a nation,– only the resistance to foreign rule can weld the discordant elements of a people into an indivisible unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>When a people, predestined to unity, cannot accomplish its destiny, foreign rule is a provision of Nature by which the necessary compelling pressure is applied to drive its jarring parts into concord.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The unnatural condition of foreign rule is brought in for a time in order to cure the previous unnatural condition of insufficient cohesiveness; but this can only be done by the resistance of the subject people; for the incentive to unity given by the alien domination consists precisely in the desire to get rid of it; and if this desire is absent, if the people acquiesce, there can be no force making for unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Foreign rule was therefore made to be resisted; and to acquiesce in it is to defeat the very intention with which Nature created it.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1118"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>These considerations are not abstract ideas, but the undeniable teaching of history which is the record of the world’s experience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Nationalism takes its stand upon this experience and calls upon the people of India not to allow themselves to fall into the acquiescence in subjection which is the death-sleep of nations, but to make that use of the alien domination which Nature intended,– to struggle against it and throw it off for unity, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 358</p>
<p class="PE"> for self-realisation as an independent national organism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>In this country, however, there is a class of wise men who regard the rule of the British bureaucracy as a dispensation of Providence, not only to create unity but to preserve it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>They preach therefore a gospel of faith in the foreigner, distrust of our countrymen and acquiescence in alien rule as a godsend from on high and an indispensable condition for peace and prosperity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Even those whose hearts rebel against a doctrine so servile, are intellectually so much dominated by it that they cannot embrace Nationalism with their whole heart and try to arrive at a compromise between subjection and independence,– a half-way house between life and death.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Their ingenuity discovers an intermediate condition in which the blessings of freedom will be harmoniously wedded with the blessings of subjection; and to this palace in fairyland they have given the name of Colonial Self-Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>If it were not for the existence of this Moderate opinion and its strange particoloured delusions we would not have thought it worth while to go back to first principles and show the falsity of the Loyalist gospel of acquiescence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But the Moderate delusion is really a by-product of the Loyalist delusion; and the parent error must be demolished first, before its offspring can be corrected.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The Moderates are a hybrid species, emotionally Nationalist, intellectually Loyalist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It is owing to this double nature that their delusions acquire an infinite power for mischief.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>People listen to them because they claim to be Nationalist and because a sincere Nationalist feeling not infrequently breaks through the false Loyalist reasoning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Moreover by associating themselves with the Moderates on the same platform the Loyalists are enabled to exercise an influence on public opinion which would otherwise not be accorded to them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The gospel according to Sir Pherozshah Mehta would not have such power for harm if it were not allowed to represent itself as one and the same with the gospel according to Mr. Gokhale.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1119"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>What then are the original ideas from which the Loyalist gospel proceeds?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It has a triple foundation of error.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>First comes the postulate that disunion and weakness are ingrained characteristics of the Indian people and an outside power is necessary </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 359</p>
<p class="PE"> in order to arbitrate, to keep the peace and to protect the country from the menace of the mightier nations that ring us in.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Proceeding from this view and supporting it, is the second postulate that there must be an entire levelling down and sweeping away of all differences; aristocrat and peasant, Brahmin and Sudra, Bengali, Punjabi<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="291" href="#">2</a> and Mahratta<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="292" href="#">3</a>, all must efface their characteristics and differences before any resistance to foreign domination can be attempted, even if such resistance were desirable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The third postulate is that a healthy development is possible under foreign domination and that this healthy development must be first effected before we can dream of freedom or even of becoming a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>If these three postulates are granted, then the Loyalist creed is unassailable; if they are proved unsound, not only the Loyalist creed but the standpoint of the Moderates ceases to have any basis of firm ground and becomes a thing in the air.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Nationalist contention is that all these three postulates are monuments of political unreason and have no firm foundation either in historical experience or in the facts we see around us or in the nature of things.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>They are inconsistent with the fundamental nature of foreign domination; they ignore the experience of all other subject nations; they disregard human nature and the conditions of human development in communities.<!--/SENT-->

<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->National Development and Foreign Rule</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1127"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>In dealing with the Loyalist creed it will be convenient to examine first the general postulate before we can come to those which apply particularly to the conditions of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The contention is that a healthy development is possible under foreign domination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In this view national independence is a thing of no moment or at least its importance has been grossly exaggerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Nations can very well do without it; provided they have a good government which keeps the people happy and contented and allows them to develop their economic activities and moral virtues, they need not repine at being ruled by others.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>For certain nations in certain periods of their development liberty would be disastrous and subjection to foreign rule is the most healthy condition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>India, argue the Loyalists, is an example of such a nation in such a period.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The first business of its people is to develop their commerce, become educated and enlightened, reform their society and their manners and so<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="294" href="#">1</a> grow more and more fit for self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In proportion as they become more civilised and more fit, they will receive from their sympathetic, just and discerning rulers an ever-increasing share in the administration of the country until with entire fitness will come entire possession of the status of British citizenship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The idea is that foreign rule is a Providential dispensation or a provision of Nature for training an imperfectly developed people in the methods of civilisation and the arts of self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>This theory is a modern invention.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Ancient and mediaeval Imperialism frankly acknowledged the principle of might is right; the conquering nation considered that </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 362</p>
<p class="PE"> its military superiority was in itself a proof that it was meant to rule and the subject nation to obey; liberty, being denied by Providence to the latter, could not be good for it and there was no call on the ruler to concede it either now or hereafter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This was the spirit in which England conquered and governed Ireland by the same methods of cynical treachery and ruthless massacre which in modern times are usually considered to be the monopoly of despotisms like Turkey and Russia.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But by the time that England had fastened its hold on India, a change had come over the modern world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Greek ideas of freedom and democracy had penetrated the European mind and created the great impulse of democratic Nationalism which dominated Europe in the nineteenth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The idea that despotism of any kind was an offence against humanity, had crystallised into an instinctive feeling, and modern morality and sentiment revolted against the enslavement of nation by nation, of class by class or of man by man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Imperialism had to justify itself to this modern sentiment and could only do so by pretending to be a trustee of liberty, commissioned from on high to civilise the uncivilised and train the untrained until the time had come when the benevolent conqueror had done his work and could unselfishly retire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Such were the professions with which England justified her usurpation of the heritage of the Moghul and dazzled us into acquiescence in servitude by the splendour of her uprightness and generosity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Such was the pretence with which she veiled her annexation of Egypt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>These Pharisaic pretensions were especially necessary to British Imperialism because in England the Puritanic middle class had risen to power and imparted to the English temperament a sanctimonious self-righteousness which refused to indulge in injustice and selfish spoliation except under a cloak of virtue, benevolence and unselfish altruism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The genesis of the Loyalist gospel can be found in the need of British Imperialism to justify itself to the liberalised sentiment of the nineteenth century and to the Puritanic middle-class element in the British nation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1128"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The question then arises, has this theory any firmer root?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Is it anything more than a convenient theory?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Has it any relations </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 363</p>
<p class="PE"> with actual facts or with human experience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>To answer this question it is necessary to distinguish between three kinds of liberty, which are generally confused together.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>There is a national liberty or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="295" href="#">2</a> freedom from foreign control; there is an internal liberty or that freedom from the despotism of an individual, a class or a combination of classes to which the name of self-government is properly given; and there is individual liberty or the freedom of the individual from unnecessary and arbitrary restrictions imposed on him either by the society of which he is a part or by the Government, whether that Government be monarchical, democratic, oligarchic or bureaucratic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The question at issue is, then, which, if any, of these three kinds of liberty is essential to the healthy development of national life; or can there be such development without any liberty at all?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1129"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The object of national existence, of the formation of men into groups and their tacit agreement to allow themselves to be ruled by an organised instrument of administration which is called the Government, is nothing else than human development in the individual and in the group.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The individual, standing alone, cannot develop; he depends on the support and assistance of the group to which he belongs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The group itself cannot develop unless it has an organisation by means of which it not only secures internal peace and order and protection from external attack but also proper conditions which will give free play for the development of its activities and capacities – physical, moral, intellectual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The nation or group is not like the individual who can specialise his development and throw all his energies into one line.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The nation must develop military and political greatness and activity, intellectual and aesthetic greatness and activity, commercial greatness and activity, moral sanity and vigour; it cannot sacrifice any of these functions of the organism without making itself unfit for the struggle for life and finally succumbing and perishing under the pressure of more highly organised nations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The purely commercial State like Carthage is broken in the shock with a nation which has developed the military and political as well as the commercial energies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>A purely military state like Sparta cannot stand against </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 364</p>
<p class="PE"> rivals which to equal military efficiency unite a greater science, intellectual energy and political ability.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>A purely aesthetic and intellectual state like the Greek colonies in Italy or a purely moral and spiritual community like the empire of Peru are blotted out of existence in the clash with ruder but more vigorous and many-sided organisms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>No Government, therefore, can really be good for a nation or serve the purposes of national life and development which does not give full scope for the development of all the national activities, capacities and energies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Foreign rule is unnatural and fatal to a nation precisely because by its very nature it throws itself upon these activities and capacities and crushes them down in the interests of its own continued existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Even when it does not crush them down violently, it obstructs their growth passively by its very presence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The subject nation becomes dependent, disorganised and loses its powers by atrophy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>For this reason national independence is absolutely necessary to national growth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>There can be no national development without national liberty.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1130"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Individual liberty is necessary to national development, because, if the individual is unduly hampered, the richness of national life suffers and is impoverished.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>The dominant classes may undoubtedly show a splendid development and may make the nation great and famous in history; but when all is said the strength of the nation is then only the sum of the strength of a few privileged classes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The great weakness of India in the past has been the political depression and nullity of the mass of the population.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>It was not from the people of India that India was won by Moghul or Briton, but from a small privileged class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>On the other hand the strength and success of the Marathas and Sikhs in the eighteenth century was due to the policy of Shivaji and Guru Govind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="296" href="#">3</a> which called the whole nation into the fighting line.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>They failed only because the Marathas could not preserve the cohesion which Shivaji gave to their national strength or the Sikhs the discipline which Guru Govind<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="297" href="#">4</a> gave to the Khalsa.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>Is it credible that a foreign rule would either knowingly foster or allow the growth of that universal political consciousness in the subject nation which self-government implies?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>It is obvious that foreign rule can only endure so long as political consciousness can be either stifled by violence or hypnotised into inactivity.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1135"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We are arguing the impossibility of a healthy national development under foreign rule,– except by reaction against that rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The foreign domination naturally interferes with and obstructs the functioning of the native organs of development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is therefore in itself an unnatural and unhealthy condition, a wound, a disease, which must result, unless arrested, in the mortification and rotting to death of the indigenous body politic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If a nation were an artificial product which could be made, then it might be possible for one nation to make another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But a nation cannot be made,– it is an organism which grows under the stress of a principle of life within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We speak indeed of nation-building and of the makers of a nation, but these are only convenient metaphors.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The nation-builder, Cavour or Bismarck, is merely the incarnation of a national force which has found its hour and its opportunity, of an inner will which has awakened under the stress of shaping circumstances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>A nation is, indeed, the outward expression of a community of sentiment, whether it be the sentiment of a common blood or the sentiment of a common religion or the sentiment of a common interest or any or all of these sentiments combined.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Once this sentiment grows strong enough to develop into a will towards unity and to conquer obstacles and make full use of favouring circumstances, the development of the nation becomes inevitable and there is no power which can ultimately triumph against it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But the process, however rapid it may be, is one of growth and not of manufacture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The first impulse of the developing nation is to provide itself with a centre, a means of self-expression and united action<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="299" href="#">1</a>, a chief organ or national nerve-centre with subsidiary organs acting </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 368</p>
<p class="PE"> under and in harmony with it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>If the need of self-protection is its first overpowering need, the organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="300" href="#">2</a> may be military or semi-military under a single chief or a warlike ruling class; if the pressure from outside is not overpowering or the need of internal development strongly felt, it may take the shape of some form of partial or complete self-government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>In either case the community becomes a nation or organic State.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1136"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>What, then, is the place of foreign rule in such an organic development?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The invasion of the body politic by a foreign element must result either in the merging of the alien into the indigenous nationality or in his superimposition on the latter in a precarious position which can only be maintained by coercion or by hypnotizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="301" href="#">3</a> the subject people into passivity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If the alien and the native-born population are akin in blood and in religion, the fusion will be easy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Even if they are not, yet if the former settles down in the conquered country and makes it his motherland, community of interests will in the end inevitably bring about union.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The foreigners become sons of the country by adoption and the sentiment of a common motherland is always a sufficient substitute for the sentiment of a common race-origin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The difficulty of religion may be solved by the conversion of the foreigner to the religion of the people he has conquered, as happened with the ancient invaders of India, or by the conversion of the conquered people to the religion of their rulers, as happened in Persia and other countries conquered by the Arabs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Even if no such general change of creed can be effected, yet the two religions may become habituated to each other and mutually tolerant, or the sentiment of a common interest and a common sonhood of one motherland may overcome the consciousness of religious differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>In all these contingencies there is a fusion, complete or partial; and the nation, though it may be profoundly affected for good or evil, need not be disorganized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="302" href="#">4</a> or lose the power of development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>India under Mahomedan rule, though greatly disturbed and thrown into continual ferment and revolution, did not lose its power of organic readjustment and development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Even the final anarchy which preceded the British domination, was not a process of disorganization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="303" href="#">5</a> but an acute crisis,– the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 369</p>
<p class="PE"> attempt of Nature to effect an organic readjustment in the body politic.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1137"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately the crisis was complicated by the presence and final domination of a foreign body, foreign in blood, foreign in religion, foreign in interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>This body remains superimposed on the native-born population without any roots in the soil.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Its presence, so long as it is neither merged in the nation nor dislodged, must make for the disorganization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="304" href="#">6</a> and decay of the subject people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>It is possible for a foreign body differing in blood, religion and interest, to amalgamate with the native organism but only on one of two conditions; either the foreign body must cut itself off from its origin and take up its home in the conquered country,– a course which is obviously impossible in the present problem,– or it must assimilate the subject State into the paramount State by the removal of all differences, inequalities, and conflicting interests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>We shall point out the insuperable difficulties in the way of any such arrangement which will at once preserve British supremacy and give a free scope to Indian national development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>At present there is no likelihood of the intruding force submitting easily to the immense sacrifices which such an assimilation would involve.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Yet if no such assimilation takes place, the position of the British bureaucracy in India in no way differs from the position of the Turkish despotism as it existed with regard to the Christian populations of the Balkans previous to their independence or of the Austrians in Lombardy before the Italian Revolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It is a position which endangers, demoralizes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="305" href="#">7</a> and eventually weakens the ruling nation as Austria and Turkey were demoralized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="306" href="#">8</a> and weakened, and which disorganizes<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="307" href="#">9</a> and degrades the subject people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>A very brief consideration of the effects of British rule in India will carry this truth home.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>To mix it up with politics in which men of all religious views and various social opinions can join is to confuse issues hopelessly.<!--/SENT-->

<h2 class="sub-hd"><!--SENT-->Unity and British Rule</h2>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1149"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is a common cry in this country that we should effect the unity of its people before we try to be free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>There is no cry which is more plausible, none which is more hollow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>What is it that we mean when we talk of the necessity of unity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Unity does not mean uniformity and the removal of all differences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>There are some people who talk as if unity in religion, for instance, could not be accomplished except by uniformity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But uniformity of religion is a psychical impossibility forbidden by the very nature of the human mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>So long as men differ in intellect, in temperament, in spiritual development, there must be different religions and different sects of the same religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Brahmo Samaj was set on foot in India by Rammohan Roy with the belief that this would be the one religion of India which would replace and unite the innumerable sects now dividing our spiritual consciousness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But in a short time this uniting religion was itself rent into three discordant sects, two of which show signs of internal fissure even within their narrow limits; and all these divisions rest not on anything essential but on differences of intellectual constitution, variety of temperament, divergence of the lines of spiritual development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The unity of the Hindu religion cannot be attained by the destruction of the present sects and the substitution of a religion based on the common truths of Hinduism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It can only be effected if there is, first, a common feeling that the sectarian differences are of subordinate importance compared with the community of spiritual truths and discipline as distinct from the spiritual truths and discipline </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 373</p>
<p class="PE"> of other religions, and, secondly, a common agreement in valuing and cherishing the Hindu religion in its entirety as a sacred and inalienable possession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This is what fundamentally constitutes the sentiment of unity, whether it be religious, political or social.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>There must be the sense of a community in something dear and precious which others do not possess; there must be an acute sense of difference from other communities which have no share in our common possession; there must be a supreme determination to cherish, assert and preserve our common possession from disparagement and destruction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But the sentiment of unity is not sufficient to create unity; we require also the practice of unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Where the sentiment of unity exists and the practice does not, the latter can only be acquired by a common effort to accomplish one great, common and all-absorbing object.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1150"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The first question we have to answer is,– can this practical unity be accomplished by acquiescence in foreign rule?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Certainly, under foreign rule a peculiar kind of uniformity of condition is attained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Brahmin and Sudra, aristocrat and peasant, Hindu and Mahomedan, all are brought to a certain level of equality by equal inferiority to the ruling class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The differences between them are trifling compared with the enormous difference between all of them and the white race at the top.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But this uniformity is of no value for the purposes of national unity, except in so far as the sense of a common inferiority excites a common desire to revolt against and get rid of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If the foreign superiority is acquiesced in, the result is that the mind becomes taken up with the minor differences and instead of getting nearer to unity disunion is exaggerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This is precisely what has happened in India under British rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The sentiment of unity has grown, but in practice we are both socially and politically far more disunited and disorganized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="310" href="#">1</a> than before the British occupation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>In the anarchy that followed the decline of the Moghul, the struggle was between the peoples of various localities scrambling for the inheritance of Akbar and Shahjahan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This was not a vital and permanent element of disunion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But the present disorganisation is internal and therefore more likely to reach the vitals of the community.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1151"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This disorganisation is the natural and inevitable result of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 374</p>
<p class="PE"> foreign rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>A state which is created by a common descent, real or fictitious, by a common religion or by common interests welding together into one a great number of men or group of men, is a natural organism which so long as it exists has always within it the natural power of revival and development.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But as political science has pointed out, a state created by the encampment of a foreign race among a conquered population and supported in the last resort not by any section of the people but by external force, is an inorganic state.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The subject population, it has been said, inevitably becomes a disorganised crowd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Consciously or unconsciously the tendency of the intruding body is to break down all the existing organs of national life and to engross all power in itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The Moghul rule had not this tendency because it immediately naturalised itself in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>British rule has and is forced to have this tendency because it must persist in being an external and intruding presence encamped in the country and not belonging to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It is doubtful whether there is any example in history of an alien domination which has been so monstrously ubiquitous, inquisitorial and intolerant of any centre of strength in the country other than itself as the British bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>There were three actual centres of organised strength in pre-British India,– the supreme ruler, Peshwa or Raja or Nawab reposing his strength on the Zamindars<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="311" href="#">2</a> or Jagirdars; the Zamindar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="312" href="#">3</a> in his own domain reposing his strength on his retinue and tenants; and the village community independent and self-existent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The first result of the British occupation was to reduce to a nullity the supreme ruler, and this was often done, as in Bengal, by the help of the Zamindars<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="313" href="#">4</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The next result was the disorganisation of the village community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The third was the steady breaking-up of the power of the Zamindars<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="314" href="#">5</a> with the help of a new class which the foreigners created for their own purposes,– the bourgeois or middle class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately for the British bureaucracy it had, in order to get the support and assistance of the middle class, to pamper the latter and allow it to grow into a strength and develop organs of its own, such as the Press, the Bar, the University, the Municipalities, District Boards, etc.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Finally, the situation with which British statesmen had to deal was this: – <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> the natural sovereigns of the land helpless and disorganised, the landed aristocracy helpless and disorganised, the peasantry helpless and disorganised, but a middle class growing in strength, pretensions and organisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>British statesmanship, following the instinctive and inevitable trend of an alien domination, set about breaking down the power it had established in order to destroy the sole remaining centre of national strength and possible revival.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>If this could be done, if the middle class could be either tamed, bribed or limited in its expansion, the disorganisation would be complete.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Nothing would be left of the people of India except a disorganised crowd with no centre of strength or means of resistance.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1152"><!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It was in Bengal that the middle class was most developed and self-conscious; and it was in Bengal therefore that a quick succession of shrewd and dangerous blows was dealt at the once useful but now obnoxious class.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>It was now sought to cripple the organs through which this strength was beginning slowly to feel and develop its organic life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The Press was intimidated, the Municipalities officialised, the University officialised and its expansion limited.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Finally the Partition sought with one blow to kill the poor remnants of the Zamindar’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="315" href="#">6</a> power and influence<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="316" href="#">7</a> and to weaken the middle class of Bengal by dividing it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>The suppression of the middle class was the recognised policy of Lord Curzon.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1158"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i>, excited by the news of a second outrage on the Hindu religion at Ambariya in Mymensingh, came out yesterday with a frankly extremist issue.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, what it says is true, and it is well and pointedly expressed: –<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1159"><!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>“Fifty years ago, such a revolting outrage, committed upon the religious susceptibilities of Hindus, would have resulted in grave complications and the Government<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="317" href="#">1</a> would have left no stone unturned to propitiate the Hindu Chiefs and the Hindu population, and last, though not the least, the Hindu section of the Native Army.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Today Government officials openly side, presumably with the approval of the head of the Provincial Administration, with those who break Hindu images, desecrate Hindu temples, plunder the houses and shops of Hindus and ravish Hindu women.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1160"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>“Is this the sum total of our progress after a century and a half of British rule?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Have we, Bengali Hindus, become so craven-hearted, so utterly incapable of self-defence, that the Government no longer thinks it necessary to avoid wounding our tenderest feelings or even to keep up appearances?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Verily, a nation gets precisely the kind of treatment it deserves; and it appears that in the opinion of Mr. Hare – so far tacitly endorsed by Lord Minto – a nation of weeping and shrieking women as the Bengalis are regarded by their rulers, deserves only to be trampled underfoot.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>All this is surprising enough in a Moderate organ; if set before anyone without any clue as to its source, it might all be taken as a verbatim extract from the editorial columns of the <i>Bande Mataram</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Has it taken our contemporary so long to discover that foreign rule, and especially such a rule as that of the British bureaucracy which demands entire subordination and dependence in the subject people, can have no other effect than to emasculate and degrade?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Loyalists may enumerate a hundred blessings of British rule – though, when closely looked at, they turn out to be apples of the Dead Sea which turn to dust and cinders when tasted,– none of them can compensate for the one radical and indispensable loss which accompanies them, the loss of our manhood, of our courage, of our self-respect and habit of initiative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>When these are gone, merely the shadow of a man is left; and neither the veneer of Western culture, nor enlightenment, nor position, nor British peace, nor railways, nor telegraphs, nor anything else that God can give or man bestow can compensate for the loss of the very basis of individual and national strength and character.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1163"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> in these fiery paragraphs denounces for the moment prudence and moderation as mere weakness and cowardice.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>This is probably no more than a rhetorical outburst to relieve overcharged feelings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But if there is any seriousness at all in our contemporary’s wrath, let him seriously consider what his appeal means.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We are to rush to the defence of our temples, our holy images, the honour of our women.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Not surely the people of Eastern Bengal and Northern Bengal, who, outnumbered, overwhelmed, are struggling against overwhelming odds, and, in spite of weak points like Jamalpur, are not acquitting themselves ill.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>In West Bengal the Hindus are in overwhelming majority; in West Bengal there is a sturdy Hindu lower class; there are thousands of students who throng to Swadeshi meetings and parade at Swadeshi jatras and festivals.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>If the most Radical of Radical Secretaries condemned us to age-long subjection to a paternal and absolute bureaucracy, we whispered to the people, “Wait, wait; Britain, the true Britain, the generous, the benevolent, the lover and giver<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="318" href="#">1</a> of freedom, is only sleeping; she shall awake again and we shall see her angelic and transfigured beauty.”<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>That was the dream; and so deeply had it lodged in our imaginations that not only the professed Loyalists, the men of moderation, but even the leading Nationalists, those branded as Extremists, could not altogether shake off its influence.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1172"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>That was the dream.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The reality to which we awake, is Rawalpindi and Jamalpur.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> a fire does not burn without fuel, and where there is the most revolutionary spirit, there, we can always be sure, has been the most oppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The water tax, the land laws, the Colonisation Act legalising the oppressions and illegalities under which the Punjab landholders and peasantry have groaned, had generated the feeling of an intolerable burden, and when a few fearless men brought to the people the message of self-help, the good tidings that in their own hands lay their own salvation, the men of the Punjab found again their ancient spirit and determined to stand upright in the strength of their manhood.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>They committed no act of violence, they broke no law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>They confined themselves to sending in a statement of their grievances to the Government and passively abstaining from the use of the Canal water so that the bureaucracy might not benefit by an iniquitous tax.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The rulers of India know well that if passive resistance is permitted, the artificial fabric of bureaucratic despotism will fall down like the walls of Jericho before mere sound, with the mere breath of a people’s revolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>To save the situation, they resorted to the usual device of stifling the voice of the people into silence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>On a frivolous pretext they struck at the <i>Punjabee</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The only result was that the calm resolution of the people received its first tinge of fierce indignation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Then the bureaucracy hurriedly resolved to lop off the tall heads – the policy of the tyrant Tarquin which is always the resort of men without judgment or statesmanship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Lala Hansraj, one of the most revered and beloved of the Punjab leaders, a man grown grey in the quiet and selfless service of his country, Ajit Singh, the nationalist orator, and other men of repute and leading were publicly threatened with prosecution and imprisonment as criminals and an enquiry begun with great pomp and circumstance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Then followed a phenomenon unprecedented, we think, in recent Indian history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>For the first time the man in the workshop and the man in the street have risen in revolt for purely political reasons in anger at an attack on purely political leaders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The distinction, which Anglo-India has striven to draw between the ‘Babu class’ and the people, has in the Punjab ceased to exist.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The result is that we have a strange companion picture to that dream of a benevolent and angelic Britain,– a city of unarmed men terrorised by the military, the leaders of the people hurried from their daily avocations to prison, siege-guns pointed at the town, police rifles ready to fire on any group of five men or more to be seen in the street<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="321" href="#">4</a>, bail refused to respectable pleaders and barristers from sheer terror of their influence.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Sir Bampfylde insisted on the disaffiliation of the Serajgunge Schools because the teachers and students were publicly taking part in politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Lord Minto’s Government refused to support him in this action because it was inadvisable, having regard to the troubled nature of the times, and Sir Bampfylde had to resign.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Whatever stronger motives were behind Lord Minto’s action, this was the ostensible occasion for a resignation which practically amounted to a dismissal.<!--/SENT-->

Risley, but it manages to make its object and methods pretty clear.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The object is to put a stop to the system of National Volunteers which is growing up throughout Bengal, to use the Universities as an instrument for stifling the growth of political life and incidentally to prevent men of ability and influence in the educational line from becoming a political power.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1179"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>For students in high schools, “In the interest of the boys themselves, it is clearly undesirable that they should be distracted from their work by attending political meetings or engaging in any form of political agitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In the event of such misconduct being persisted in and encouraged or permitted by masters or managing authorities, the offending school can after due warning be dealt with – (a) by the local Government, which has the power of withdrawing any grant-in-aid and of withholding the privilege of competing for scholarships and of receiving scholarship-holders; (b) by the University, which can withdraw recognition from the school, the effect of which is to prevent it from sending up pupils as candidates for matriculation examination.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Students in high schools<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="322" href="#">1</a> are therefore to be debarred from all political education and brought up on an exclusive diet of Lee-Warner and Empire Day.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Attending political meetings, outside school hours, mind you, and, it may be, with the full consent of the guardians, is to be reckoned as misconduct coming within the scope of school discipline.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is to be punished by the disciplining, that is to say, the flogging or expulsion of the boys.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But what if the teachers or the managing authorities remember that they are men and not dogs who for a little food from the Government are ready to do its will just or unjust?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>What if they decline to do the Government’s dirty work for it?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Then the local magistrate appears on the scene and takes away the grant-in-aid and the privilege of competing for scholarships and of receiving scholarship-holders.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But supposing there should still be found a Vidyasagar or two who would contemptuously spurn these bribes and prefer to keep his manhood?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>For that also this provident circular has provided.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The school can be refused recognition, a refusal which will mean exclusion of its students from a college education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>For this purpose the local Government will report to the University “which alone is legally competent to inflict the requisite penalty”.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Any action which will bring undesirable notoriety upon their college, will be sufficient ground for Government interference.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Picketing is of course forbidden to the student and so is open violence – such for instance as the defence of his father’s house, person and property from Mahomedan <i>goondas</i> or of the chastity of his wife, sister or mother from violation by political hooligans.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>“If, therefore, the public utterances of a schoolmaster are of such a character as to endanger the orderly development of the boys under his charge by introducing into their immature minds doctrines subversive of their respect for authority and calculated to impair their usefulness as citizens and to hinder their advancement in after life, his proceedings must be held to constitute a dereliction of duty, and may properly be visited with disciplinary action.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>In plain unofficial English the schoolmaster will be allowed to teach loyalty and subservience, but if he teaches patriotism, he must be suspended, degraded or dismissed.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We could have understood it, if the authorities had been equally supine and helpless in dealing with Hindus as with Mahomedans, but this is not the case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Compare the action of the Government in the Punjab with that of the Government in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>In the Punjab, because there was a popular riot, all the leading Hindu gentlemen have been arrested on outrageous charges, the town held by cavalry, siege-guns pointed upon it, the police ordered to butcher any group of five to be seen in the streets or public places.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Merely to express indignation and sympathy in answer to such a step, is absurd; it has all the bathos and futility of a foreseen commonplace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Of course we are </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 405</p>
<p class="PE"> indignant, of course we sympathise, but what afterwards?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Have we no duty to perform except the expression of these very natural, unavoidable and entirely useless emotions?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Yes, we <i>demand</i> that the charges against Lajpat Rai should be formulated and proved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>From whom do we make this demand?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>In the case of the Natu brothers it was just possible that pressure in Parliament might induce the Government in England to undo what the Government in Bombay had done in a moment of panic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Here there is no such possibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley has publicly identified himself with this act of arbitrary oppression and his mind is too stiff and rigid with age to change.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The deportation of Lajpat Rai is therefore an action for which the Liberal Government has become responsible and, as such, is bound to have the support of almost the whole Liberal party, while it will certainly have the support of the whole Conservative party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Who then is likely to listen to this empty “demand”?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We could have understood it, if the demand had been coupled with a resolution that the campaign of Boycott, Swadeshi and Swaraj should be pursued with tenfold vigour, that Srijut Bipin Chandra Pal should be asked to return to Madras and complete his programme with additions and Srijut Surendranath Banerji should proceed at once to the North for the same purpose and should take in Gujerat and the Central Provinces in his return journey, and that meanwhile every nerve should be strained to promote and organise the movement in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The resolution would then have had a meaning and the nation would have been inspirited to draw fresh resolve and energy from what would otherwise be a national calamity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>As it stands, this “demand” rings hollow and savours of empty braggadocio.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1231"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The second question before the meeting was the state of things in Eastern Bengal, and here again the meeting dispersed after passing an utterly empty and unpractical resolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>There are various ways in which the situation might be met.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It might have been resolved to arrange a meeting with the leading Mahomedans of Bengal and call upon them to dissociate themselves publicly from Nawab Salimullah and take active steps in order to put a stop to the anti-Hindu ferment which its misbegetters are </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 406</p>
<p class="PE"> now attempting to spread westward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Or, we might have decided in consultation with the Hindu Zamindars in the east to arrange adequate self-defence at every defensible point of the affected areas and withdraw the Hindu element from villages where they were too few to render a good account of themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This would either have compelled the hooligans to throw themselves upon well-defended points and meet the risk of a salutary defeat which they have hitherto avoided, or else left the conflagration to die for want of material to prey upon – unless it turned upon those who had kindled it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But merely to lament the situation and express an astonishment which nobody really feels at the action of the local authorities, is neither helpful nor sincere.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1232"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>A third subject for consideration was the University Coercion Circular.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>This was a crucial point; from the way in which it was dealt with, the country could understand how far the sincerity and resolution of its leaders would go.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>It would perhaps be too much to expect of these gentlemen that they would respond to the insult that has been put upon them by a dignified resolution to sever connection with an enslaved and degraded University and take the education of the country into their own hands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>In the present development of public feeling this would be perfectly practicable and we believe it would be welcomed with enthusiasm by the whole of Bengal; but it requires an amount of enthusiasm and courage which we have ceased to expect from the men who lead us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Surely, however, they might at least have definitely assured the public that they would offer a firm passive resistance to the provisions of the Circular and leave the Government, if it dared, to inflict the penalty of disaffiliation with or without the consent of the Senate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Even this was not done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>“We protest,” and there is an end of the matter.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1233"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The same course was followed with regard to the Ordinance restricting the right of public meeting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Under this Ordinance the Government reserves to itself the power of putting an extinguisher on the Nationalist agitation whenever and wherever it pleases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The agitation has been a public one and had nothing in it secret or underground; but if we submit to the Ordinance, it must lose its public character and adopt other methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Are </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 407</p>
<p class="PE"> we prepared to accept this eventuality?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We had given up petitioning as proved by experience to be futile and cannot return to it without acknowledging defeat and enslaving India for ever to the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Passive resistance has become our chosen weapon and this it is sought to strike out of our hands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>We must, therefore, either oppose an organised passive resistance to this Ordinance, a resistance in which leaders like Srijut Surendranath must court imprisonment and deportation, or we must find other methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>It was light on this question that we expected from Sunday’s meeting, but it has left us only darkness visible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>It seems to be the policy of our leaders to “protest” – and submit.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1237"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We have seldom read anything more disgraceful, more unpatriotic, more opposed to all ideas of decency than the sneering and ill-natured attack on Lala Lajpat Rai which the <i>Tribune</i> has chosen this particular moment to deliver.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is a time when all over India men of all shades of opinion, except the worshippers of the bureaucracy, are putting aside their differences with this modest and self-sacrificing patriot in order to express their unanimous fellow-feeling with him in his hour of trial.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If this unseemly conduct is dictated by a desire to dissociate itself from the exiled patriot in order to save its own skin, it can only be characterised as the basest cowardice; if by envy, party spirit and secret jubilation at the removal of a powerful Nationalist, it is indecent and unpatriotic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In ordinary times the <i>Tribune</i> was free to criticise and abuse Lajpat Rai and nobody would have cared, but when a man is suffering for his country, no one pretending to be a patriot has a right to vent on him either a private spleen or a dislike on public grounds.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1241"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>When we come to look at it closely, the new policy of the British Government in India is a real blessing to the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We find ourselves in unexpected agreement with the Anglo-Indian Press in this matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Anglo-Indian Press is full of joy at these departures from pre-established policy and assevers in one chorus though in many keys, <i>ekam bahudha</i>, that it is the very best thing the bureaucracy could have done in the interests of its own continued supremacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We will not question their authority in a matter in which they alone are interested, but we can certainly add that it is the very best thing the bureaucracy could have done in the interests of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Lord Minto ought therefore to be a very happy man, for it is not everyone whose actions are so blessed by Fate as to command equal approbation from the <i> Englishman</i> and the <i>Bande Mataram</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1242"><!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Our reasons for this approval are obvious on the face of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The great strength of British despotism previous to Lord Curzon’s regime was its indirectness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>By a singularly happy policy it was able to produce on the subject nations the worst moral and material results of serfdom, while at the same time it never allowed them to realise that they were serfs, but rather fostered in them the delusion that they were admirably governed on the whole by an enlightened and philanthropic people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We pointed out the other day that the relics of this superstition still lingered even in the minds of many thoroughgoing Nationalists of the new school.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We did not indeed believe that the bureaucratic Government was a good government or the British people guided in their politics by enlightenment and philanthropy, but many of us believed that there were certain excesses of despotism of which </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 410</p>
<p class="PE"> they were not capable and that the worst British administration would not easily betray overt signs of moral kinship with its Russian cousin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We ourselves, although we were prepared for the worst and always took care to warn the people that the worst might soon come, thought sometimes that there was a fair balance of probabilities for and against frank downward Russianism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>For such last relics of the old superstitions, for such over-charitable speculation there is no longer any room.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The whole country owes a debt of gratitude to Sirdar Ajit Singh and the Bharat Mata section of the Punjab Nationalists for forcing the hands of the bureaucracy and compelling them to change definitely indirect for direct methods of despotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It has cleared the air, it has dispelled delusions; it has forced us to look without blinking into the face of an iron Necessity.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1243"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The question may then be asked, what farther room is there for passive resistance?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>A Punjab politician is said to have observed, after the arrests of Lala Hansraj and his friends and the first development of violent insanity in the Punjab authorities, “I do not see why the people should go on any longer with open agitation.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But, in our opinion, there is still room for passive resistance, if for nothing else than to force the bureaucracy to lay all its cards face upward on the table; the oppression must either be broken or increased so that the iron may enter deeper into the soul of the nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>There is still work and work enough for the martyr, before the hero appears on the scene.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Take for instance the Coercion Ukase, the new ordinance to restrict the right of public meeting at the sweet will of the executive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It is obvious that the matter cannot be allowed to rest where it is.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We would suggest to the leaders that the right policy to begin with is to ignore the existence of the Ordinance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>So far as we understand, the Lieutenant-Governor of Shillong has been empowered to proclaim any area in his jurisdiction, but as yet no area has been proclaimed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This is therefore the proper time for the leaders to go to East Bengal and hold meetings in every District; and those who go, should not be any lesser men but the leaders of the two parties in Bengal themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We are inclined to think it was a mistake to recall Srijut Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="337" href="#">1</a> Chandra Pal </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 411</p>
<p class="PE"> from Madras at this juncture; but since he has been recalled, it should be for a joint action in East Bengal against the policy of repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If the bureaucracy lie low, well and good; it will be a moral victory for the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But the moment any particular area is proclaimed, the leaders should immediately go there and hold the prohibited meetings as a challenge to the validity of the ukase, refusing to disperse except on the application of force by the police or the military.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy will then have the choice either of allowing the Ordinance to remain a dead letter or of imprisoning or deporting men the prosecution of whom will so inflame the people all over India as to make administration impossible or of breaking up meetings by force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>If they adopt the third alternative, the leaders should then go from place to place and house to house, like political Shankaracharyas, gathering the people together in groups in private houses and compounds and speaking to them in their gates, advising them, organising them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>In this way the fire of Nationalism will enter into every nook and cranny of the country and a strength be created far greater than any which monster meetings can engender.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>How will the bureaucracy meet such a method of propagandism?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Will they forbid us to congregate in our own compounds?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Will their police enter our houses and force us to shut our gates to the guest and the visitor?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Whatever they do, the country will gain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Every fresh object-lesson in bureaucratic methods will be a fresh impulse to the determination to achieve Swaraj and get rid of the curse of subjection.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>All that is needed to meet the situation, all that we demand of our leaders is a quiet, self-possessed, unflinching courage which neither the fear of imprisonment, nor the menace of deportation, nor the ulterior possibility of worse than deportation can for a moment disturb.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">Mr. Morley’s Pronouncement</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1247"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The attitude assumed by Mr. John Morley in answer to the questions in Parliament about the latest act of mediaeval tyranny, cannot surprise those who have something more than surface knowledge of English politics and English politicians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Those who have been behind the scenes in English political life, know perfectly well that there sincerity is an element which does not exist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Professions, principles, ideals are the tinsel and trappings of the stage; each politician is an actor who has a part to play and plays it, certain set sentiments to mouth and mouths them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But the only reality behind is a mass of interests, personal interests, class interests, party interests, and the ruling principle of action is to “catch votes” and avoid the loss of votes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We have all noticed how persistently the Anglo-Indian Press out here talk of every movement as being artificial and the work of “professional agitators”, and how persistently they refuse to credit the popular leaders, even when they are men of high moral worth like Lala Lajpat Rai, with sincerity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We generally put this down to the perverseness and wilful misrepresentation of a reptile press; the real truth is that they are judging us from their knowledge of their own country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>They are perfectly well aware that in England politics is a huge piece of humbug; it professes to be a conflict of principles and is really a conflict of more or less sordid interests.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>They know that in England a sincere politician is a contradiction in terms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>They are therefore unable to believe in the existence in India of a sincerity and reality for which their own country offers no precedent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The only exceptions to the general rule of insincerity are the novices in politics – the maiden innocence of whose souls is soon rubbed off by a few Parliamentary sessions,–</p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 413</p>
<p class="PE"> and a handful of independent-minded eccentrics who have no chance whatever of rising to influence, much less to office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Occasionally a man of absolute sincerity like Mr.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Bradlaugh breaks the record, but that is only once in half a century.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1248"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>When Mr. John Morley entered politics, he entered as a literary man and austere philosopher and brought the spirit of philosophy into politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>His unbending fidelity to his principles earned him the name of Honest John, and this soubriquet, with the reputation for uprightness of which it was the badge, has survived long after the uprightness itself had perished in the poisoned air of office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>No one can be long a Cabinet Minister in England and yet remain a man of unswerving principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>As Indian Secretary, Mr. Morley could not be expected to carry his philosophic principles into the India Office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>On the contrary, there were several reasons why he should be even more reactionary than ordinary Secretaries of State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The Secretary of State does not represent India or stand for her interests; he represents England and his first duty is to preserve British supremacy; but Mr. Morley is also one of the foremost exponents of the most arrogant and exclusive type of enlightenment in nineteenth-century Europe, the scientific, rationalist, agnostic, superior type.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>As such, he was the last man to think well of or understand Asiatics or to regard them as anything but semi-barbarous anachronisms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Moreover, as the <i>Bengalee</i>’s London correspondent pointed out this week, he is evidently showing signs of senile decay which is shown partly in his growing ill-temper and intolerance of contradiction, but most in the mental languor which prevents him from questioning or scrutinising the opinions and information served up to him by the India Office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The verbatim fidelity with which he reproduces whatever Anglo-India tutors him to say, is strikingly evidenced by his answers to Messrs. Rutherford and O’Grady.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>His remarks on the situation in East Bengal might have been taken for an extract from the <i>Englishman</i>’s editorials or from the imaginative reports of the special correspondent of the <i>Empire</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1249"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley makes no attempt to justify the arbitrary action he has sanctioned except on the plea of necessity, the tyrant’s </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 414</p>
<p class="PE"> plea, which no one in former days would have held up more eloquently to condemnation and ridicule than Mr. Morley himself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>He does not tell us why Lala Lajpat Rai was deported or what were the charges against him; probably he does not himself know, but simply accepted the assurance of the able and experienced Denzil and the level-headed Minto that the step was necessary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>For they are the men on the spot, and Mr. Morley’s conception of his position in the India Office is that he is there to act as a buffer between the men on the spot and adverse criticism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We need not discuss his utterances; they are merely faithful echoes of Anglo-Indian special pleading, in which there is nothing that is new and very little that is true.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But the threat which he held out to the Moderate party is worth noting.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>For some time Mr. Morley and Lord Minto, with whom the Secretary of State rather superfluously assures us that he has an excellent understanding, have been talking big of some wonderful reform that they have up their sleeves and feverishly assuring the world that these fine things are all their very own idea and by no means forced on them by Indian agitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And now we are told, or rather the Moderate leaders are told, that they will lose these pretty toys if they do not help the bureaucracy to put down “disorder”, or, in other words, to put down Nationalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley offers them a certain administrative reform if they can give up for themselves or can induce their countrymen to give up the aspiration towards freedom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The Anglo-Indian journals all take up the cry and the absolute insincerity of it is sufficiently shown by the fact that even so venomous, reactionary and anti-Indian a print as the <i>Englishman</i> proses solemnly on the theme!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The object of these threats is manifest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The sudden succession of coercive measures may for a moment have stunned the people, it may for a few days dismay the more timid, but it has certainly created a deep and settled exasperation throughout the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The dismay is temporary, the exasperation will be permanent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley and Anglo-India hope to take advantage of the moment of dismay in order to half-bribe, half-intimidate the Moderate party into detaching themselves from any opposition to these coercive measures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>This is a vain hope.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>For even to the <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> meanest political intelligence two considerations will at once occur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The first is that there is such a thing as buying a pig in a poke.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Even the simplest buyer will want to see the animal before he puts down its price, and even the most confiding Moderate will want to know what is this wonderful reform of Mr. Morley’s before he sells the country’s future and risks his influence with the people for its sake.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>But on this point Mr. Morley preserves as studious a silence as on the charges against Lajpat Rai.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Again, Mr. Morley and Lord Minto have hinted that their measure is an instalment of self-government, yet Mr. Morley emphatically declares that he will never strip the bureaucracy of any means of repression they possess, however barbarous and antiquated.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1253"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> yesterday made its pronouncement on the Risley Circular which closes with the following remarks.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>“If the Government persist in their present career of folly, one of two things must happen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Either the official university will be absolutely supplanted by a comprehensive system of national education or, if that consummation cannot be easily realised, generations of young men will turn their energies and attention to active and practical, as distinguished from academic pursuits.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We are not sure that either way the country will be a loser.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1254"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There is a certain note of weakness in the conditional way in which this is presented, which somewhat spoils the effect of the declaration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We cannot understand why we should wait to see whether the Government persist in their present career of folly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The policy of the Government in this educational matter is manifestly a deliberate policy undertaken with a definite object and there is no reason to suppose that they will not persist in it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>This habit of waiting on the actions of the bureaucracy rests on a weak and mistaken principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The victory both in war and politics rests with the side which can reply to attack by taking up the aggressive; a continual defence and waiting on the enemy’s movements is weakening and demoralising.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>And why should a comprehensive system of National Education and the turning of young men to active and practical pursuits be mutually exclusive?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Surely, increasing attention to technical, commercial and scientific instruction is a necessary part of any sound system of National Education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is gratifying, however, to find that there is no intention of submitting to this resolution or any other like it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>To those like us outside the esoteric circle – and they by no means form a microscopic minority – the distinction between the two places, on the present occasion, seems immaterial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Of course it needs no ghost to tell us that Mandalay is not the Andamans.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But are not both places equally suited to the requirements of the Government?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It was not the intention of the Government to remove Lajpat Rai to a particular place with a view to subject him to a particular kind of climate.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1268"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We do not know why the paper which calls itself the Friend of India and usually puts on a sanctimonious mask of Liberalism, should have suddenly allowed its real feelings to betray themselves last Wednesday.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Its attitude for some time past has been extremely ambiguous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>During the height of the disturbances in East Bengal this Friend of India maintained a rigid silence on Indian affairs and discoursed solemnly day after day on large questions of European policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Like the Levite it turned its face away from the traveller wounded by thieves and passed by.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Since the deportation of Lajpat Rai, it has cared less and less to preserve its tone of affected sympathy until on the 15th it appeared as the apologist of despotism and the mouthpiece not of an idea or of a policy, but of the individual grievances of a self-seeking politician whose influence has waned to nothing because he could not satisfy the new demand for courageous and disinterested patriotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Professing to be a Liberal paper, the <i> Statesman</i> has defended the despotic regulation under which Lala Lajpat Rai was deported,– a regulation opposed to all the fundamental principles of Liberalism; it has defended the Coercion Ordinance as a proof of the leniency and liberalism of bureaucratic rule in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Calling itself a Friend of India, it has not scrupled to dissociate itself from its brother friends of India, the British Committee of the Congress, and sneer at them as ill-informed nobodies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>After throwing the Congress, its principles and its friends overboard in this extraordinary manner, it has still the assurance to pose as the guide, philosopher and friend of the Moderate party and lecture them on the necessity of supporting the Government in its action with regard to Lala Lajpat Rai.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1269"><!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 420</p>
<p class="PE">The arguments with which the <i>Statesman</i> defends the deportation as a supreme act of Liberalism, are of a remarkable kind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>First, deportation “is not really so bad as it sounds”, because “the lot of the so-called political exile is considerably happier than that of the criminal in the common jail”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Prodigious!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>A man is arrested without any charge being formulated against him, without trial, without any chance of defending himself, separated suddenly from his family and friends, his country, his work for religion, society and motherland, and relegated to solitary imprisonment in a distant fortress; yet because he is not treated as Mr. Tilak was treated, as a common criminal with the daily harassment and degradation which is part of the criminal’s punishment, this remarkable Liberal organ goes into ecstasies over the leniency of the British bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Injustice and arbitrary oppression, in its opinion, is an admirable thing so long as it is not accompanied with vindictive personal cruelty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We remember a correspondent of an Anglo-Indian print at the time of Mr. Tilak’s sentence calling on the Mahrattas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="343" href="#">1</a> to admire the leniency of the British Government, because it treated him as an ordinary felon instead of impaling him or sawing him to pieces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> writes in the same spirit.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1270"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The second plea in defence of deportation is that no act of State is involved in the arrest, it is only a summary dealing under Municipal law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>We do not know what to make of this rigmarole or what the <i> Statesman</i> understands by Municipal law or by an act of State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Municipal law may mean the laws and rules which govern municipalities, but we presume it is not the Lahore Municipality which deported Lajpat Rai; or it may mean the ordinary laws and regulations by which local authorities arrange for local administration and the preservation of the peace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But here is an extraordinary action, above the ordinary laws, which needs the sanction of the Government of India and the sanction of the Secretary of State, in which a political leader is arrested for mysterious political reasons and deported without trial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Yet this is municipal law, not an act of State! and since it is municipal law, no one need protest against it!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Apparently an act of State in the <i>Statesman</i>’s opinion is an <i>illegal</i> act which there is no statute </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 421</p>
<p class="PE"> to cover.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Any action however tyrannical, if covered by a statute, ought to be borne without complaint by Indians as an act of great leniency and liberalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Mark again the friendship of this friend of India and the liberalism of this Liberal.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1271"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>A third plea is that “the action of the authorities in India, if contrasted with that of the average European Government, is leniency itself.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>So then, tyranny is quite justifiable if it can cite<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="344" href="#">2</a> an example of another tyranny worse than itself!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Let us remind the <i>Statesman</i> that the French and German bureaucracies are governments supported by the will of the people and that in the measures of stringency they adopt, they have the consent of the people behind them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>And what have the police arrangements of Paris and Berlin to do with the punishment of a man without trial, a relic of mediaeval<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="345" href="#">3</a> despotism of which no modern and civilised Government offers an example?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1272"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The real cause of all this special pleading for despotism is revealed in the latter part of the article.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>“Moderate men are apt to be pushed aside and their services forgotten by new men who seek to force the pace.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>“A long apprenticeship to journalism, a weary plodding in the musty by-paths of the law, are the chief or only means by which power and influence can be gained.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>This is where the shoe pinches.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Who is this apprentice to journalism who is being pushed aside by young and extreme journals?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Obviously the <i>Statesman</i> itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Who is this weary plodder in the musty by-paths of the law, who claims that only lawyers or, say, only solicitors have any right to be political leaders and whose “fame”, if not his “fortune”, has been affected by the new movement?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It is plain enough now that the motive which so long actuated the <i>Statesman</i> was not liberal sentiment or high principles, but its own interest and influence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Since that interest was touched and that influence threatened by the increasing spirit of Swadeshism and self-reliance, the temper of this Friend of ours has been growing worse and worse until he has finally renounced his liberal principles and become a champion of bureaucracy.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1273"><!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The article closes with a curious attack which seems to be directed at Srijut Surendranath Banerji.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>“Violent speeches, inflammatory writings, a prosecution, a brilliantly unsuccessful </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 422</p>
<p class="PE"> defence, paragraphs in all the newspapers, <i>questions by ill-informed nobodies in the House of Commons</i>, the jail, the exit, fame and fortune, notoriety, maybe a seat in Parliament – here we have not altogether a fancy picture of the modern Political Rake’s progress.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>This is, we are told, not altogether a fancy picture; in other words, with the exception of the last touch about the possible seat in Parliament, it is taken from life<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="346" href="#">4</a>; and to whom can it be applied but Srijut Surendranath?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>For, obviously, no leader of the new school is meant, since no leader of the new school would aspire to a seat in Parliament.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Yet after this ill-natured attack the <i>Statesman</i> yesterday had again the face to figure as the patron and counsellor<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="347" href="#">5</a> of Srijut Surendranath and advise him to sacrifice his feelings of personal friendship and respect for Lala Lajpat Rai, his principles, his patriotism, his reputation as a political leader and his influence with the people in order to get the approbation of Mr. John Morley and the <i>Statesman</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1274"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>A more complete unmasking could not be imagined.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The <i> Statesman</i> not only attacks the new school,– that would be nothing new – but turns round and rends his old<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="348" href="#">6</a> associates, Srijut Surendranath, the British Committee, the friends of India in Parliament, renounces all liberal ideas and principles, throws off every disguise and stands forth naked and unashamed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>We recommend this example of “friendship” to all Bengali customers of the <i> Statesman</i>’s heavy goods, and would advise them either to cease patronising a dealer of such doubtful candour or to insist that the goods they get shall be of the pattern they have paid for.<!--/SENT--></p>

Mudholkar</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1282"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Nothing can be more instructive than the way in which recent events have arrayed all Anglo-Indians, “liberal” or reactionary, on one side and on the other hand brought all Indian politicians, moderate or “extremist”, nearer to each other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It shows that the profound division of interests creates an unbridgeable gulf between the aliens in possession and the people of the country in their different degrees of aspiration.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1283"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Apparent alliances between Anglo-India and any section of the people, can only be temporary adjustments of self-interest or of policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>When the crucial moment comes, each must return to his own camp and stand in sharply-defined opposition to his recent ally.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We have had occasion to comment strongly on the recent unmasking of the <i>Statesman</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It was emphasised yesterday by the bitter and unscrupulous attack of that paper on Mr. Mudholkar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Mr. Mudholkar is the leading Moderate politician of the Berars, a man almost timid in his caution and one of the chief opponents of the new Nationalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>One would have thought therefore that the <i>Statesman</i> would have the decency at least to treat him with some affectation of respect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But Mr. Mudholkar is handled as roughly and hectored and lectured as insolently as if he had been a Tilak or a Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="353" href="#">1</a> Pal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The attack is not only insolent; it is unscrupulous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The <i> Statesman</i> does not hesitate to misrepresent Mr. Mudholkar in order to serve its own ends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>This is how it distorts Mr. Mudholkar’s letter in one instance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>“We read at the outset that the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="354" href="#">2</a> theory of provocation is ridiculous and absurd; but in the succeeding sentence Mr. Mudholkar impliedly admits that it was the conduct of a few indiscreet young men that furnished the immediate occasion of the riot.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 425</p>
<p class="PE"> <i>This, we believe, has now been definitely established</i>.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Anyone who takes the trouble to read Mr. Mudholkar’s letter will see at once that he does not admit either impliedly or directly that there was provocation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>He says, “Assuming <i>what has yet to be proved</i>, that the impassioned advocacy of Swadeshi goods by the National Volunteers was distasteful to the Mahomedans, how could it possibly serve as a provocation?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And proceeding with this assumption, he asks in the next sentence how this alleged indiscretion of a few young men at the Mela could produce so fearful a riot?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We cannot credit the <i>Statesman</i> with sufficient dullness or ignorance of the English language as to suppose that its distortion of Mr. Mudholkar’s argument is not deliberate.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1284"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>And when, may we ask, was it “definitely established” that the indiscretion of a few Volunteers was the cause of the riot?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>We know that it is so stated by the correspondents of Anglo-Indian papers whose evidence, being mere hearsay, has no value whatever, and we presume that this is what they have been told by the police officials who are accused of complicity in leading the Hindus into a carefully-prepared trap.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But the statements of the Hindus who were attacked, stand as yet uncontroverted by independent evidence and unrefuted by any reliable enquiry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i>, feeling the weakness of its case, tries to justify the action of the Mahomedan rowdies by saying that there has been a rise of prices round about Jamalpur as the result of the Swadeshi agitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>This is, in the <i>Statesman</i>’s view, sufficiently grave provocation!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Well, possibly so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>There has been, we know, an immense rise of prices all over India owing to the British occupation, to which the present rise of prices is absolutely nothing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Would that, in the <i>Statesman</i>’s view, be sufficiently grave provocation for the whole of India to rise in riot or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="355" href="#">3</a> rebellion?<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1285"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> has no real answer to Mr. Mudholkar’s arguments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Its answer to him consists merely of a prolonged charge of exaggerated language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Mr. Mudholkar described the state of things in East Bengal by the words “anarchy, rapine, desecration, bloodshed”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>These words the <i> Statesman</i> stigmatises as “ludicrously inappropriate to the facts”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Indeed?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The facts are that for the space of several weeks village after village was plundered </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 426</p>
<p class="PE"> and property to the value of many lakhs looted; yet this is a state of things which we are not to be allowed to term rapine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>During the same time images were destroyed, temples attacked and desecrated, a religious celebration forbidden by armed rowdies; yet all this did not amount to desecration!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Life and person were unsafe, numbers of men were hurt, some so seriously as to be sent to the hospital, two or three were brutally murdered, yet the <i>Statesman</i> thinks there was no bloodshed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>For this space of time life and property and the honour of women were unsafe over a large area, the Hindus had to flee from Jamalpur and in all neighbouring places to organise their own defence, panic and riot and outrage reigned supreme while the constituted authorities busied themselves repressing the community attacked and threatened, leaving a free hand to the rioters; but this is not to be called anarchy!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>No, all these<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="356" href="#">4</a>, says this miraculous Friend of India, were mere ordinary local disturbances <i>which would scarcely have attracted notice</i> but for the profoundness of the Pax Britannica.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Mark the opinions of your Friend, people of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The desecration of your temples, the violation of your women, the wholesale plunder of your property are to him things that scarcely deserve to attract notice.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1286"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> again rebukes Mr. Mudholkar for exaggerating the riot at Rawalpindi which it holds to be a very ordinary affair, and thinks that because Mr. Mudholkar has exaggerated this and other matters, therefore Indians are unfit to be entrusted with the administration of their own affairs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Yet in the same article the <i>Statesman</i> justifies the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai, <i>even if he were innocent</i>, because the occurrences in the Punjab were considered by the Government so serious that his removal was a necessity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Here is a consistent Friend of India!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>But if Mr. Mudholkar’s exaggerated ideas of the Rawalpindi disturbances unfit his countrymen for self-government, still more do Sir Denzil Ibbetson’s and the <i>C. M. Gazette</i>’s yet more exaggerated ideas of the same occurrences show that Englishmen are unfit to rule India.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1287"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The only point that the <i>Statesman</i> successfully makes against Mr. Mudholkar is when it disproves his belief that such </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 427</p>
<p class="PE"> arbitrary and tyrannical proceedings are subversive of the principles of British law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>This delusion of the Moderates ought now to be renounced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>They have always laboured under the delusion that because the British Government as apart from its local instruments, acts within the law, it is therefore incapable of oppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>On the contrary, as the <i>Statesman</i> points out, the British laws give ample room and provide adequate weapons for methods of despotic repression which are often indistinguishable in kind, though less direct and brutal than Russian methods.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1288"><!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>None, says the <i>Statesman</i> sanctimoniously, has laboured more devotedly than ourselves in the case of India’s political emancipation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>We have heard legends that have come down to us from the times of our fathers of occasional active help given by the <i>Statesman</i> to their constitutional agitation, but we do not know what it has done recently beyond promising reforms which never come and thriving on the support of the Indian public.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Certainly this is not enough to entitle it to lecture one of the leaders of public opinion and revile him as a “ranter”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>We hope that Mr. Mudholkar will learn his lesson, cease to appeal to English rulers and English journals and address himself in future to his own countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Let him join hands with us in training them into a strength which will be a far greater security against “anarchy, rapine, desecration and bloodshed” than the protecting arm of the bureaucracy or the friendship of the <i>Statesman</i>.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1292"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy is developing its campaign against Swadeshism with great<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="357" href="#">1</a> rapidity and a really admirable energy and decision.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Barisal was naturally the first district to be declared, and now we learn that Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Pabna, Rungpur and Tipperah<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="358" href="#">2</a>, the Habiganj sub-division of the district of Sylhet and the Sudharam Thana in the district of Noakhali have also been proclaimed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Others, no doubt, will follow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>All these districts have been selected for the prominence they have taken in the Swadeshi movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is significant also that in Bakarganj<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="359" href="#">3</a> the proclamation has been attended by a Magisterial order which forbids the carrying of <i>lathis</i> and swordsticks between sunrise and sunset and the gathering of men in strength after nightfall.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This can have no other effect than to prevent the Swadeshists offering an effective resistance in case of an attack being organised at night under orders from Dacca; for it is not likely that a lawless mob bent upon mischief would pay any heed to the Magisterial ukase.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile we have seen at Tangail a foreshadowing of the first line of attack on the students under cover of the Risley Circular.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The objective of the authorities is clear enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is to prevent the promulgation and organisation of the Swadeshi and Swaraj sentiment in Punjab and Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>In the promulgation of Swadeshism we have used three great instruments, the Press, the Platform and the students.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The Press by itself can only popularise ideas, it cannot impart that motive impulse of deep emotion and enthusiasm which is given by the direct appeal, the personal magnetism of a born speaker.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But the work of the Platform in its turn is not sufficient in itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The motive impulse created by the orator is apt to be evanescent, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 429</p>
<p class="PE"> unless it is confirmed by daily insistence on the note sounded and the inspiring sight of the idea being actually carried into practice by devout and enthusiastic missionaries of the creed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>In the Swadeshi agitation this part, the most important and necessary of the three, has been played by the students.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is they who have been the active missionaries of Swadeshism, carrying it into practice with the divine ardour and eagerness of youth, without the reserves of caution, temporising, doubt, half-belief with which colder age would have killed it in its birth; wherever they went, they have created a permanent Swadeshi <i>atmosphere</i> in which the tender plant of Nationalism could grow, could put forth leaf and bud, could flower into the religion of patriotism.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1293"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The English have a long experience in the art of political agitation and it could not take them long to discover where the strength of the agitation lay.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But they were for a long time at a loss how to deal with it without losing their prestige and reputation as a strong and benign Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>They tried experiments and would not carry them out to the end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>They took up a policy of direct and violent coercion in a limited area and then, alarmed at the noise and opposition created, dropped it like a hot coal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Next they tried the effect of a general attitude of “sympathy” and calm toleration covering with its specious and ample cloak a great deal of petty local persecution and secret undermining of Swadeshism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile they were preparing the ground for an anti-Hindu campaign through the instrumentality of the Mahomedans which was only to be brought into use if the policy of “sympathy” failed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The policy of sympathy did fail and the local authorities were allowed to let loose the Mahomedan mob on the Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Here again there was a failure or a very partial success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The first attempt at Comilla miscarried owing to the high spirit and good organisation of Comilla Swadeshism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The second blow at Jamalpur fell with tremendous effect, but the additional outbreak on the 27th upset the official apple-cart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It went much farther, probably, than was originally intended; for, possibly, the original intention was simply to teach the Swadeshi Hindus a lesson and perhaps to give an excuse for exceptional measures.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But the second outbreak went too far.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>It drove the </p>

<p class="PE"> Hindus out of Jamalpur, it identified the officials publicly and unmistakably with the hooligans, it lit a fire that spread all over Bengal and created a commotion throughout India; it gave a stupendous impulse to the self-defence movement all over the province; it found a few scattered <i>akharas</i> and left the whole Hindu population feverishly drilling and standing on guard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Finally, it threatened to imperil Anglo-Indian trade by prolonging the disturbances into the critical part of the jute season.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Moreover, the attempt of the officials to isolate Swarajism in East Bengal had failed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Swarajism had set fire to the Punjab, it had begun to permeate the United Provinces, it was spreading with great rapidity in Madras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Another year and the whole of India would have been submerged.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1294"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It was these circumstances, apparently, which led the Government to the resolution of grappling with the Frankenstein monster Lord Curzon had raised and of deploying all the powers and instruments of despotism for its suppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The panic created by the Rawalpindi disturbance has only led it to unmask its batteries sooner and concentrate all its fire on Swadeshism with greater energy and rapidity than might otherwise have been the case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>No direct attempt has yet been made to silence the Press, but we have no doubt it will be done, if the Government find that the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai does not produce a permanent change in its tone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>On the other hand, very effective measures have been taken against the Platform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The wholesale arrests in Rawalpindi, the monstrous charges brought against Lala Hansraj and others for no worse offence than being present at a public meeting which happened to be followed in point of time by a riot, the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai are all measures of intimidation against the Platform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Lest these should prove insufficient, the bureaucracy has armed itself with powers which, if carefully used, will put an end to Swadeshi propaganda from the Platform and can in any case crush it by violent and persistent coercion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It is applied, on the familiar principle of localising opposition and crushing it in detail, to East Bengal and Punjab only, but can easily be extended, should occasion arise.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 431</p>
<p class="PE"> the hands of Nationalism its chief strength, the young and rising generation whose political activity in their student days means the creation of a new race of men whom it will be impossible to rule by despotic methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>If we submit, therefore, to these bureaucratic measures it means that the three potent instruments of our movement will be rendered useless for our purposes and Swadeshism is at an end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy will necessarily wait to see how we take its attack.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>If we submit, they will not incur unnecessary odium by pressing the measures too hard but will hold them <i>in terrorem</i> over us and apply them lightly wherever necessary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>If we try to carry on the movement, they will carry on the campaign of Russianism to the bitter end, regardless of ulterior consequences, unless the developments are such as to convince them that the Russian method is useless or worse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile, as is shown by the deputation of Mr. Beatson Bell to Mymensingh, efforts will be made to get the Mahomedan outbreak under control again, if for nothing else than in the interests of jute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The Anglo-Indian cry of “jute in danger” is one which cannot be ignored.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>Until the gathering in of the jute, there will probably be no farther Mahomedan turbulence except in sporadic instances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>What will happen afterwards, will depend much on the course of events between.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>We may also expect other attempts besides the mere application of the Risley Circular to take the sting out of the volunteer movement.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1295"><!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>Such is the prospect before us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>It is high time that we should decide how we are to meet it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The first to be considered, because the most dramatic and striking of these measures, is the deportation of Lala Lajpat Rai.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Has this deportation brought any really new element into the problem?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>When we began the movement, we were prepared, or at least we professed to be prepared, for the utmost use by the Government of all the weapons the existing law puts in its hand<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="360" href="#">1</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We were prepared for press-prosecutions, we were prepared to go to jail on false charges, we refused to be appalled by regulation <i>lathis</i>, broken heads and Gurkha charges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Whatever use the Bengal Government might make of the repressive laws which stand on its statute books, to whatever advantage the local magistracy might turn their powers of government by ukase, we were prepared for everything, we started with the fixed determination to allow nothing to daunt us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Deportation was also a pre-existing weapon of repression available to the bureaucracy under the existing laws.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The difference its use has made, is to bring in, in the place of provincial repression by the local government, imperial repression by the Government of India with the approval of the Secretary of State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It has also replaced the long and uncertain process of trial ending in a punishment of fixed duration by the swift and sudden process of kidnapping and a punishment – no, we apologise to the Friend of India, we should rather say a leniency of uncertain, perhaps life-long duration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>One other element it has introduced which patriots have had to face in all other countries, but which falls on our heads for the first time,– the punishment of exile.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>To speak </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 434</p>
<p class="PE"> the truth, this is the one and only terror of deportation to Indian patriots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The Indian mind with its passionate attachment to the very soil of the mother-country, its deep reverent feeling that mother and motherland are more to be cherished than paradise itself, must feel the deprivation with a force which no European race, except perhaps the passionate and emotional Italian, could understand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>In jail the floor we tread is at least made of Indian soil; when we exercise in the prison yard, the air that visits our cheeks is Indian air; the pulsation of Indian aspiration, Indian emotion, Indian life, Indian joys and sorrows beats around our prison walls and floods our hearts with the magnetic pervasiveness of which the air of India is more full than that of any other country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy blundered upon an ingenious way of striking us in a very vulnerable point when it hurried Lajpat Rai away to a remote corner of the world among alien men and cut him off from all sight of Indian faces and communion with Indian hearts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But what then?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is but one suffering the more, and the deeper the suffering the greater the glory, the more celestial the reward.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1304"><!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Yet it cannot be denied that the deportation came as a shock on the Moderates and as a surprise to the Extremists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It was a shock to the Moderates because of the source from which it came.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>They had never been able to shake off the idea that in the end Mr. John Morley, if not the sympathetic Lord Minto, would come to their help.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>To renounce that hope would be to reject the very keystone of the Moderate policy and turn their backs for ever on the illusions of thirty years.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Even up to the moment almost of the deportation the <i> Bengalee</i> was clamouring for the recall of Mr. Hare and confidently expecting that his criminal inactivity in the East Bengal disturbances would be punished by a just and benign Secretary of State.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>On such high expectations the deportation came as a blow straight in the face </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 435</p>
<p class="PE"> and struck the Moderate party dumb and senseless for a moment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The heaviness of the blow it had received can be judged by the sudden violence of the <i>Indu Prakash</i> which exceeded in the fierce anger of its utterances any Extremist organ.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>There is no disguising the fact that the Moderate’s occupation is gone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>British rule has so unmistakably, finally, irrevocably declared itself as despotism naked and unashamed, a despotism moreover which is firmly resolved to remain despotic,– the fiction of a constitution has been so relentlessly exposed as a sheer mockery and constitutional agitation has thereby been rendered such a patent, elaborate and heartless farce that, although it will continue just as the snake continues to wriggle even after it has been cut into two, it has lost all life and all chance of carrying weight in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The temper of the Madras meeting, which a serious and influential paper like the <i>Madras Standard</i> asserts to have been composed mainly not of students but of adults, shows what the temper of the nation is likely to be.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The deportation therefore has introduced a new element for the Moderate politician.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>His gods have failed him; the benign hand from which he expected favours, has treated him instead to a whip of scorpions; the face of flowers he worshipped has had its veil torn away and stands revealed as a grinning death’s head.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>It can no longer exist except as a pretence, an attitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>To the Nationalist the deportation came as a surprise because of the occasion for which it was employed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We knew that the benignant bureaucracy had this weapon in their armoury, that they had used it once and might well use it again; but we thought it had more respect for its prestige and more common sense than to waste it on an insufficient occasion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The Natus were deported because it was suspected that they were behind the Poona assassinations and that the assassinations themselves were part of an elaborate Maratha conspiracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>In the Punjab there was nothing but a riot; for the persistent wild rumours of the disarming of regiments and murder of Europeans have received no confirmation of any kind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Deportation, as directed against the Nationalist movement, was like the magic weapon of Karna which could be used only once <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> with effect; it should therefore have been reserved for a supreme occasion when it might have averted, for the time at least, an incipient mutiny or formidable rebellion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>It was used instead in a moment of panic to meet a <i>fancied</i> mutiny; it was used not against the formidable and indispensable leader of a great approaching rebellion; but against a boy-orator and a pleader of considerable influence who at the worst was no more than one of the many prophets of revolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Meant for Arjuna, it has been hurled against Ghatotkach<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="363" href="#">4</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>This misuse deprives it of its utility; for as the <i>Empire</i> shrewdly pointed out the other day the trick of deportation cannot be successfully played twice; the second time it will be a direct help to the strong revolutionary forces which are growing in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>To the Nationalists therefore the menace of deportation does not bring in any new element into the situation, except in so far as it hastens their work or brings the leaders as well as the rank and file to the touchstone of peril where their value will be tested.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1305"><!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The new element of deportation, therefore, so far as it is a new element, merely facilitates the work of Nationalism.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>We may be told of course that we cannot afford to imperil the leaders on whom the progress of the movement depends.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>We answer that the safety of the leaders can only be assured by sacrificing the vitality and force of the movement, a price too heavy to pay; secondly where the will of a higher Power is active in a great upheaval, no individual is indispensable.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1309"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>There is no quality which the British race more persistently arrogates to itself, as if it were their monopoly, than truth and frankness.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>On the contrary, the epithet “perfidious Albion” in which the French summed up their experience of English character before the present “cordial understanding” and to which they may have to revert when it is over, expresses the general opinion of their fellow-Europeans on the British claim to an unique and superior righteousness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The conviction of British political hypocrisy, large promise-making when it suited them and large promise-breaking now that that suits them, is the final conclusion to which India has been driven on the same subject.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>There is another quality of which the English are equally proud, their fair-play and generosity to enemies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Here again the world’s opinion of them does not coincide with their opinion of themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>On the contrary, no nation is capable of greater meanness and venomous hatred in its treatment of the enemies and opponents who are so unfortunate as to fall into its hands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The generosity is reserved for those enemies who have beaten them in fight, like Washington, or with whom they have to come to an understanding after an equal struggle, like Botha.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But towards others and specially for those who have put them in fear for their national existence or their supremacy or their commerce and then fallen into their power, they observe neither chivalry nor fairness nor truth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It was the British fair-play which in mediaeval times burned Joan of Arc at the stake and then for some centuries vilely slandered her character.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It was British fair-play which pursued Napoleon during his lifetime with a campaign of slander and abuse of the most extraordinary vileness and then interned him in St.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We see the same national characteristic in the shameful vilification in which the Anglo-Indian Press have indulged against the patriot whose influence in the Punjab has put in fear for their empire and their trade.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We waive the question whether Lajpat Rai was or was not really guilty from the standpoint of the bureaucracy, <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="3.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> whether he was or he was not actively working against the continuance of British rule, as he certainly was actively working against the continuance of irresponsible bureaucratic despotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But as to the personal character of Lajpat Rai, his personal uprightness, honesty, candour, his earnest diligence in working for the religious, social and political elevation of his country, his unostentatious self-sacrifice, his modest worth, his quiet courage, even his opponents have nothing but praise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Yet it is this man whom the Anglo-Indian papers have been vilifying as a rascally agitator, a braggart, a coward, a “mean specimen of humanity”, whose influence was solely due to his having spent money freely on “agitation”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We can only salute with reverence this fresh exhibition of British fair-play and generosity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>But if the man was such a poor and inconsiderable specimen, how is it that you have treated him as if he were a second Napoleon, thinking even distant Mandalay not remote enough or strong enough to hold the mighty rebel?<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1357"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We have pointed out in previous articles what we considered to be the individual effect of three of the measures of repression adopted by the bureaucracy in their fight with the Swadeshi movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The review has led us to the conclusion that there is so far no new element in the situation beyond, on one<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="376" href="#">1</a> hand, the clear and universal conviction that has been carried home to the people of the nature and extent of the resistance which we may expect from the bureaucracy and, on the other, the more urgent necessity of adopting certain measures for national defence and resistance which ought to have been taken before.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The conditions of the problem have not been materially changed, but its acuteness has been enhanced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The persecution of Swadeshi leaders and workers is nothing new, but it has increased in scale and in the atrocity of the punishments – and it is being carried out not by local officials but by the Government of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The attempt to break the back of the movement by restricting the action of students and teachers is nothing new, but it is now being taken up deliberately, systematically, not by a local administration, but by the Government of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The utilisation by the bureaucracy of Nawab Salimullah and by Nawab<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="377" href="#">2</a> Salimullah of hooligans to harass and, if possible, break the Boycott is nothing new, but the extent to which this sinister opposition has been carried and the wide space of country over which it has been attempted, is a new phenomenon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But there is one measure of the Government which is in itself a new phenomenon and seriously affects, if it does not entirely alter the whole situation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>This is the Coercion Ordinance directed against public meetings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It would not be true to say that the ordinance was absolutely unforeseen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 462</p>
<p class="PE"> We at least had always held it extremely probable if not quite certain, that this and even more violent and crushing methods of coercion would eventually be adopted by the bureaucracy in its struggle for self-preservation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But we did not anticipate so rapid a development of coercive measures, or that they would reach their height, as they threaten to do under a professedly Radical and democratic Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Not that we ever believed there was any essential difference between Liberals and Conservatives with regard to India, but there was a difference in their professions and we imagined that what the Conservatives would do immediately and without compunction, the Liberals would also do, but with hesitation and some show of reluctance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>There has, however, been no slightest sign of reluctance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>With alacrity and a light heart they have refused to India that right of free speech and free meeting which their political creed declares to be a common and fundamental right and to deny which is an act of tyranny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, though not expected so soon, the Coercion Ordinance was not a contingency which had altogether been left out of view.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1358"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>What then is the new condition which it creates?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>One of immense importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Up till now our whole programme with unimportant exceptions has fallen well within the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>We have worked against bureaucratic government, we have not worked against the law nor exceeded its restrictions in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="378" href="#">3</a> any of our methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>So careful have we been in this respect that the bureaucracy have been at a loss where to get a hold on the Swadeshi movement without losing their prestige and reputation, and in the end they have been obliged to throw their reputation overboard and allow the agents of their ally, the Nawab of Dacca, to create disorder so as to prepare the way for proclaiming the Swadeshi areas.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>This desire to keep within the law was not, as some of our disappointed adversaries suggested, born of fear or unwillingness to bear sacrifices for the country – for even without breaking the law many Swadeshi workers had to go to jail or undergo police and Gurkha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="379" href="#">4</a> violence, but part of a well-reasoned policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>To be able to keep within the law gives an immense advantage to a young movement opposed by a strong </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 463</p>
<p class="PE"> adversary in possession of all the machinery of legal repression and oppression; for it allows it to grow into adult strength before giving the enemy a sufficient grasp to strangle it while it is yet immature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Moreover, a nation which can show a respect for law even in the first throes of a revolution, has a better chance of enjoying a stable and successful government of its own when its chance comes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless legality can never be the first consideration in a struggle of the kind we have entered upon, and if new laws are passed which offend against political ethics, which make our service and duty to our country impossible and to obey which would therefore be an unpatriotic act, they cannot possibly command obedience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Still more is this the case when the measure in question is not a law, but an executive ukase which may yet be<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="380" href="#">5</a> prevented from passing into law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This can best be done by a widespread and quiet but determined passive resistance which will make the ukase inoperative without a resort to measures of the most extreme and shameless Russianism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>We have not concealed our opinion that this is the course the country ought to adopt in the present juncture, if for no other reason, then because it is our duty as men, as citizens, as patriots.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1359"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>We recognise, however, that much is yet to be said on the opposite side.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The strongest argument against the course we have suggested, is that the bureaucracy evidently desire an immediate struggle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The course of events at Barisal, the recent outrageous insult to a prominent Swadeshi worker and the insolent harassment of the townspeople by the local officials and their underlings, are extremely significant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The attempt to provoke a struggle between the Hindus and Mahomedans<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="381" href="#">6</a> culminating in the singular affair of the Barisal night panic which still calls for explanation, has been a failure.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>It seems that the police are now attempting to force on some demonstration which will give them an excuse for turning Barisal into a second Rawalpindi.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 464</p>
<p class="PE"> We think that Srijut Satis<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="385" href="#">10</a> Chandra on the whole did well to subordinate his feelings to the good of his country, but the odds were the other way, and the police must have known it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>That in case of resistance even of the most passive kind, the police or military would not “hesitate to shoot”, is extremely probable from the action of the Punjab authorities and the known attitude of the local officials in East Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Would it then be wise for us, it is argued, to expose ourselves passively to the arrest and deportation of our leaders, the dragooning of our towns and villages, the utmost outrages on men and women and all the violent ills of despotic repression, without any certain gain to the country to set in the opposite balance?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The question really turns on the precise strength of the movement at its present stage of growth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>If it is already strong enough to bear extreme Russian repression<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="386" href="#">11</a> without becoming unnerved and demoralised, the course we have suggested is the best, because it is the boldest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>If not, it would be sounder policy perhaps to leave the bureaucracy to its Pyrrhic victory for a while and immediately turn all our energies to giving the movement the necessary strength,– in other words, the necessary organisation of men, money and means which it needs in order to cope with the bureaucracy on equal terms.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The attitude of British statesmen, moreover, is not encouraging even to the Moderates who still think of getting rights marked “Made in Great Britain” in the same consignment with Liverpool salt or Manchester piece-goods.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1381"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The writer of “A Word of Warning” which we publish today has voiced an opinion which we find to be held by several Nationalists who have the success of the movement sincerely at heart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Our correspondent, however, lays himself open to some misinterpretation when he speaks of “the suicidal folly of an unarmed and disorganised nation trying to measure its strength with that of the best-organised power in the land”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The kind of resistance which seems to be suggested here is something in the nature of rebellion and it goes without saying that such resistance for “an unarmed and disorganised nation” would be not merely foolish but physically impossible; an armed revolt without arms is an absurdity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But to measure our strength, in a very different way, with the bureaucracy, however well-organised the latter may be, is the whole purpose and principle of the Nationalist movement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Our position has always been that the potential strength of the people is far greater than the actual strength of the close oligarchy which governs them without regard to their wishes or interests and that this potential strength can only be educated, organised and welded into compactness and coherence by a direct struggle against the antiquated and semi-mediaeval system with which the country is still cursed in this twentieth century, when all other nations “from China to Peru” are busy modernising and humanising their governments and institutions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>In the actual course of the struggle questions will always arise as between rigid applications of principle and concessions to policy and between the contending claims of sheer courage and courage tempered by calculation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>We must remember that throughout the movement the immense advance we have made, is due to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 470</p>
<p class="PE"> the enthusiasm for a great principle and the boldness,– in the opinion of many an almost foolhardy boldness,– with which we have met every fresh crisis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>When the whole of Bengal flung itself into a passionate struggle with the bureaucracy, it was not from any consciousness of strength, for neither the people nor the rulers had any idea of the latent possibilities of political strength in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It was in a moment of uncalculating anger that Bengal took up the policy a few daring spirits suggested and was amazed to find that in doing so it had discovered itself and begun a new era of Indian history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The real point at issue now is whether it will or will not be wise to make a frontal in preference to a flank attack on the coercion ukase.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We have defied an ukase before, but it was then the ukase of local officialdom and of doubtful legality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The present ukase is the deliberate act of the Government of India and the Secretary of State, and its legality is as undoubted as its political immorality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The question therefore is whether we shall persist in carrying on our movement rigidly within the pale of the law, however oppressive the law may be, or follow the example of the Irish and the English Nonconformists by passive resistance to the law itself with a view to bringing about its repeal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The answer really hangs upon the possible next move of the bureaucracy and our preparedness to meet it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>If the bureaucrats try to break our resistance as at Rawalpindi by wholesale arrest, deportation and police and military violence, as well as the still more questionable methods we have seen in operation in East Bengal, shall we still be able to persist, and, if not, what will be our next course?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This is the question which has given pause for a moment to the active prosecution of the Nationalist campaign, since it involves a serious issue of policy which must be settled before concerted action can take place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>For if the ukase is to be passively resisted, the opposition must be offered in concert and ubiquitously.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>A sporadic resistance will be ineffectual and give the advantage to our adversaries.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1382"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>We again repeat that in our opinion the boldest course is the best.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If we thought, as the Anglo-Indian papers affect to think, that the movement was the result of our own efforts, a mere </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 471</p>
<p class="PE"> human creation, we might be of a different opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But throughout we have been conscious that our own efforts and the impulse given or the work done by leading men, whether Moderates or Extremists, have been so small, petty and inefficient that they are absolutely insufficient to explain the extraordinary results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The machinery has been absurdly inadequate, the organisation nil, the means at our disposal pitiably small, the real workers few and mostly obscure, and yet the Indian world has stood amazed and the Anglo-Indian aghast at the vast and incommensurate results of an apparatus so inefficient.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>We believe, therefore, that Divine Power is behind the movement, that the <i>Zeitgeist</i>, the Time-Spirit, is at work to bring about a mighty movement of which the world at the present juncture has need, that that movement is the resurgence of Asia and that the resurgence of India is not only a necessary part of the larger movement but its central need, that India is the keystone of the arch, the chief inheritress of the common Asiatic destiny.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The Mongolian world, preserving the old strong and reposeful civilisation of early Asia, flanks her on the right and has already arisen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The Mahomedan world, preserving the aggressive and militant civilisation of Islam, flanks her on the left and in Egypt, in Arabia, in Persia, is struggling to arise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>In India the two civilisations meet, she is the link between them and must find the note of harmony which will reconcile them and recreate a common Asiatic civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Viewing the movement in this larger light we believe that as its progress and development has been in the past, so it will be in the future above ordinary human calculations, with only one thing certain about it, that no external force can frustrate it and no internal intrigue divert.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Neither John Morley nor Denzil Ibbetson nor Nawab Salimullah, neither false friend nor open enemy, nor even our own mistakes and weakness can come in its way, but rather they are unconsciously helping it on and working for it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>In this belief we are willing to take any risk and meet any expense of our blood and our labour for the great end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>To husband our men or our resources and try to buy liberty in the cheapest market, would be a false and foolish economy.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1383"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>But, subject to this confidence and readiness to throw our all into the gulf, we recognise the necessity of relying on our human judgment to guide us in perplexity, leaving it to the Power behind to make our mistakes as useful, perhaps more useful to the final success than our wiser judgments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>On one thing only we must lay fast hold, on the triple unity of Swadeshi, Boycott and Swaraj.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1424"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Mr. John Morley has committed himself in the House of Commons to a trenchant and unqualified statement that the whole blame for the disturbances in East Bengal lies upon the Hindus who, by a violent and obstreperous boycott attended with coercion and physical force, have irritated the Mahomedans into revolt.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Everyone knows that the statement is untrue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The boycott was no doubt the final cause of the hooliganism in the East just as the Russian revolutionary movement was the final cause of the excesses of the Black Hundred, but it was in no way the immediate and efficient cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It was the final cause in this sense that its first success compelled Sir Bampfylde Fuller to look about for a counteracting influence and he found it in the Nawab of Dacca and the use that could be made of the Nawab’s position to help on a breach between the Mahomedans and Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>That is the whole and sole connection of boycott with the Mymensingh disturbances.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The rest followed by a natural course of evolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Sir Bampfylde favoured the Mahomedans and depressed the Hindus, the Nawab excited his co-religionists against their fellow-countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>There was no concealment about this policy, no pretences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Sir Bampfylde Fuller openly declared that of his two wives the Mahomedan was his favourite and his favouritism was gross, open, palpable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>He flourished it in the face of the public instead of concealing it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The Nawab of Dacca has also openly preached to his co-religionists about the wrongs they have suffered at the hands of the Hindus and called upon them </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>After the disappearance of Sir Bampfylde from the scene of his exploits, the philo-Mahomedanism of the Shillong Government was no longer openly flourished in the face of the public but it was steadily continued in practice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The alliance of Anglo-India with the Nawab was from the beginning made the most of by the <i> Englishman</i> which for some time carried on a very active philo-Mahomedan and anti-Hindu crusade in its columns and did its best to stir up enmity between the two communities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>So there came the first Mymensingh disturbances, the Comilla riots and finally the supreme conflagration that started from Jamalpur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>That conflagration was brought about by Maulavis preaching outrage and plunder in the name of the Nawab of Dacca and the Government, an imputation which the Nawab of Dacca has made no attempt to repudiate, though, it is said, he has been challenged to do so in answer to his hollow professions of a desire to bring about amity between the two communities, while the Shillong Government has repudiated it only tardily and indirectly if at all, and only after the full mischief had been done.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1433"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>It will not be long now before the Colleges open and the students begin to return to Calcutta; the moment they come the struggle for the possession of the youth of the country must begin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy has thrown out the challenge and there is every sign that it will be taken up.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Men of all parties, except the party of Mr. N. N. Ghose which, as it consists of only one man, need not concern us, are agreed that to acquiesce in the Circular is out of the question.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If there is any difference of opinion, it is as to the best method of defying it, and that is not a matter of primary importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>For our own part, we have expressed ourselves in favour of an educational strike, because that is the most straightforward, the most masculine and the most aggressive form of passive resistance of which the occasion allows.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We hold that in order to rise the nation must get into the habit of offering challenges rather than receiving them and when it is behind, it must take the swiftest and most direct form of demonstration open to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Passive resistance can be carried on in an inert and passive spirit of mechanical reaction against pressure from above, or it may be carried on in an active and creative spirit, it may take the initiative instead of being driven; it may assail the citadels of the enemy instead of merely defending its own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>What India needs especially at this moment is the aggressive virtues, the spirit of soaring idealism, bold creation, fearless resistance, courageous attack; of the passive tamasic spirit of inertia we have already too much.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We need to cultivate another training and temperament, another habit of mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We would apply to the present situation the vigorous motto of Danton, that what we need, what we should learn above all things is to dare and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 488</p>
<p class="PE"> again to dare and still to dare.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1434"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless we recognise that to leap at once from an over-poweringly tamasic condition of mind into the rajasic, the active, restless, bold and creative, is not easy for a nation and if we cannot have the best method, we will accept the second best, so long as the principle of resistance is maintained.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>A general defiance of the Circular will obviously make it unworkable, unless the Government is prepared to disaffiliate schools and Colleges freely and give up its control of education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It is possible, of course, that they may do so in the hope of bringing the country to its knees by drawing home the conviction that it cannot take in hand its own education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But this will be a dangerous game to play; for the only thing that is needed to make the institution of a widespread and comprehensive system of national education possible and indeed eminently practicable, is the generation of an enthusiasm such as was beginning to gather force after the Carlyle Circular.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>A stern and bitter struggle between the people and the bureaucracy is the one thing that is likely to generate such an enthusiasm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>National education is by no means impracticable or even difficult, it needs nothing but a resolute enthusiasm in the country and the courage to take a leap into the unknown.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>This courage is common in individuals but not in nations, least of all in subject nations; and yet when the fire is lit, it is perhaps subject nations more than any other which are found ready to take the leap.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1435"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>We do not believe the bureaucracy will be willing to drive matters to such a crisis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It is more likely that they will use the Circular to harass the opposition and overcome our resistance by instituting measures of petty persecution wherever they can do it without upheaving the whole foundation of the educational system in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>All that is demanded from us is therefore a persistent resolution to make the Circular unworkable regardless of loss and sacrifice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We must take every opportunity of challenging the Circular and testing the resolution of the bureaucracy and the campaign must be carried on simultaneously all over Bengal, if not in other parts of India as well.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But it is Calcutta which must give the signal.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We were one of the recipients of the Bengal Government’s letter, and if we have not written on the subject, it is simply because the letter was marked confidential.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Now, however, that the matter has got abroad, we may as well correct certain inaccuracies which have appeared not only in the <i>Statesman</i>’s bit of romancing, but in the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i>’s correction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is entirely untrue that on Monday afternoon or any other afternoon, evening or morning “a notice was served upon the proprietors, editor, manager and printer of this paper to the effect that proceedings would be adopted against them under section 124A and the other sections dealing with seditious publications, unless they moderated their tone”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>On Saturday before last, if our memory serves us, we received a communication from the Bengal Government addressed to the Editor, <i>Bande Mataram</i>, in which we were informed that the Lieutenant-Governor had had under consideration certain articles (not specified) recently published in our paper “the language of which was a direct incitement to violence and breach of the peace”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>This sort of language the Bengal Government was determined to put a stop to, but before taking action they were gracious enough to give us a warning to mend our ways.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>That is all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is not true either that a conference was held with the directors or that the manager<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="421" href="#">1</a> interviewed the legal </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 516</p>
<p class="PE"> advisers of the Company in connection with the notice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>No such conference or interview was held for the simple reason that none was necessary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The Editorial Department is solely responsible for the policy of the paper and they have no need to consult lawyers about their duty to the public.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i> is therefore wrongly informed when it says that legal opinion has been taken and given in the matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It is true that legal opinion is being taken by the Company, but it is on a point of law which arose previous to the receipt of the Bengal Government’s letter and is entirely unconnected with it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The <i> Statesman</i> has also absurdly distorted the “proceedings against the <i> Yugantar</i> and <i>Nabasakti</i>”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>No proceedings have been instituted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The police while searching the Keshab Press for manuscripts in connection with the pamphlet <i>Sonar Bangla</i> – which has, by the way, no connection with the Hare<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="422" href="#">2</a> Street mare’s nest – stumbled on the forms of the <i>Yugantar</i> then being printed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The Keshab Press is being proceeded against, but it is doubtful whether anything will be done to the <i>Yugantar</i>, as the printing of a paper in part or whole at another press in emergency is so common an occurrence that, even if it be a technical offence, which is not certain, to prosecute it would be purely vindictive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>In any case the <i>Yugantar</i> business is not, as the <i> Statesman</i> represents, the first step in a campaign against the Nationalist Press.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Our own position is very simple.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The articles to which the Bengal Government refers, are, we presume, those in which we called upon the Hindus to defend their temples and their women from insult and outrage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Every Hindu paper at the time did the same, even the <i>Indian Mirror</i> and the <i>Indian Nation</i>, and we do not think we did anything more than our plain duty to our countrymen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The Lieutenant-Governor, however, takes exception not to the purport of our articles but to their language – which was less violent than what English papers would have used if a similar campaign of outrage on European women had been in progress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Be that as it may, the occasion has passed and until it is repeated, the question of complying or not complying with the warning does not arise.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1510"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>There has been much to edify and instruct in the recent antics of the bureaucracy and, in the light of the object lessons they present, the people of India have been revising old ideas and outworn superstitions with a healthy rapidity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The belief in British liberalism, in the freedom of the Press, in the freedom of the platform, in the Pax Britannica, in the political honesty of Mr. John Morley and many other cherished shibboleths have departed into the limbo of forgotten follies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>But the greatest fall of all has been the fall of the belief in the imperturbable impartiality of British justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>There are two kinds of strain which no empire, however firmly bound in triple and quadruple bands of steel, can long bear; the strain of a burden of taxation which the people no longer find bearable and the strain of a series of perversions of justice which destroy all faith in the motives of the governing authorities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Justice and protection between man and man, between community and community, between rulers and ruled is the main object for which States exist, for which men submit to the restrictions of the law and to an equitable assessment of the expenses of the machinery which provides for protection and justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But if the assessment of the expenses is grossly unjust, if the expenses themselves are exorbitantly high, if the revenue is spent on ways of which the taxpayers do not approve, then protection and justice are bought at a price which is not worth paying.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>And if in addition the protection is denied and the justice withheld, then the very object of the existence of a State ceases to be satisfied and from that moment the governing power, unless it can retrace its steps, is doomed by the inevitable operation of nature.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE">The bureaucrats who misgovern us at the present moment have totally forgotten these simple truths.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Otherwise we would not have witnessed such scandalous scenes as are now being enacted at Rawalpindi or the gross infringements of equity and justice which are of frequent occurrence in Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The amazing incidents of the Rawalpindi riot case are such as have hardly been paralleled in British India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The refusal of bail, which was the first scandal, has evidently become a part of bureaucratic policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is a sound principle of procedure that bail should not be refused except under exceptional conditions, such as the probability of the accused absconding, otherwise in a protracted case an innocent man may suffer seriously for the sole offence of being accused.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>In the Rawalpindi case there was not the least possibility of men like Lala Hansraj, Gurdas Ram or Janaki Nath absconding from justice and the apprehension of further riots in a city commanded by siege-guns and crowded with military was a contemptible and hollow pretence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Yet without hearing the case, on the mere statement of the prosecuting officials, the Chief Court of the Punjab, supposed to be the highest repository of impartial British Justice, prejudged the accused, declared them guilty and refused bail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This is British law and British justice!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Again in the course of the present trial, although it was proved beyond dispute that the prisoners were suffering terribly in health as the result of a detention in which they are being deliberately subjected to unnecessary discomfort and privation, although, if there was ever any shadow of justification for the refusal of bail, even that shadow had by this time utterly vanished, yet on the strength of the airy persiflage of a Civil Surgeon the relief to which they were entitled was refused.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>This gentleman held the view that the sufferings of the accused were not due to their detention and seems to be of the opinion that men of means and gentle nurture are rather in the habit of shedding several pounds of flesh off and on without apparent cause.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>And so the unfortunate martyrs, for the crime of being patriots, are punished with a long term of imprisonment before any offence has been proved against them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>This too is British law and British justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>From the point <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> of view of the executive it may no doubt be said that since the accused have to be punished whether they are guilty or innocent, it does not much matter whether their punishment begins before or after their conviction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>That is good reasoning from the point of view of a bureaucratic executive, but not from that of a judicial authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The refusal of bail to the Rawalpindi pleaders is one of the most deadly of the many wounds which the bureaucracy have been recently dealing to their own moral prestige and reputation for justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The same spirit has been shown in the refusal of bail to Pindi Das, editor of <i>India</i>, and to Lala Dinanath of the <i>Hindustan</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In the latter case there is absolutely no excuse whatever for the refusal, except the vindictive fury of bureaucratic persecution which will omit no means however petty and base to make its opponents suffer.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1512"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But the most glaringly, paradoxically unsound case of all has occurred in our own midst.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Srijut Girindranath Sen received at the hands of British justice a sentence of monstrous severity for a trifling offence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This same British justice being moved to set aside the conviction and sentence, was graciously pleased to give the accused a chance of disproving the offence, but at the same time, in the plenitude of its justice and wisdom, refused to give him bail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>In other words it admitted that the accused might be innocent, but at the same time decided that he must undergo a monstrously disproportionate punishment for a trifling offence of which it was admittedly doubtful whether he ever committed it!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>And then when the punishment had been served out, British justice lent a gracious and leisurely ear and admitted that this Swadeshi Volunteer Captain was very probably innocent, but as he had suffered punishment for his innocence, it was not necessary to go any further into the matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>This too is British law and British justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>If all this does not convince the Indian people that the British sense of justice is most marvellous and unique and <i> sui generis</i> and without any peer or parallel in the world, it must indeed be hard-hearted and dull of soul.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The opprobrious term of mendicancy was applied to the old Congress school of politics not because remonstrance and protest are in themselves wrong and degrading, but because in the circumstances of modern India a policy of prayer, petition and protest without the sanction of a great irresistible national force at its back was bound to pauperise the energy of the nation and to accustom it to a degrading </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 525</p>
<p class="PE"> dependence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It was not only a waste of energy but a sapping of energy, and it was ruinous to manhood and self-respect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>But the recognition of this fact only led to another problem.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If we did not sue to others for help, we must help ourselves; if we did not depend on the alien’s mercies, we must depend on our own strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But how was that strength to be educated?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Again, when we had decided that a subject nation has no politics, what then?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Were we to renounce the birthrights inherent in our manhood and leave the field to the bureaucratic despotism or were we to resolve to cease to be a subject nation so that we might recover the right and possibility of political life and activity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>There were two currents of political thought growing up in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>One, thoughtful, philosophic, idealistic, dreamed of ignoring the terrible burden that was crushing us to death, of turning away from politics and educating our strength in the village and township, developing our resources, our social, economic, religious life regardless of the intrusive alien; it thought of inaugurating a new revolution such as the world had never yet seen, a moral, peaceful revolution, actively developing ourselves but only passively resisting the adversary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>But there was another current submerged as yet, but actively working underneath, which tended in another direction,– a sprinkling of men in whom one fiery conviction replaced the cultured broodings of philosophy and one grim resolve took the place of political reasoning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The conviction was that subjection was the one curse which withered and blighted all our national activities, that so long as that curse was not removed it was a vain dream to expect our national activities to develop themselves successfully and that only by struggle could our strength be educated to action and victory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The resolve was to rise and fight and fall and again rise and fight and fall waging the battle for ever until this once great and free nation should again be great and free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It was this last current which boiled up to the surface in the first vehemence of the anti-Partition agitation, flung out the challenge of boycott and plunged the Bengali nation into a struggle with the bureaucracy which must now be fought out till the end.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1528"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>All were carried away in the tide of that great upheaval; </p>

<p class="PE"> but it is needless to say that this was not what the advocates of self-help pure and simple had contemplated, Mr. Chaudhuri<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="434" href="#">11</a> least of all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>He very early identified himself with the small knot of older leaders who from time to time struggled with the tide and tried to turn it back; but until now the tide was too strong for them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>For a moment, however, the rush has been checked by superhuman efforts of repression on the part of the panic-stricken bureaucracy and it is natural that those who were not with their whole heart and conviction for the struggle for Swaraj, should begin to revert to their old ideas, to long to give up the struggle, to retreat into the fancied security of their fortress of unpolitical Swadeshism and a policy of self-help which seeks to ignore the unignorable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The tendency is to cry, “The old policy is a failure, the Briton has revealed his true nature; the new policy is a failure, we have not strength to meet the giant power of the bureaucracy; let them<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="435" href="#">12</a> have the field, let us quietly pursue our own salvation in the peaceful Ashrams of Swadeshism and self-help.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Mr. Ashutosh Chaudhuri<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="436" href="#">13</a> with his keen intellectual sensitiveness has felt this tendency in the air and given it expression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>It is a beautiful and pathetic dream.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We will develop our manufacture, boycott foreign goods, of course in a quite friendly and non-political spirit, and England will look quietly on while its trade is being ruined!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>We will ignore the Government and build up our own centres of strength in spite of it, a Government the whole principle and condition of whose existence is that there shall be no centre of strength in the country except itself!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Mr. Chaudhuri’s<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="437" href="#">14</a> policy would be an excellent one if he could only remove two factors from the political problem, first, Indian Nationalism, secondly, the British Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>And how does he propose to remove them?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>By shutting his eyes to their existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Ignore the Government, dissociate yourselves from the men of violence – and the thing is done.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1538"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We commented the other day on the policy of refusing bail which has recently been adopted by the bureaucracy in a spirit of petty vindictiveness and the scandalous manner in which men accused of political offences are being punished before conviction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Of course it is all under the law, but that only proves the contention we have always advanced that the criminal law in this country on which our rulers pride themselves, is barbarous, oppressive and semi-mediaeval in its spirit and that its provisions are governed far more by the principle of repressing the spirit of the people than by the principle of protecting the citizen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Moreover, in all judicial administration there are two elements, the letter of the law on one side, a humane and equitable practice on the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>To suspend the latter in favour of the former shows an oppressive and tyrannical spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The letter of the law enables the Government to appeal against any and every acquittal in a criminal case; equitable practice forbids it to take advantage of this barbarous provision except in important cases where it is convinced there has been a serious miscarriage of justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But the first principle of bureaucratic rule in India is repression, to crush the spirit of the people and keep them down with the strong hand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Every acquittal is therefore considered by the executive a defeat to Government prestige and resented.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Unless therefore there is a strong and independent High Court, the habit of appealing against acquittals is bound to become a standing feature of British justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But the idea of a strong and independent High Court is becoming more and more a legend of the past.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Future generations will be as sceptical of the possibility of its ever having existed as the modern world is of the existence of gnomes and fairies.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1539"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 529</p>
<p class="PE">There is another equitable practice which has been violated with the most cynical openness in the Rawalpindi trial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It is a sound principle of legal procedure that the accused should not be hampered in his defence but on the contrary should receive every legitimate facility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The unjust judge who denies proper facilities of defence to a man whose life or liberty, honour or reputation is imperilled by an accusation which may be false or mistaken, the hanging judge whose diseased brain and morbid temperament are consumed with the desire to have the accused convicted, are survivals of mediaeval barbarity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Such men are the lineal descendants of Jeffreys and Torquemada.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>In England such men are rarities upon the Bench; in India especially among Civilian Magistrates and Judges, they are not uncommon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>In England the prosecuting Counsel will seldom throw unnecessary difficulties in the way of the defence, in India it is too common for the prosecuting Counsel to regard the defence as an enemy to be beaten down and out-manoeuvred by any means which the technicalities of the law leave open to him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>For the atmosphere is different.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The spirit of bureaucracy in all countries tends to be narrow, hard and domineering, but in a country where a small alien element subsists in a huge native mass partly by the maintenance of a hypnotic illusion, partly by a cold legal repressive severity, ubiquitous and watchful to crush down every least unit of strength in the indigenous population, this temper is immensely heightened and exaggerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Everybody knows that in the local administration of the law in this country conviction, not impartial justice, is the object.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>A Subordinate Magistrate is rated not by the soundness of his judgments but by the percentage of convictions to the total number of cases he has tried, and it is by this test that he is promoted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>In that single fact we find the true and fundamental tendency of British justice in India.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1540"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>When such is the spirit even in the ordinary administration of the law, it can easily be imagined to what lengths this spirit of semi-mediaeval barbarity is likely to be carried when political considerations are imported.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>To get justice in a Swadeshi case is nowadays almost impossible; even in the High Court only one or two judges have managed to keep a judicial frame of </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 530</p>
<p class="PE"> mind in relation to political cases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This is of course natural and inevitable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>A struggle is going on between the ruling bureaucracy and the people of the country, and every judge or magistrate is a servant of the bureaucracy, generally a member of it and very often himself one of the caste and race whose monopoly of power is threatened.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>In his eyes the accused in a political case is not an ordinary accused but a rebel prisoner of war; he may not be guilty of the offence with which he is charged, but he is guilty of Swadeshism, he is guilty of being an opponent of the Government established by law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>His punishment is therefore desirable in the interests of the ruling class and in the judge’s own interests as a servant and member of that class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The judge is really a party to the case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is not to be expected that in such circumstances any facilities will be allowed to the defence beyond what the letter of the law and bare decency require.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>A few magistrates may rise superior to these considerations, but the majority cannot be reasonably asked to do so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>They are after all human beings – and Englishmen.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1541"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Still there is a limit, there is something due to decency, and at Rawalpindi it seems to us that the limit has been overpassed and the dues have been denied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We have nothing to say as to the guilt or the innocence of the men under trial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>We will assume that they are guilty, we will assume that their conviction is a thing settled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>But still until the trial is over, they are in law regarded as men who are possibly innocent and should be allowed ordinary facilities to prove their innocence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>One of the principal safeguards of accused innocents<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="441" href="#">1</a> in India is the necessity of identification under stringent rules which prevent collusion between the police and the witnesses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>In the Rawalpindi trial it has been repeatedly stated that the identification has been a scandalous farce; the prisoners have been under police custody all the time and have been repeatedly shown to the witnesses in the jail, and as if this were not enough, the police in Court are allowed to make signs to the witnesses so that they may be sure to identify the right persons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>These statements have not been denied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>They may be true or they may be false; but when such statements are advanced by the defence, it is the duty of an impartial judge to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 531</p>
<p class="PE"> inquire into them and take every precaution against the barest possibility of such practices.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Piteous complaints have been made by several of the accused of police violence and cruelty in <i>hajat</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>Into this also no inquiry has been made and the only answer the unfortunate men have received is a rough and uncivil command to keep silence.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1542"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>If this were all, it would be scandalous enough, but the recent developments have been still more staggering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>A hooligan crusade has been started against the pleaders for the defence, so shamelessly persistent and open as to drive them to throw up their briefs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Sirdar Beant Singh’s house has been invaded, himself and his brother brutally assaulted, his ladies’ apartments entered and an ornament snatched from the person of his wife.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>While these brutal outrages were being committed, the police remained quiet in their <i>thana</i> which is in the same compound as the Sirdar’s house and made no attempt to give assistance, nor do we hear of any attempt to trace and punish the miscreants.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The houses of other defence pleaders have been exposed to a campaign of theft and pilfering and none of them is safe against a repetition of the kind of intimidation which has been used against Beant Singh.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>All India has drawn its own conclusions from these singular occurrences, for indeed, the conclusions are not difficult to draw.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1543"><!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>But the crowning scandal of all was the treatment of the witness Abdullah.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>It is possible that seditious speeches were delivered by the accused, but it is certain that the amazing literal unanimity of the witnesses has created, rightly or wrongly, an impression that their evidence was given according to police dictation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>When, therefore, a Mahomedan witness actually declared in the witness box that his first evidence has been given under fear of the police, it was obvious that the whole foundation of the prosecution case was threatened; for the example of recantation might easily be followed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Then ensued a scene which we hope, for the credit of humanity at large, has never had a parallel in recent judicial history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>Immediately the prosecuting counsel leaps up and demands that this inconvenient witness be at once prosecuted for perjury and handed over to the tender mercies </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 532</p>
<p class="PE"> of the police against whom he has given evidence; immediately the judge complies with this amazing demand; immediately the unfortunate witness is hustled out of court into the grip of the police.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>It is not surprising that the miserable Abdullah should recant his recantation and balance his charge against the police by a charge against the leading pleader for the defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>And this too is British law and British justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>Nay, it is the climax, the apex, the acme, the culminating point which British justice has reached in this too fortunate country.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Wholesale deportation, arbitrary imprisonment, massacre, outrage, police anarchy, torture of prisoners, every familiar feature of Russian repression, can be brought under the head of weapons necessary to combat sedition and can be justified by the plea of State necessity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This is the danger of reason of State, a danger that recent events in India and especially current events in the Punjab show to be by no means so remote as we might have some months ago imagined.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But the danger of sedition is the cessation of British rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>And in the opinion of Mr. Morley, supported by an almost unanimous consensus of British opinion, the reenactment by a British government of the iniquities and atrocities of ancient and modern tyranny are preferable to the cessation of British rule; it is better to take the risk of these than to take the risk of losing the absolute control of Britain over India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This is Mr. Morley’s argument, approved by Conservative and Radical alike.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Not the British connexion, not the continuance of India as a self-governing unit in a federation of free peoples which shall be called the British Empire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>No, Mr. Morley is quite as hostile to the Moderate ideal of self-government on colonial lines, modified Swaraj, as to the Nationalist ideal of Swaraj pure and simple.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The educated minority in India have the presumption to think themselves capable of working the government of the country as smoothly as the heaven-born Briton himself, but Mr. Morley is persuaded that they would not work it for a week.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>This is final.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If after a hundred years of English education and no inconsiderable training in the subordinate conduct of the bureaucratic machinery of government, the educated class are not fit to be entrusted even by gradual stages with the supreme government of Indian affairs, then they will never be fit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>And we must remember that the policy </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 535</p>
<p class="PE"> of the rulers henceforth will be to control and restrict and not to encourage or promote the spread of education of the higher sort.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>From our own point of view, we may put it more strongly and say that if a hundred years of dependence and foreign control have so immensely impaired that governing capacity of the Indian races which they showed with such splendid results for the last three thousand years, then another century will absolutely and for ever destroy it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley is therefore logically justified in reiterating his conviction that personal and absolute foreign control must be the leading feature of Indian administration to the very end of time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>This is what Mr. Morley means by the continuance of British rule, he means the continuance of a personal and absolute British control pervading the administration of affairs in every department, in other words, a bureaucratic despotism strongly flavoured by the independent personal omnipotence of local governors and local officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The problem which former British statesmen professed to have before them was the problem of gradually training and associating the Indians in an European system of government until they were fit to take over absolute control of affairs and allow their patrons and protectors to withdraw.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>This problem does not any longer trouble the peace of British statesmen; on the contrary it is definitely and for ever disclaimed and put aside as a chimera – or a pretence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>British rule in India will continue, ought to continue and must continue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>What then is the problem which is troubling Mr. Morley?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The problem is “the difficulty of combining personal government in our dependency with the rights of free speech and free meeting”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Personal government, absolute government, despotism, that is the supreme necessity which must be continued for ever even at the sacrifice of morality, justice and every other consideration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Subject to that necessity Mr. Morley proposes to allow a certain amount of free speech if that be possible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>Free speech was harmless so<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="442" href="#">1</a> long as the Indian people had not set their heart on self-government; but now that they are<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="443" href="#">2</a> resolved to have nothing short of self-government, free speech means seditious speech, and sedition is not consistent with the continuance of the absolute and personal British control.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>How can fire and water occupy the same space?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>That is the problem, which Mr. Morley refuses to believe insoluble, and he solves it by proclaiming the areas where free speech has been chiefly employed,– and by establishing an Advisory Council of Notables.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1549"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It may be asked, if the continuance of absolute government is the whole policy of British statesmanship, why does Mr. Morley trouble himself about free speech at all or propose any reforms?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>That question can be easily answered by a consideration of the suggested reforms.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>The first of these reforms is a Council of Notables.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley has told us what is the object of this body; it is to be a sort of medium of communication between the Government and the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Of course Mr. Morley is quite mistaken in supposing that such a body can really serve the object he has in view, but we are concerned for the present not with the sufficiency of the means he is devising for his object, but with the object itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>The second reform is an expansion of the Legislative Councils and greater facilities to the elected members for the expression of their views; in other words the object of the expanded Legislative Councils is to keep the Government in India in touch with the views of the educated class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>The third reform is the admission of Indian members to the India Council, and it is obvious that here again the object is that these Indian members should keep the Government in England in touch with the opinions of educated India, just as the elected members of the Legislative Councils<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="444" href="#">3</a> are to keep the Government in India in touch with the same opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>The fourth reform is the decentralisation of the administration so that each local official may become an independent local despot.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>The object is clearly defined; first, to give him greater opportunities of being in touch with the people, secondly, to give him a greater power of personal despotic control within his own jurisdiction unhampered by the interference of higher authorities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>All the reforms have one single object, one governing idea,– an absolute personal despotic British control <i>in touch with the people</i>.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>The object is quite different.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>A despotism out of touch with the people is a despotism continually in danger; ignorant of the currents of opinion, ignorant of the half-visible activities among its subjects, ignorant of the perils gathering in the vast obscurity, it must one day be suddenly surprised and perhaps overthrown by the unforeseen outburst of activities and dangers it had not anticipated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>It is in order to avoid these dangers that Mr. Morley wishes to employ various means of keeping in touch with public opinion and its manifestations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>He talks in his speech of the necessity of the rulers putting themselves in the skins of the ruled, in other words, of thoroughly understanding their thoughts, feelings and point of view.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>This does not mean that they shall rule India according to the sentiments, views and wishes of the Indian people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>The whole conduct of Mr. Morley and the whole trend of his utterances show<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="445" href="#">4</a> that he means the opinions of the Government to prevail without regard to Indian opinions and sentiments.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_59"><!-- --></a>The rulers are to understand the ruled so that they may know how their measures are likely to affect the minds of the latter, how opposition can best be persuaded or <i>samjaoed</i> into quiescence and how, if persuasion is useless, it can most swiftly and successfully be crushed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_60"><!-- --></a>Through the Council of Notables, the Legislative Councils and the Indian members of the India Council, the Government will come to know the ideas, views and feelings of the people; through the two former bodies they will try to present unpopular measures in such a way as to coax, cajole, delude or intimidate public opinion into a quiet acceptance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_61"><!-- --></a>If they cannot do this, then through the decentralised local officers they can keep in touch with the popular temper, learn its manifestations and activities and successfully and promptly put down opposition by local measures, if possible, otherwise by imperial rescripts, laws and ordinances and every possible weapon of despotic repression.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1551"><!--SENT--><a name="s_62"><!-- --></a>We have analysed Mr. Morley’s speech at length, because people in India have not the habit of following the turns of British parliamentary eloquence or reading between the lines of </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We on the contrary believe, and that according to the best authority, that the patriotism which has hitherto wrested from Mr. Morley only an expanded Council with an official majority and a comic advisory Board of Notables, falls far short of the standard of lexicographers.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">The Secret Springs of Morleyism</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1581"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The apostasy of John Morley has come as a surprise and a scandal to that numerous class of believers in British professions who looked upon him as an <i>avatar</i> of the spirit of philosophic Liberalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>To those who had studied the man at closer quarters there was no disappointment and no surprise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>As the <i>Kesari</i> pointed out in the early days of his administration, the new Secretary of State might be a philosopher and defend human liberties in his books, but in the India Office he was bound to be a British statesman first of all and defend the continuance of British supremacy in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But apart from this the whole temper of Mr. Morley’s mind and the cast of his opinions made it quite certain that he would never be able to sympathise with the aspirations of our people and their claims to self-government and autonomy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It is true that Mr. Morley talks about the necessity of sympathy as the mainspring of Indian administration, but what is the nature of this sympathy?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>What Mr. Morley calls sympathy is not really sympathy but the patronising benevolence of the master possessed of absolute powers of life and death who is generous enough to give his bondslave as much education as is good for him: in the process of that education he tries to be as indulgent as possible while reserving his right to scourge him occasionally for his own good and of course to appropriate all the profits of his labour for the master’s own purse.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The object of the education given to the slave is not to fit him for freedom but to make him a more useful servant and one whose appearance and manners shall reflect credit on the master.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Needless to say, this is not sympathy but a very undesirable form of arrogance and selfishness masquerading as benevolence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>True sympathy means </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 549</p>
<p class="PE"> “putting oneself in another’s skin”, understanding and appreciating his view of things, his feelings, hopes and aspirations and feeling his struggles and sufferings as one’s own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>This is the true liberal sentiment, the true liberal enthusiasm which men like Mr. Hyndman feel but which is extremely rare in the so-called Liberal party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley never had this sentiment and enthusiasm, he had only a cold philosophic conviction of the truth of the Liberal view of politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>This conviction depended on a keen intellectual appreciation of the materialistic, agnostic, scientific enlightenment of modern Europe and the governing ideas of the nineteenth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But the very keenness of this appreciation makes it utterly impossible for Mr. Morley and men like him to understand and sympathise with Asiatics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>To them Asia is a home of monstrous religions, barbarous despotisms, grotesque superstitions and a primitive morality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>That this half-civilised continent contains peoples as capable of self-government as any European race is a thing which they cannot persuade themselves to believe, Japan not withstanding.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Japan has shown that Asiatic civilisation is equal and in some important respects superior to European, needing only to be modernised and equipped with the mental and material processes invented by European science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>She has proved that the capacity Asiatics have shown in organising society and politics under old conditions can be diverted with admirable results to the reorganisation of society and politics under modern conditions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But to minds of the Morley type Japan only presents itself as a freak or an inexplicable exception.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The world of Liberalism and enlightenment to which alone liberal philosophy is applicable and in which alone liberal institutions can flourish, is the world of Europe and America which has inherited the legacy of Rome and Greece, of Christianity and rationalistic thought and science.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Asia stands outside that charmed enclosure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1582"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>That this is the mental attitude of Mr. John Morley is shown by the use which he has made of a certain passage from Mill: “Government by a dominant country is as legitimate as any other if it is one which in the existing state of the civilisation of the subject people most facilitates their transition to our state </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 550</p>
<p class="PE"> of civilisation.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Now, it is obvious that the case which Mill had in mind was that of a civilisation so inferior that the people possessing it had no capacity to raise themselves or to assimilate for themselves the essentials of a new organization and must be gradually trained up by foreigners; his dictum can have no reference to a great and living civilization like the civilizations of China, Japan and India which have understood and practised organization and self-adaptation to surrounding circumstances for thousands of years and have developed a highly intellectual and ingenious people quick to understand, to imitate and to improve.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Japan has reorganized herself without the blessings of foreign rule, China is doing the same, and there is no reason to suppose that there is any constitutional defect in the Indian people which would prevent them from following the example if the alien incubus were removed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In none of these cases would foreign rule facilitate the transition to a modern organization of politics and society; in India it has distinctly retarded it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But the very fact that Mr. Morley applies Mill’s dictum to India shows his inability to appreciate Asiatic civilization, character and capacity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>He cannot and will not believe that Asiatics can ever be on a level with Europeans or capable of equalling and surpassing them in their own arts and sciences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>His view of them is the view of Rudyard Kipling; they are the white man’s burden, the lower races, half devil and half child.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This attitude of Mr. Morley’s is the ingrained, unalterable European sentiment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The rise of Japan is to the European a thing monstrous, incredible, unrealisable; he makes friends with the monster because he has seen its strength, but in his secret heart he chafes and rages against it as a thing intolerable and out of nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>He is prepared to use any and every means to crush Asiatic aspirations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Morality and humanity are meant to be employed in dealing with Asiatics just as much but no more than in dealing with the animal creation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>There can be no European respect for Asiatics, no sympathy between them except the “sympathy” of the master for the slave, no peace except that which is won and maintained by the Asiatic sword.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>East is East and West is West and divided they shall remain; their temporary contact is decreed from time <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="1.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="5.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> to time so that each may take from the other’s civilisation, but the interchange does not bring them nearer to each other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Those who like Mr. Krishnaswamy Aiyar think that because Europe will take much of India’s religion and philosophy, therefore she will learn to love and respect the Indian people, forget that Europe adopted a modified Judaism as her religion, yet hated, despised and horribly persecuted the Jews.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>European prejudice will always refuse to regard Asiatics as anything but an inferior race and European selfishness will always deny their fitness to enjoy the rights of men until the inevitable happens and Asia once more spews Europe out of her mouth.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We need not trouble about the choleric effusions with a daily output of which Anglo-Indian writers nowadays provide their readers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>But apart from the natural unhinging of the reason for which the prospect of loss of power and prestige or of trade is responsible, there is a plentiful lack of appreciation of the nature of the movement, its causes and probable effects not only on the part of the ruling class but of the majority of our educated people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We can understand the ruling class doing their very best to crush the movement out of self-interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But it is none the less our duty to return good for evil and try our best to enlighten their intellectual haziness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is from the want of a true perception of the nature of the movement that much of the misunderstanding and irritation has proceeded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>And in trying to present it in its true bearing we have not been guided by any individual notions of our own but the decisions and findings of master-minds on the success of all spiritual movements.<!--/SENT--></p>

Taine gives the same explanation of the success of Rousseau and Voltaire in influencing the minds of the French people, though there were Montesquieu with a sort of historic method, Turgot and the school of the economists and, what is more, seventy thousand of the secular clergy and sixty thousand of the regular clergy, ever proclaiming by life or exhortation ideas of peace, submission and a kingdom not of this world.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Naturally these features are precisely those which their age and their race happen to be in a condition to understand.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1605"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The curious struggle in the South of France which is being waged between the vine-growing population of the South and the Government in Paris, has not yet come to a conclusion.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 560</p>
<p class="PE"> The cause of the pother seems to be hardly proportionate to the results.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The wine-trade in the south of France is on the decline because the French people are taking to other and cheaper beverages, and the vine-growers demand State protection and encouragement for their industry, which the French Government has not denied but has been somewhat dilatory in arranging.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The population of southern France are hot, excitable, unstable and, being all more or less affected – for the vine is <i>the</i> chief produce there – have been exasperated by the neglect into something like rebellion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>This is all that from this distance one can understand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The interest of the outbreak for us lies in the fact that it began with a huge passive resistance movement very much on the lines we have advocated in India, the object being to paralyze the Government and the chief weapon the voluntary resignation of the Municipalities which are indispensable instruments of administration in France.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately a fair chance was not given to the experiment which should have been one of the most interesting in human history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>With the arrival of the Military the movement passed into a queer amalgam of passive resistance, military mutiny and popular revolt; the leaders took fright, surrendered or bolted to Paris, wept at the feet of ministers and returned to advise their followers to weep and surrender along with them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The whole business is somewhat farcical and extremely French.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>At any rate the hot French nature, impatient and incapable of endurance, found it impossible to continue the experiment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Perhaps passive resistance is in itself too much not only for French nature but for human nature generally; perhaps it is always bound to pass into active resistance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But this cannot be decided until it is given a fair trial by a more politic, patient and enduring race than the Frenchmen of the south.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile we note that the French Government has hastily passed the more urgent clauses of the Bill for assisting the wine industry.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The discovery that superior culture has not destroyed the primitive savage in the Anglo-Saxon, has been welcomed with fierce gratification.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>One English paper writes: – “It was a healthy sign to which the attention of native sedition-mongers may be usefully directed that the House of Commons which gave an appreciative reception to the speech of the Secretary of State showed impatience at the captious and mischievous vapourings of Mr. C.

<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Well, but why draw attention to it?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We have been arguing the same thing from the very beginning of our propaganda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We were among the first to point out to a too credulous nation that the friends of India in Parliament represented nobody but themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It was one of the principal items on the destructive side of the Nationalist programme, to prove the delusiveness of the prevalent faith in the ultimate sense of justice of the British people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>If the House of Commons saves us the trouble of farther argument and itself conclusively proves the soundness of our reasoning, we accept its assistance with gratitude but without surprise.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> the Indian mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>To warn us that the highly illiberal speech of Mr. Morley struck a responsive chord in every bosom in the House, is therefore labour wasted.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>They may go into ecstasies over the speech of Morley, or they may gnash their teeth at the vapourings of O’Donnell; we in India are no longer affected by their frown or by their smile.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>We have to improvise our own means of meeting the Regulation <i>lathi</i> and other bureaucratic means of repression and we neither hope for nor desire its mitigation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The legend of British sympathy misled us for a century and now that the phantasm has of itself ceased to haunt us, let no one try to juggle and deceive us again with the <i>mantras</i> of that modern black art.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Both Mr. Morley’s speech and its effect on the British people are, we repeat, matters of supreme indifference to us, and the British and Anglo-Indian journals who want to frighten us into our old mendicant attitude by trumpeting the “sensible and resolute speech” of Mr. Morley and the appreciation it received in the House, merely show that they have no true conception of the Nationalist movement.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The Budget speech admirably exposed the true relation between England and India and betrayed the hollowness of the so-called liberal professions which have so long exerted their poisonous influence on the unsophisticated Indian mind, displaced as it was from its own orbit by an unnational education.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley’s outspokenness was welcome to the House?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Well, it was tenfold more welcome to his “enemies” in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Mr. Lalmohan Ghose in one of his more recent speeches, has said: “Dazzled by the meretricious glitter of a tawdry imperialism, conspicuous members of Parliament are now trying to sponge from their slate the teachings of men </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The political instinct of a free people long accustomed to the international struggle for life, shrewd, commercial, practical, is not likely to be misled by humanitarian generalities as the politically inexperienced middle class in India have been misled; they have always felt that the man who trod down India under a mailed heel and crushed Indian manhood and aspiration was serving their own interests.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1639"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The sequel to the trial of Warren Hastings is an excellent example of this dominant instinct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Twenty-seven years after the impeachment, sixteen years after the death of Burke had left his orations as a classic to English literature,– a scene was enacted in the House of Commons similar in spirit to the unanimous acclamation of Mr. Morley’s speech.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Warren Hastings – an old man of eighty – appeared at the bar to give evidence in connection with the renewal of the East India charter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>He was received with acclamations, a chair was ordered for him, and when he retired the members rose and uncovered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The political instinct of the people perceived that this man, ruthless and monstrous tyrant though he had been, had consolidated for them a political empire and a basis<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="456" href="#">1</a> of commercial supremacy, and the means by which this great work had been accomplished, were sanctified by the result.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The scourge of India, a recital of whose misdeeds had 27 years before made some of Burke’s listeners swoon with horror, was honoured as a hero and god, and biographies and histories have been written by the score to justify his action and exalt him to the skies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>When therefore Mr. Morley declared his intention of preserving the Empire Hastings had consolidated, by any means however unjust or tyrannical, is it any wonder that an English House of Commons should recognise in him a worthy successor of Hastings and accord to him an unanimous applause?<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1643"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Some time back a retired Anglo-Indian wrote a letter on the unrest in the Punjab in the <i>Times</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>He said: “Many English officials live for weeks and months absolutely alone among Indians, far from others of their race, and their comfort and their safety are dependent on the prestige of the English name and on the good will of the cultivators for their English rulers.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Mr. Newman the travelling editor of the <i>Englishman</i> has taken the cue from this gentleman and improved upon him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Writing on Mr. Crabbe’s murder he comments: “It may be said that the solitary murder of a European committed evidently by a desperate man who would have killed anybody who interfered with him, has no bearing at all on the general political situation in this province.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>In one way of course it has not, but the non-official view is that the crime would not have occurred but for the fact that the European has entirely lost his prestige here.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is to maintain this lost prestige that Regulation lathis and bayonets have been sent to Eastern Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But this prestige must be weak indeed to require more support.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Threats cannot keep prestige intact when it has not the power to maintain itself nor can oppression ensure its safety.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">A Congress Committee Mystery</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1647"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>When the All-India Congress Committee was appointed last December, we had no great hopes of its being of much utility either as a political instrument or an ornament, and when names were being juggled within the Pandal, we did not consider the matter of supreme interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, the names of a few men of advanced opinions did find their way into the Bengal list.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Men like Srijuts Motilal Ghose, Bipin Chandra Pal, Aswini Kumar Dutta and A. Rasul sitting side by side with Messrs. Tilak and Khaparde would form a leaven which, however small, might easily season the mass of the Committee and would at any rate prevent it from being a mere phonograph to repeat the decisions of the Dictator of Bombay.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Recently there has been much talk of a meeting of the All India Committee.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Mr. Gokhale took an active interest in the idea and a sitting was actually arranged for June 30 to consider the crisis in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>There was nothing to object to in that; it seemed right and reasonable that the Committee should at least appear to justify its existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But then comes in the peculiar feature of this Committee which turns it from a straightforward body, of politicians elected by the people and observing the ordinary rules of business, into a Tibetan mystery.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Certain gentlemen in Calcutta of more or less moderate views and irreproachable political respectability received notice of the meeting but other less favoured members of the Committee <i>were utterly unaware that the meeting was to be held at all</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>A few days before the date fixed they were astonished to receive private letters from Bombay side assuming that they knew of it and would not fail to be present on the occasion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Neither Mr. Rasul nor Moti Babu nor Bipin Babu had received any notice from the proper quarters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Since then the meeting has been postponed and for the present all’s well that ends well.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But we should like to ask one or two questions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Is it possible that the conveners in Bombay did not know the addresses of the Nationalist members? – did not know for instance, that Mr. Rasul was a Barrister-at-law, or Sj. Motilal Ghose edited a not altogether unknown journal called the <i>Amrita Bazar Patrika</i> or Srijut Bipin Chandra was </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 571</p>
<p class="PE"> connected with a weekly called <i>New India</i> of which also even Bombay worthies must at least have heard.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Or was it merely an amiable bit of “diplomatic tactics” such as it has been our privilege to witness on occasions?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We heard that Mr. Gokhale had given up the idea because he could not get the Bengal leaders to agree – though we are not aware that he made any very strenuous efforts to bring about an agreement.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Is it possible that it was only intended to call those of them this time who <i>could</i> agree?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>On the whole we are inclined to be charitable; no doubt the conveners thought that the Nationalist members would be likely to acquaint each other and the Committee might economise the public money in stamps; or else they may have published the date of meeting in some Bombay paper and left it to these gentlemen to take note – if they had the good luck to read it; or perhaps they knew all along that the sitting would not come off and did not like to trouble them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>In any case we hope that this time they will be more formal and less kind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The members in question are none of them millionaires and cannot afford, on the strength of a newspaper notice, to take a trip to Bombay – and find the meeting postponed.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Intolerance of free speech and writings is the sure index not only of unenlightened mediaevalism in the existing Government, but of its rottenness and instability.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Our old Hindu regime allowed the utmost freedom of speech and Manu lays it down that when in a time of stress and trouble people take to speaking unpleasant things about the sovereign, it is the height of folly on his part to stop their mouths by punishing the free expression of their feelings.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Our ancient law-giver has not thought it necessary to support his dictum by reasons because its wisdom is obvious to the most ordinary common sense.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1770"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>At the meeting held day before yesterday in the College Square to express sympathy with the editor of the <i>Yugantar</i> and congratulate him on his good fortune in being so signally chosen out to suffer for the Motherland, it was pointed out that Srijut Bhupendranath had initiated a new departure in the struggle with the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>He is the first who standing in the dock, called to account by the alien under alien-made law for preaching the gospel of Indian freedom to his countrymen, has refused to acknowledge any responsibility to the alien bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is extremely important that the real meaning of the attitude of the accused should not be mistaken, for it has undoubtedly been obscured by the shape into which it was put under the influence of others more accustomed to legal notions and legal phraseology than to the plain utterance of the heart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The accused was strongly represented, Srijuts Ashutosh Chaudhuri, Aswini Banerji, Chittaranjan Das and A. K. Ghose appearing for him in the case, and had he chosen, as he did not choose, to make a sensational trial of the <i>Yugantar</i> case and win for himself popular notoriety, he could easily have done so.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We think, however, it might have been better if Srijut Bhupendranath had rejected even this brilliant legal assistance and relied on the frank and straightforward utterance which wells up from the depths of a strong and abiding feeling and profound intellectual conviction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The over-careful language of legality, guiding its feet with delicate scrupulousness among a million traps and pitfalls and intent only upon avoiding a stumble, that is one thing; the clear bold speech of the patriot speaking straight to his countrymen’s hearts, enamoured of martyrdom, exalted with </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 613</p>
<p class="PE"> the passionate realisation of sacred liberty, that is quite another.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Bhupendranath’s statement was a political declaration, not a legal formula, and it should so have been expressed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately it was toned down into legal form and lost half its force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In the original statement drawn up under the instructions of the accused he had declared sans phrase, “I have done what I considered my duty to my country” and ended by saying, “I do not wish to make any farther statement or <i>to take any part in the case</i>.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>This was clear enough; the editor of <i>Yugantar</i>, consistent with the views he had publicly professed, refused to do anything which would seem to be an acknowledgement of responsibility to the codified caprice or selfishness of the small handful of alien officials who call themselves the Government established by law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>He had written with his eye not on the limitations imposed by the Penal Code, but on the needs of his country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>This responsibility was to his countrymen, not to a group of English officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>To plead before a Court constituted by the bureaucracy, was to admit his responsibility to aliens and deny his responsibility to his countrymen.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1771"><!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Unfortunately the edge of the utterance was blunted by the verbal alterations made by the pleader, who looked on the statement with the eyes of the lawyer, not of the politician.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The calm and dignified appeal to the duty his country demanded of him was marred by the legal plea of good faith; the patriot’s refusal to take part in a trial before the very authority it was his whole mission to displace, was modified into a legal abstention from any further “action” in an ordinary undefended trial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Later in the day a worse thing happened.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Srijut Ashutosh Chaudhuri has been severely criticised for the remarks with which he accompanied his refusal to give any address.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It is fair to state that he does not seem to have been accurately reported.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>We are informed that he prefaced his remarks by saying that as his client had refused to plead, he had no <i>locus standi</i> in the case; whatever he said, was therefore not spoken in the name of Srijut Bhupendranath, but merely expressed his own opinion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>We are also informed that he did not say that the accused had placed himself in the Magistrate’s hands, but simply that the case was now in the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 614</p>
<p class="PE"> Magistrate’s hands and Counsel had no farther concern in the matter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless, Mr. Chaudhuri’s intervention was unfortunate, as it has led to the obscuring of the true spirit of the statement, so much so that Srijut Bhupendranath was considering whether he should not make an additional statement in order to make clear his position but was advised that the opportunity had passed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The proposed statement was to the following effect, “I do not wish any address to be delivered by Counsel on my behalf.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>I have refused to plead not because I wish to withdraw a single word of what I have written or acknowledge the justice of any sentence that may be passed on me, but for an opposite reason.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>I have written what everyone knows to be true and what is in the minds of all my countrymen, but I was aware that in doing so I would have no chance of justice in the British Courts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>I do not think it consistent with the views I have always preached to plead before them.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1772"><!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The justice of which there was no chance, was of course, not justice according to the letter of the alien law, but moral justice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>When Mr. Aswini Banerji declared that the accused neither pleaded guilty nor not guilty, but simply declared that he had done no wrong, the Magistrate asked whether he meant legal wrong or moral wrong and certain empty-headed people in the audience laughed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But it is no laughing matter to a rule which has no roots in the soil, when there comes to be a recognized opposition, recognized equally by rulers and ruled, between the laws it enforces and the obligations of morality, when an action savagely punished by authority is recognized as morally inoffensive or praiseworthy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It means that the whole basis of the rule has become rotten, that it has neither a material nor a moral foundation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1773"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Srijut Bhupendranath’s attitude was dignified and consistent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>His duty to his country, the interests of her future, of her very life, demanded that he should preach the gospel of independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But the duty to our country, the interests of our country can be no justification before the law of the alien.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>To hope for justice therefore in political cases where one of the parties is the judge, is irrational and to plead justification to those against whom one’s action was directed, an inconsistency and a degradation.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But the most significant part of the communication is the remarkable statement about the alarm of the police at the work of the Mission.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>That alarm is a pregnant comment on the nature of the bureaucratic domination in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We have more than once pointed out that an alien rule without roots in the soil cannot possibly tolerate the growth of any strength or manliness or nobility in the subject people, and must inevitably try to crush, curb or render ineffective any actual or possible centre of strength around which it is remotely possible for the national self-consciousness to crystallize.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Hence the alarm and suspicion which a movement like the Ramakrishna Mission, utterly divorced from politics as it is, awakes in the rulers.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1791"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The approaching celebration of the 7th of August has a double importance this year, for it has not only its general and permanent importance as the commemoration of our declaration of independence, but an occasional though none the less urgent importance as an opportunity of reaffirming our separate national existence against the arbitrary and futile attempt of the bureaucracy to reaffirm and perpetuate a vanishing despotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The 7th of August will be recognised in the future as a far more important date to the building up of the nation than the 16th October.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>On the 16th October the threatened unity of Bengal was asserted against the disingenuous and dangerous attack engineered by Lord Curzon; and since it is on the solidarity of its regional and race units that the greater Pan-Indian unity can alone be firmly founded, the 16th October must always be a holy day in the Indian calendar.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But on the 7th of August Bengal discovered for India the idea of Indian independence as a living reality and not a distant Utopia, on the 7th of August she consecrated herself to the realisation of that supreme ideal by the declaration of the Boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The time has not come yet when the full meaning of that declaration can be understood; even the whole of Bengal has not yet understood, much less the whole of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>But the light is coming; partly by the efforts of the preachers of the light, still more by the efforts of the enemies of the light, it is coming: and in the dim wide glimmer of the mighty dawn we can see the vast slow surge of Indian life quickening under the breath of a stupendous wind, we can discern the angry fringes of the tide casting themselves far beyond the old low level, we can almost hear the roar of the surf </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>To those who judge only by the gross material event it may seem so, but to those who look beneath and watch the course of events as they shape themselves in the soul of a nation, the phrase will not seem one whit too excessive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It is the soul within us that decides, that makes our history, that determines Fate, and the material nature, material events only shape themselves under the limitations of Space and Time to give an outward body and realisation to the decisions of the soul.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The day of a nation’s independence is not the day when the administrative changes are made which complete the outward realisation of its independence but the day when it realises in its soul that it is free and must be free.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>For it is the self-sufficing separateness of a nation that is its independence, and when that separateness is realised and recorded as a determined thing in ourselves, the outward realisation is only a question of time.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The seventh of August was the birthday of Indian Nationalism, and Indian Nationalism, as we pointed out the other day, means two things, the self-consecration to the gospel of national freedom and the practice of independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Boycott is the practice of independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>When therefore we declared the Boycott on the seventh of August, it was no mere economical revolt we were instituting, but the practice of national independence; for the attempt to be separate and self-sufficient economically must bring with it the attempt to be free in every other function of a nation’s life; for these functions are all mutually interdependent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>August 7th is therefore the day when Indian Nationalism was born, when India discovered to her soul her own freedom, when we set our feet irrevocably on the only path to unity, the only path to self-realisation.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Let it be a reconsecration of the whole of Bengal to the new spirit and the new life, a purification of heart and mind to make it the undivided possession and the consecrated temple and habitation of the Mother.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>And secondly let it be a calm, brave and masculine reaffirmation of our independent existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy has flung itself with savage fury on the new activities of our national life; it has attempted to trample on and break to pieces under its armed heel our economical boycott; it has made the service of the motherland penal in her young men; it has visited with the prison and deportation the preaching of Nationalism by the elder men.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The 7th of August must be an emphatic answer to these persecutions and prohibitions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The Boycott must be reaffirmed and this time in its purity and simplicity as the national policy to which all are committed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The Risley Circular must be definitely and unmistakably challenged and negatived in action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Let there be a procession of students led by those venerable leaders of Bengal who are also professors of the Government University.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1802"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>It is often paradoxically urged that every step or policy which does not conduce to good feeling between the rulers and the ruled, the exploiters and the exploited, should be eschewed as both immoral and impolitical.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>And because Boycott certainly is not intended as a soothing potion for the rulers, there are some men of an unctuous humanity who look on it with alarm and distrust.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We should love our country, they say, but should not allow that love to generate hatred against other nationalities; we should prefer our own manufactures and try to improve and extend them, but to eschew foreign goods is damnable.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Nobody seriously expects the English in India to forego any of the manifold and material advantages that are bound up with their despotic possession of the country, merely out of a philanthropic tenderness for the feelings, affections or interests of the ruled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Nobody really expects them to help the development of indigenous industry at the expense of British commerce merely because the millions of India are starving and ground down with poverty and miserable and discontented.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It was started on the 6th of August last year and its anniversary falls strictly on that date.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>But it is only in the fitness of things that the organ of Indian Nationalism should choose the birthday of Nationalism in the country for the purpose of observing its anniversary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The 7th of August, therefore, has another importance to the Nationalists of Bengal who brought into existence their accredited journal just in time to hail that historic date.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It came into being in answer to an imperative public need and not to satisfy any private ambition or personal whim; it was born in a great and critical hour for the whole nation and has a message to deliver which nothing on earth can prevent it from delivering.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1816"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Srijut Surendranath Banerji in his remarkable speech in College Square, the other day, observed that what the country now needed was not oratory but statesmanship, for the only effective answer to bureaucratic repression is the organisation of the whole strength of the country to carry out its national<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="482" href="#">1</a> ideal in spite of all repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We think the veteran leader has gauged the situation very accurately, but we confess we do not see at present where the statesmanship is to come from which is to carry out the difficult, arduous and delicate task before us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>What we have done hitherto we have done without leadership, almost without clear purpose, under an inspiring and impelling force which we must necessarily think divine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Where that force has visibly guided us, we have done astonishing things: but at the same time there has been much confusion, one-sidedness and incoherence in our work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>And now that a powerful and organised Government has set itself in grim earnest to destroy our movement, it is imperative that we too should organise and make our whole potential strength effective for self-defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The divine guidance will only be continued to us if we show ourselves in our strength and wisdom worthy of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>But it cannot be denied that the first effect of the repression has been to disorganise our work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Since it began, there has been no concerted and coherent action, every man has done what seemed good in his own eyes or else remained inactive.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The result has been much weakness, supineness and ineffectiveness.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>All Bengal is heartily agreed in Swadeshi and professedly all are agreed on the necessity of industrial boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>But a majority of the older leaders, trained in another school of politics, cannot adapt themselves to the new state of things, they cannot even throw themselves heartily into the only measures which can make the industrial<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="483" href="#">2</a> boycott crushingly effective, and they are out of sympathy with the wider developments of boycott which are becoming indispensable if we are to meet the bureaucratic attack with full success.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>They object personally to the new men and decline to work in co-operation with them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The new men, on the other hand, who have immensely increased their following and influence in the country, are not in possession of the machinery of Congress and Conference, are in fact zealously excluded from it by the present possessors and have but small following among the richer men who might provide the sinews of war.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>They are moreover prevented, by a natural unwillingness to hopelessly divide the nation, from organising a machinery of their own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Yet to talk of organising the nation while excluding the new men is absurd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If the older party have the greater solidity and resources, the younger men have the lion’s share of the energy and driving force, they divide the great middle class and are no longer there in a hopeless minority, but are gathering adherents all over the country (even in Madras they commanded one third of the votes at the last Conference) and they exercise an overwhelming empire over the minds of the rising generation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>To organise the nation means to make all its elements of strength efficient for a single clear and well-understood work under the leadership of a recognised central force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>To exclude such important forces as these we have described, means simply<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="484" href="#">3</a> to leave the nation unorganised.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1818"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The country is in need of a statesman, yes: but what kind of statesman?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>He must be a man thoroughly steeped in the gospel of Nationalism, with a clear and fearless recognition of the goal to which we are moving, with a dauntless courage to aim consciously, steadily, indomitably towards it, with a consummate </p>

<p class="PE"> skill to mask his movements and aims when necessary and to move boldly and openly when necessary, and, last but not least, with an overmastering magnetic power and tact to lead and use and combine men of all kinds and opinions.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It is an encouraging sign of the times that Surendranath is coming more and more into sympathy with thorough-going Nationalism, but will he have the courage and magnanimity to hold out his hand to the new men, and if he does will he be able to retain the loyalty of his principal followers?<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The object of giving this uncalled-for prominence to the old and natural relations between the two communities is of course to convey the idea that they are anomalous, surprising and quite different from the normal relations in the rest of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1842"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>That boycott is the central question of Indian politics is now a generally recognised fact, recognised openly or tacitly by its supporters and its opponents alike.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Anglo-Indian papers are busy trying to make out that it is a chimera and a failure: the executive are straining every nerve to crush it by magisterial interference, by police <i>zulum</i>, by prosecution of newspapers and all the familiar machinery of repressive despotism: the friends of the alien among ourselves are reiterating that the movement is a foolish affair and that no nation ever was made by boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>If boycott had really been an impossibility or a failure, it is obvious that all this elaborate machinery would not have been brought into play to crush it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>On the contrary it has become a very substantial reality, a very palpable success, and now stands out, as we have said, as the<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="495" href="#">2</a> central and all-important question of Indian politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Those who say that no nation was ever made by boycott, do not know what they are talking about, do not understand what boycott is, do not know the teachings of history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Boycott is much more than a mere economical device, it is a rediscovery of national self-respect, a declaration of national separateness: it is the first practical assertion of independence and has therefore in most of the national uprisings of modern times been the forerunner of the struggle for independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The American struggle with England began in an enthusiastic and determined boycott of British goods enforced by much the same methods as the Indian boycott but with a much more stringent </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 639</p>
<p class="PE"> and effective organisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The Italian uprising of 1848 was heralded by the boycott of Austrian cigarettes and the tobacco riots in<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="496" href="#">3</a> Milan.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The boycott was the indispensable weapon of the Parnell movement in Ireland, and boycott and Swadeshi are the leading cries of Sinn Fein.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The first practical effect of the resurgence of China was the boycott of American goods as an assertion of China’s long down-trodden self-respect against the brutal and insolent dealings of the Americans towards Chinese immigrants.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>In India also boycott began as an assertion of national self-respect, and continued as a declared and practical enforcement of national separateness, liberty, independence and self-dependence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>“We will no longer tamely bear injury and insult, we will no longer traffic and huckster with others for broken fragments of rights and privileges; we are free, we are separate, we are sufficient to ourselves for our own salvation,” that was what boycott meant and what its enemies have understood it to mean: its economical aspect is only an aspect.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1843"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The economical boycott has been on the whole an immense success,– not indeed in every respect, for the crusade against foreign sugar has not diminished the import, though it may have checked to some extent the natural increase of the import, and the Tarpur sugar factory is, we understand, in danger of failing because people will not buy the dearer Swadeshi sugar,– an example of the futility of “honest” Swadeshi unsupported by a self-sacrificing boycott: but enormous reductions have been made in the import not only of cotton goods but of all kinds of wearing apparel, and salt has been appreciably affected.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But now the whole weight of bureaucratic power is being brought to bear in order to shatter the boycott, and if we intend to save it we must oppose the organised force of the bureaucracy by the organised will of the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>What the unorganised will of the people could do, it has done: it has indeed effected miracles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But no statesman will rely on the perpetual continuation of a miracle, he will seek to counteract weaknesses, to take full advantage of every element of strength and to bring into action new elements of strength: he will in short utilize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="497" href="#">4</a> every available means towards the one great national end.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>And the readiest way to organise the country is to organise boycott.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1844"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The chief weakness of the movement has been the want of co-ordinated action.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>We have left everything to personal and local enthusiasm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The consequence is that while in East Bengal the boycott is a fact, in West Bengal it is an idea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>There is some Swadeshi in West Bengal, there is no boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Moreover Bengal has not brought its united influence to bear upon the other provinces in order to make the boycott universal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The whole force of this vast country is a force which no government could permanently resist.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But this force has not been brought to bear on the struggle, Bengal and Punjab have been left to fight out their battles unaided, without the active sympathy of the rest of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>This must be altered, the rest of India must be converted and we must not rest till we have secured a mandate from the Congress for an universal boycott of British goods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile we must bring West Bengal into a line with East Bengal, and for that purpose we must have a stringent and effective organisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>We need not go far for the system which will be most effective.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We have only to apply or adapt to the circumstances of the country the methods used by the American boycotters against England.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1848"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Mr. N. N. Ghose of the <i>Indian Nation</i> has some name in this country as an educated and even a learned man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>He himself does not conceal his opinion that he is almost if not quite the only well-educated man in India and is perpetually asking the acknowledged exponents of public opinion on the Nationalist side what educational qualifications they possess which would justify them in advising or instructing their countrymen in politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>At one time it is the conductors of <i>Bande Mataram</i> who are put to the question; at another it is so able a political thinker </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 641</p>
<p class="PE"> and orator as Srijut Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="498" href="#">2</a> Chandra Pal whose speeches and writings have extorted the reluctant admiration of our bitterest opponents in England; at another it is the editor of <i>Yugantar</i> who is apostrophied as an ill-educated adolescent – a paper every single issue of which evidences more knowledge, reading and power of thought and expression than the whole year’s output of the <i>Indian Nation</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In the latest issue of his weekly Mr. Ghose has penned an article on the prospects of Nationality in India – which he thinks to be very bad indeed – and in trying to support his thesis by examples from history he has perpetrated such astonishing blunders, of so gross and elementary a character, that one wonders what ill-educated adolescent usurped the editorial chair usually occupied by the Principal of the Metropolitan College.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We will give only a few samples of Mr. Ghose’s historical knowledge.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The unification of the Italian republics into a nation, he says, was not so much the effect as the cause of Italian independence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>We leave for the moment the truth of the statement which is contrary to the facts of history; but we should like to know what on earth our universal critic means by his Italian republics?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>There were republics in mediaeval Italy, but we did not know that Naples and Sicily were republics under King Bomba, or Rome under the Popes, or Tuscany under the Grand Duke, or Lombardy under the Austrians, or Sardinia and Piedmont under the descendants of Victor Amadeus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Then again Mr. Ghose has “observed” that the different States of Greece developed a national unity as soon as they had a common enemy in the Persian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Really?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>We had always thought that the one outstanding fact of Greek history was the utter inability of these states to develop national unity at all, the sentiment of Panhellenism never having a look-in against the separatist spirit of the city-states.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>And then he tells us that the provinces and states of ancient Italy (whatever that may mean) also readily united into a great national state in the presence of a foreign enemy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Yet those foolish historians tell us that Italy was united not at all willingly by the Roman sword and the Carthaginian invasion simply tested the solidity of the Roman structure; it certainly did not create it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But it would be a wearisome task to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> hunt down all the errors with which the article is packed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We think that after this Mr. N. N. Ghose had better stop questioning other people about their qualifications for instructing the people and examine his own.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1849"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>But in spite of his historical blunders he has succeeded in giving expression to a very common error which troubles many patriotic people and unnerves their faith and weakens the quality of their patriotism: “Let it be distinctly remembered and never forgotten that the essential conditions of a nationality are unity of language, unity of religion and life, unity of race.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>And because there is diversity of race, religion and language in India he thinks that there is no possibility of creating a nationality in this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>This is a very common stumbling-block, but is there any reality in it?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Rather we find that every nationality has been formed not because of, but in spite of, diversity of race or religion or language, and not unoften in spite of the co-existence of all these diversities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The <i>Indian Nation</i> has itself admitted that the English nation has been built out of various races, but he has not stated the full complexity of the British nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>He has not observed that to this day the races which came later into the British nationality keep their distinct individuality even now and that one of them clings to its language tenaciously.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>He has carefully omitted the striking example of Switzerland where distinct racial strains speaking three different languages and, later, professing different religions coalesced into and persisted as one nation without sacrificing a single one of these diversities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>In France three different languages are spoken, in America the candidates for the White<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="499" href="#">3</a> House address the nation in fourteen languages, Austria is a congeries of races and languages, the divisions in Russia are hardly less acute.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>That unity in race, religion or language is essential to nationality is an idea which will not bear examination.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Such elements of unity are very helpful to the growth of a nationality, but they are not essential and will not even of themselves assure its growth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The Roman Empire though it created a common language, a common religion and life, and did its best to crush out racial diversities under the heavy weight of its uniform system failed to make one great nation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="PE">If these are not essential elements of nationality, what, it may be asked, are the essential elements?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>We answer that there are certain essential conditions, geographical unity, a common past, a powerful common interest impelling towards unity and certain favourable political conditions which enable the impulse to realise itself in an organised government expressing the nationality and perpetuating its single and united existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>This may be provided by a part of the nation, a race or community, uniting the others under its leadership or domination, or by an united resistance to a common pressure from outside or within.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>A common enthusiasm coalescing with a common interest is the most powerful fosterer of nationality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We believe that the necessary elements are present in India, we believe that the time has come and that by a common resistance to a common pressure in the shape of the boycott, inspired by a common enthusiasm and ideal, that united nationality for which the whole history of India has been a preparation, will be speedily and mightily accomplished.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1861"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The situation in Bengal is one of a very peculiar kind and of extraordinary interest.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>There is a deep and widespread unrest in the country; a movement has commenced which the bureaucracy holds to be fraught with serious danger certainly to the British monopoly of commercial exploitation, possibly to the supremacy of British officialdom.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>In order to save these threatened citadels the bureaucrats in the Punjab and Eastern Bengal have embarked on a policy of thorough-going repression in which the practically unlimited and arbitrary power of an autocratic executive is backed up and confirmed by a zealous judiciary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The union of these two forces is essential to the success of the bureaucratic plan of campaign: for the strength of the bureaucratic position lies in the fact that all the powers of legislation and administration are centred unreservedly and without limitation in its hands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It controls the men by whom the law and the executive administration are carried out, for it not only exercises all the patronage of both services, but wields immense disciplinary powers.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> not act according to its expectations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>In an hour of crisis like the present when there is a powerful movement undisguisedly directed against the continued supremacy of the present ruling community in all its aspects, this concentration of all powers against the insurgence of the subject people<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="503" href="#">2</a> is of the most vital importance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The executive must have a free hand to deal with the opposition of the demos without being hampered by inconvenient and trammelling considerations of legal procedure and the narrow limits of legality.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>But in a fight with an acute and intelligent people, a nation of born lawyers, this is only possible on condition that the judiciary are willing to support and confirm the actions of the executive unhesitatingly and without a qualm.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>These conditions have been secured in East Bengal and still more completely in the Punjab.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But there is one weak point, the Achilles’ heel in the otherwise invulnerable constitution of the bureaucracy, and that is the High Court of Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The oldest and most venerable institution of British rule, with the most honourable traditions of integrity and independence maintained by a series of judges learned in the law, trained to the love of justice and equity and a calm judicial habit of mind, the High Court had become a thing cherished and valued, a refuge to the oppressed, a guarantee of eventual relief against executive vagaries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It had therefore attracted an almost superstitious reverence<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="504" href="#">3</a> and was the chief moral asset of British rule.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is true that the High Court is independent of the executive authorities, but it is under the control of the Chief Justice, and by the simple device of securing a Chief Justice of weak personality and multiplying civilian judges of the right kind the institution can easily be converted into a source of strength to the bureaucracy instead of a source of weakness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Since the beginning of the reactionary policy which followed the Viceroyalty of Lord Ripon, this has been the increasing tendency of the High Court and the trust and reverence of the people has decreased proportionately, and the hold of British rule on their imaginations has decreased with it.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1866"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The London <i>Times</i> has developed a new Newmaniac all to itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The original Newmaniac of Calcutta had the National Volunteers for his special monomania: the <i>Times</i> specimen seems to have got the Arya Samaj on his brain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>In a long and elaborate article he has traced the genesis of this dangerous group, its control over the bourgeoisie, its deadly seditious attempts to make use of the masses, and the final extinction of the rebellious movement by the strong and masterly policy of Sir Denzil Ibbetson.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>All this reads well as the romance of history, but when it is given us as a serious attempt to account for the situation in the Punjab, we begin to see what a plentiful lack of wisdom and knowledge governs us in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>For we may be sure that the diet of lies which the <i>Times</i> correspondent serves up as a dainty dish for the British public, is merely a daintily-seasoned version of the official view in the Punjab.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It is not to be questioned that the present struggle is a contest between the intellectuals of India who are recruited mainly from the middle class, and the alien officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>In the struggle the former are attempting to range all classes under the common banner of liberty and Indian resurgence, just as the same class has done in Russia, and there is nothing in the aim or the movement which is illegitimate or immoral.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>If there is any immorality, it is surely on the side of the ruling class which is fighting for monopoly and privilege while the bourgeoisie are fighting for their own self-preservation and the life and expansion of their race and nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The <i> Times</i> correspondent speaks acutely enough when he says that the middle class are trying to make their will the will of the nation and the object of the bureaucracy must be to prevent that consummation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But when the writer begins to trace all evil to the Arya Samaj, he at once passes into the regions of romance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>No doubt the lion’s share of the political spirit and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 650</p>
<p class="PE"> genius in the Punjab belongs to the Aryas, but that is the result of the manliness of the creed preached by Dayananda and the admirable working power, self-sacrifice and gift of organisation which the Samaj has fostered among its members.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>But self-sacrifice, energy, organisation are precisely what most terrify the panic-stricken Anglo-Indian, and nothing will convince him that where these are, there is not a dangerous conspiracy against the British Raj.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We may tell this new Newmaniac that if there were such a serious and skilfully engineered movement as the one he affects to describe,– well, the special correspondent of the <i>Times</i> would not be touring at his ease and writing nonsense at the present moment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Whatever has happened in India has been the result of great spontaneous forces without organisation or even conscious purpose: those who have seen where they were going, have been a small minority.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1870"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The persistence of the <i>Englishman</i>’s attack on Justice Mitter in connection with the Bloomfield Murder Case is worthy of the traditions of Hare Street.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The <i>Englishman</i> is perhaps the only Anglo-Indian paper in Calcutta which has a rigidly settled and consistent policy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Others allow themselves to be swayed sometimes by feeling and by calm dispassionate reason, and yield perhaps to some gust of generous feeling or suffer the sense of justice or fair play to overcome the dictates of class interest or policy, but Hare Street is above such weaknesses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Not much brains or political knowledge or discernment is needed to guide its policy, for it is simple and elementary in the extreme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>A violent and venomous opposition to every Indian aspiration, to every claim to equality or even to ordinary justice, is the sole, simple and sufficient principle which guides it unerringly through the maze of politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Legally the excited correspondents who pour out their fury and panic in its sympathetic pages, have not a leg to stand on.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Some of them have made clumsy attempts to argue the point of agitation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The attempt is absurd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The position taken by the Judges is unassailable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Intention cannot be argued from the results of an action, but from the nature of the actions and utterances of the doer and from the probable consequences of his act as they may be reasonably supposed to have presented themselves to his mind.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Now the actions of the assailants in this case were not such as to raise any certainty of their intention to kill.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Men have been beaten by numbers and savagely beaten without being left dead, but have at most had to spend more or less time in hospital recovering from their injuries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The cessation of the beating as soon as the victim fell down, the words of the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 652</p>
<p class="PE"> assailants as they ran away and several other circumstances seem to show that this was the result they aimed at, and the cumulative effect of these indications is very great.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>At any rate, in the face of such strong considerations in favour of the more lenient view, and in the absence of any positive evidence that the accused premeditated the assault, much less the manslaughter, any Judge knowing his business would feel himself bound to give them the benefit of the doubt so long as the principle of refusing to convict on a mere probability of guilt remains a fundamental principle of law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We can say without any fear of contradiction that the <i>Englishman</i> would not have a word to say against the Judgment if it had been any other than an European who had died: and if it had been an Indian done to death by an Englishman, Hare Street would have yelled itself hoarse over the brutal severity of the sentences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The position taken up is that because an Englishman was killed, somebody ought to have been hanged and all who were not hanged transported for life: otherwise the life of planters in the mofussil cannot be safe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Possibly, but the safety of European life in the mofussil is an extrajudicial consideration with which the Judges of the High Court, or any judges for the matter of that, are not concerned.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Their sole business is to do justice, without any regard to the political consequences.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The safety of European life is a question for the executive or for the political authorities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If the planters have made themselves so fiercely hated or the bureaucrats have by their policy rendered Europeans such an eyesore to the Indian masses that the latter are ready to murder them without serious provocation and can only be restrained by savage and iniquitous sentences in the law courts, it is for the planters and the bureaucrats to mend their ways and ease the tension: they cannot expect just and upright men to stain their consciences for their sake.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Our contemporary anticipates all sorts of curious and pleasing results from his new departure, and even breaks out into irregular blank verse in his ecstasy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>“Then comes again the care-free heart of youth, the lines of trouble fade from the face, the empty pocket, like that of Virgil’s traveller, becomes a cause for song, or like that of the schoolboy, a hoarding place for curious and assorted treasure.”<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>As usual the bulk of his answer is composed of irrelevant abuse, but we are glad to note that except towards the end where his passion of spite and wounded vanity has broken out in a furious yell of hatred, he has tried to curb his natural inclination to couch the logic of Billingsgate in the language of the gutter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We pointed out that Mr. N. N. Ghose’s “historical facts” – which he had brought forward to prove his theory that Nationality was possible everywhere except in India,– were all blunders of which a schoolboy would have been ashamed, and we drew the inevitable conclusion that the sage of Sankaritola<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="512" href="#">1</a> was an ignoramus in history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>That was exceedingly plain language, no doubt, but it was relevant to the issue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>A man who knows nothing about history, has no business to argue from history and foist on the public conclusions drawn from his own imagination or from others and distorted in the borrowing under the disingenuous pretence that they are the “laws of national growth” as ascertained from an accurate study of the world’s past experience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>And what is Mr. N. N. Ghose’s answer?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>His answer is that Srijut Aurobindo Ghose is a coward and had not courage to ride a horse and that he would never have been a patriot if he had not failed in the Indian Civil Service.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The question is not whether Srijut Aurobindo Ghose </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>With regard to the facts he has practically admitted defeat.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>An ignoramus who pretends to a monopoly of knowledge and wisdom, and is always questioning other people about their educational qualifications, makes himself offensive and deserves to be exposed but an ignoramus who confesses that he is an ignoramus is harmless and even an object of kindly pity.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>We shall however leave his self-justification on this point for future treatment and deal with the more substantial issues he has raised in his defence.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1900"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Mr. N. N. Ghose’s position – and we notice it only because it is the position of better men than he – is contained in the following luminous sentence: “The bookish politician is not able to cite a single instance where a nation was made by boycott or under any conditions other than the unities we have more than once referred to.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Here there are two propositions, one, that boycott never made a nation, the other that in every case of the building up of a nationality there have been present as indispensable conditions and the only causes of the growth of nationality Mr. Ghose’s three precious unities,– viz., a single language, a single race, a single religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>A more shallow, ignorant and unfounded brace of assertions it would be difficult to imagine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We pointed out in the first article in which we condescended to notice Mr. Ghose’s flounderings, several instances of nations which have been welded into unity and maintained their unity without possessing a single one of these indispensable “unities”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>As for unity of race there is not a single one of the European nations which is not a compound of several races except, possibly, the Scandinavian peoples.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Everyone knows, except the Sankaritola<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="513" href="#">2</a> sage, that race and nationality are two totally different things which have no necessary relation to each other, since one depends upon common descent while the other is a geographical and political unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>One might just as well say that different chemical elements cannot combine into a single substance as that different races cannot combine into a single nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>There is no such irreconcilable divergence between the races in India as to make their union an impossibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>If we turn to unity of language we find a respectable number of nations which do not speak a single language.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Three languages are spoken in Switzerland, the same number in France, while Welsh holds its own in Great Britain.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Unity of language, therefore, is not necessary to nationality, only the recognition of one prevalent language as the State language is required.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>If America, needing to be addressed in fourteen languages by her would-be Presidents is a nation, if the Swiss speaking three different languages on equal terms are a nation, what reason is there that the people of India should not federate into a single political unity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>As for the religious difficulty, it is an old bogey.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We do not deny the difficulty created by the divisions between the Mahomedans and Hindus, but it is idle to <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> say that the difficulty is insuperable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>If the spirit of nationalism conquered the much fiercer intolerance of the religious struggles in Europe after the reformation, it is not irrational to hope as much for India in the twentieth century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>We have not seen in Mr. N. N. Ghose’s polemics a single argument or favourable instance for his pretentious theory of the three unities of nationalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>We do not deny that it would be a great help to us if we had a single language or professed a single religion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But we do deny that these “unities”, still less the unity of race, are indispensable.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1911"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We have felt considerable delicacy hitherto in writing on the prosecution of Srijut Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="519" href="#">1</a> Chandra Pal for refusing to take the oath in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case, as that prosecution has arisen directly out of our own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>In fact all the more important events of recent occurrence in Calcutta have been so closely connected, directly or indirectly, with this case that we have been practically compelled to keep our lips closed on current public affairs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The imprisonment of the Nationalist orator and propagandist, the most prominent public figure of the New Party in Bengal, is nevertheless a matter of capital importance on which we cannot remain silent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Without touching on the relations of this affair with the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case we shall say what we have to say on the political aspect of the vindictive sentence passed by the third Presidency Magistrate, an obscure servant of the bureaucracy, on the man with a great and historic mission whom the strange incongruous humour of Fate brought before his petty judgment-seat.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Mr. Hume asked for a conviction on the ground that Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="521" href="#">3</a> Babu had baulked the prosecution in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Apart from the large assumption involved in the assertion that his evidence would have materially assisted the prosecution this appears to us a singular plea for a lawyer to put forward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It has not yet been made a crime punishable under the Penal Code to baulk a Government prosecution and if it was the intention to draw the Magistrate’s attention to the political bearings of the case, it was at least </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 673</p>
<p class="PE"> maladroit to allow the suggestion to be palpable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We will take it, however, that the Magistrate sentenced Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="522" href="#">4</a> Babu for a breach of the law which the defendant did not deny, not for an action of which there was no evidence and which is not an offence under the law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>What then was Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="523" href="#">5</a> Babu’s offence?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Certainly it was not that he carried the policy of Boycott beyond the limits of legality and preferred adhesion to his own political programme before the dictates of the alien’s law.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>That would have been an action which, however pardonable or praiseworthy in the eyes of patriots engaged in a life and death struggle with the bureaucracy, must necessarily figure as a serious offence in the eyes of the bureaucracy itself and we could hardly quarrel with its servant for trying to serve the interests of his employers by the infliction of a severe punishment.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>But it was distinctly declared by Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="524" href="#">6</a> Babu that it was not as a boycotter, not with the political intention of making the working of the bureaucratic law-courts impossible that he declined to give evidence or take the oath.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The boycott in Bengal has not yet been extended in practice to the law courts, and even in theory it is proposed to extend it only to voluntary resort to the protection of the alien authorities and not to cases in which one is compelled to them by a warrant or a summons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>A few men like Bhupendranath Dutt who have realised freedom in their souls and refuse to be bound by any limitations of an alien making, may decline to have anything to do with the law which the nation had no hand in framing and the courts over which the nation has no control, but this has not yet become the accepted policy of the New Party and there was no moral compulsion on its leader to make any such refusal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If it had been an ordinary case of crime, he would not have refused to give evidence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>It was, in fact, as an individual case of conscience that he regarded the question.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>In his first statement Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="525" href="#">7</a> Babu declared that it was the duty of a citizen to refuse to take any part in such cases which are manifestly unjust and injurious to society and the peace of the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>In his later statement the expression about the duty of the citizen was, wisely we think, dropped: for we in India are not citizens and having no rights of citizenship cannot be saddled with any duties of citizenship.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>If therefore we recognise any obligation to respect and obey the law, it is not as citizens but as members of the social order who are interested in its maintenance and in the maintenance of peace and order so long as and no longer than that order and peace do not militate against the well-being of the society instead of promoting it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The moment obedience to the law involves a wound to society, the individual is brought face to face with a difficult case of conscience.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>He was called on to associate himself as a prosecution witness with a political policy carried on under the forms of law, a policy which he considered fatal to the well-being and peace of the nation, but which he had no means of challenging except by the passive protest of refusing to perform the function required of him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>He had to obey either the dictates of his conscience or the requirements of the law and he held the imperative command of his conscience a more sacred and binding law than the Penal Code.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The law had a right to assert itself by inflicting on him a nominal or slight penalty, it had no right to punish a man vindictively for obeying his conscience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Magistrate thought perhaps that he was serving the interests of the present system and ensuring its stability by putting Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="527" href="#">9</a> Pal in prison for six months, but what has he really done?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Merely made people believe that the bureaucracy is so savage in its repression, so enamoured of power, that for its sake it will not even allow a man to possess a conscience, that an honest and reluctant protest on the part of a distinguished and honourable man against a misuse of the law will be punished by it with eager severity if it happens to conflict with its own interests or its repressive policy.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1932"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We fear our correspondent who has criticised on another page the consistency of our views on caste, has hardly taken any trouble to understand the real drift of our articles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>His attitude seems to be that we must be either entirely for caste as it at present exists or entirely against the institution and condemn it root and branch in the style of the ordinary unthinking social reformer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Because on the one hand we protested against the ignorant abuse of the institution often indulged in simply because it is different in form and spirit from European institutions, and on the other hand emphasized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="530" href="#">1</a> the perversions of its form and spirit and the necessity of its transformation in the pure spirit of Hinduism, our correspondent imagines that we are inconsistent and guilty of adopting successively two different and incompatible attitudes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Our position is perfectly clear and straightforward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Caste was originally an arrangement for the distribution of functions in society, just as much as class in Europe, but the principle on which the distribution was based in India was peculiar to this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The civilisation of Europe has always been preponderatingly material and the division of classes was material in its principles and material in its objects, but our civilisation has always been preponderatingly spiritual and moral, and caste division in India had a spiritual object and a spiritual and moral basis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>The division of classes in Europe had its root in a distribution of powers and rights and developed and still develops through a struggle of conflicting interests; its aim was merely the organisation of society for its own sake and mainly indeed for its economic convenience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The division of castes in India was conceived as a distribution of duties.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>A man’s caste depended on his <i>dharma</i>, his </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 683</p>
<p class="PE"> spiritual, moral and practical duties, and his <i>dharma</i> depended on his <i>swabhava</i>, his temperament and inborn nature.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>A Brahmin was a Brahmin not by mere birth, but because he discharged the duty of preserving the spiritual and intellectual elevation of the race, and he had to cultivate the spiritual temperament and acquire the spiritual training which could alone qualify him for the task.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The Kshatriya was a Kshatriya not merely because he was the son of warriors and princes, but because he discharged the duty of protecting the country and preserving the high courage and manhood of the nation, and he had to cultivate the princely temperament and acquire the strong and lofty Samurai training which alone fitted him for his duties.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>So it was with the Vaishya whose function was to amass wealth for the race and the Sudra who discharged the humbler duties of service without which the other castes could not perform their share of labour for the common good.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>This was what we meant when we said that caste was a socialistic institution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>No doubt there was a gradation of social respect which placed the function of the Brahmin at the summit and the function of the Sudra at the base, but this inequality was accidental, external, <i>vyavaharika</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Essentially there was, between the devout Brahmin and the devout Sudra, no inequality in the single Virat Purusha of which each was a necessary part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Chokha Mela, the Maratha Pariah, became the guru of Brahmins proud of their caste purity; the Chandala taught Shankaracharya: for the Brahman was revealed in the body of the Pariah and in the Chandala there was the utter presence of Shiva the Almighty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Heredity entered into caste divisions, and in the light of the conclusions of modern knowledge who shall say erroneously?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But it entered into it as a subordinate element.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>For Hindu civilisation being spiritual based its institutions on spiritual and moral foundations and subordinated the material elements and material considerations.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Caste therefore was not only an institution which ought to be immune from the cheap second-hand denunciations so long in fashion, but a supreme necessity without which Hindu civilisation could not have developed its distinctive character or worked out its unique mission.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1933"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But to recognise this is not to debar ourselves from pointing </p>

<p class="PE"> out its later perversions and desiring its transformation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It is the nature of human institutions to degenerate, to lose their vitality, and decay, and the first sign of decay is the loss of flexibility and oblivion of the essential spirit in which they were conceived.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The spirit is permanent, the body changes; and a body which refuses to change must die.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The spirit expresses itself in many ways while itself remaining essentially the same, but the body must change to suit its changing environments if it wishes to live.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>There is no doubt that the institution of caste degenerated.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>It ceased to be determined by spiritual qualifications which, once essential, have now come to be subordinate and even immaterial and is determined by the purely material tests of occupation and birth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>By this change it has set itself against the fundamental tendency of Hinduism which is to insist on the spiritual and subordinate the material and thus lost most of its meaning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The spirit of caste arrogance, exclusiveness and superiority came to dominate it instead of the spirit of duty, and the change weakened the nation and helped to reduce us to our present condition.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is these perversions which we wish to see set right.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The institution must transform itself so as to fulfil its essential and permanent object under the changed conditions of modern times.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>If it refuses to change, it will become a mere social survival and crumble to pieces.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>If it transforms itself, it will yet play a great part in the fulfilment of civilisation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1934"><!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Our correspondent accuses us of attempting to corrupt society with the intrusion of the European idea of Socialism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Socialism is not an European idea, it is essentially Asiatic and especially Indian.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>What is called Socialism in Europe, is the old Asiatic attempt to effect a permanent solution of the economic problem of society which will give man leisure and peace to develop undisturbed his higher self.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Without Socialism democracy would remain a tendency that never reached its fulfilment, a rule of the masses by a small aristocratic or monied class with the consent and votes of the masses, or a tyranny of the artisan classes over the rest.<!--/SENT-->

Prosecution</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1938"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The prosecution of the <i>Bande Mataram</i>, the most important of the numerous Press prosecutions recently instituted by the bureaucracy, commenced with a flourish of trumpets, eagerly watched by a hopeful Anglo-Indian<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="531" href="#">1</a> Press, has ended in the most complete and dismal fiasco such as no Indian Government has ever had to experience before in a sedition case.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The failure has not been the result of any lukewarmness or half-heartedness in the conduct of the prosecution or any unwillingness to convict on the part of the trying Magistrate.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Police left no stone unturned to get a particular man convicted, the Standing Counsel did not hesitate to press every possible point and make the most of every stray scrap or faint shadow of evidence against the accused, the Magistrate was a Civilian Magistrate whose leanings have never been concealed, the same who gave two years to the <i>Yugantar</i> Printer, who sent Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="532" href="#">2</a> Pal before a subservient Bengali Magistrate with a plain hint to give him a heavy punishment, who sentenced Sushil Kumar to fifteen stripes, who brushed aside the evidence of barristers in favour of Police testimony, and every paragraph of whose judgment in the present case shows that he would readily have dealt out a handsome term of hard labour if the evidence had afforded him the slightest justification for a conviction.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>All the winning cards in the game are in the hands of the bureaucracy in such a trial.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>They can command the best legal knowledge in the country, they have a detective and secret service system which for political purposes is popularly supposed to be second only in its elaborateness to the Russian, they have their own servants sitting on the bench to try a case in which they are deeply interested, there is no trouble about </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 687</p>
<p class="PE"> juries who might be unwilling to convict, the Police have unlimited powers of search and can even turn the Post Office into a branch of the detective department, their methods of discovering witnesses are various and effective; yet with all this they were unable to bring forward a single scrap of convincing evidence to prove that the particular man they were bent on running down was the Editor.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The Magistrate in his judgment and the affectionate Friend of India in Chowringhee in his comments have drawn from this failure the lesson that the laws against the freedom of the Press should be made more stringent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>An ordinary unilluminated intelligence would have come rather to the conclusion that the executive authorities would do well to reform their method of instituting proceedings in a political trial.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1939"><!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The one important lesson of the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case is the light which it throws on the spirit in which the bureaucracy have been instituting the political prosecutions and persecutions which have latterly seemed to be their only reason of existence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This spirit has been exposed in a lurid and sensational manner in the Comilla case when an innocent man with difficulty escaped the gallows to which a political prosecution had condemned him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case also there has been a less sensational though sufficient exposure of the same sinister spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>What has been the whole meaning and aim of this prosecution?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Certainly not an honest impartial desire to vindicate outraged law and check without personal animus or any purely political aim a wanton tendency to disturb the public tranquillity, which would be the only excuse for a sedition prosecution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It has been an obvious attempt to crush a particular paper and a particular individual.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy has sought to cripple or silence the <i>Bande Mataram</i> because it has been preaching with extraordinary success a political creed which was dangerous to the continuance of bureaucratic absolutism and was threatening to become a centre of strength round which many Nationalistic forces might gather.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It has sought to single out and silence a particular individual because it chose to think that he was, as the Friend of India expresses it, the master mind behind the policy of the paper.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If we are challenged to justify this assertion, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 688</p>
<p class="PE"> it will be sufficient to point to the conduct of this case from its very inception.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bande Mataram</i> has been for over a year attacking without fear and without disguise the present system of government and advocating a radical and revolutionary change.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>It has advocated that change on grounds of historical experience, the first principles of politics and the necessity of national self-preservation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It has not minced matters or sought to conceal revolutionary aspirations under the veil of moderate professions or ambiguous phraseology.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It has not concealed its opinion that the bureaucracy cannot be expected to transform itself, that the people of India and not the people of England must save India, and that we cannot hope for any boons but must wrest what we desire by strong national combination from unwilling hands.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Hundreds of articles have appeared in the paper in this vein and the bureaucrats had only to pick and choose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But they have not attacked one of these articles, nor did their counsel venture to cite even a single one of them to prove seditious intention.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The fact is that, however dangerous such a propaganda may be to an absolutist handful desiring to perpetuate their irresponsible rule, no government pretending to call itself civilised can prosecute it as seditious without forfeiting all claim to the last vestige of the world’s respect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>But though the paper could not be characterised as seditious, it was highly inconvenient, and there was a growing clamour which extended even to the cloudy home of the Thunderer in London, for its prosecution and, if possible, suppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>And so watch is kept to find the paper tripping over some trifle, for which it can be hauled up and got into trouble on a side issue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>What is the matter for which the <i> Bande Mataram</i> was prosecuted?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>A reprint of the official translations of certain articles from a vernacular paper, translations issued as part of a case in the law-courts and reproduced as such,– that is one count; and an insignificant correspondence which does not even profess to give voice to the policy of the paper,– that is the second and third; and there is no other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The <i> Yugantar</i> was prosecuted on articles expressing its essential policy; the <i> Sandhya</i> has been proceeded against on articles expressing its views on important matters; but it was sought to crush the <i>Bande</i> <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="8.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> <i>Mataram</i> partly for a technical offence and partly on a side-issue.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>So eagerly, so carelessly is the casual chance given snatched at that the executive do not even trouble to know what is the article on which action is being taken; they give sanction to prosecute on an advertisement in the right-hand corner of the paper, and but for the compassionate correction vouchsafed by an officer of the Company the mistake would have had to be rectified in the course of the trial itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Sanction is given to prosecute a nameless Editor and the police at once proceed to ask for a warrant against Aurobindo Ghose.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>It is in evidence that they had nothing better to go on than hearsay.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But they had no hesitation in immediately pouncing on one particular writer of the <i>Bande Mataram</i> without possessing the least scrap of evidence against him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Obviously they cannot have done this without instructions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It was popularly believed that Srijut Aurobindo Ghose was all in all on the <i> Bande Mataram</i> staff, that all the best articles were written by him, that he gave the tone of the paper and that it could not last without him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Why did the police take a body-warrant against Aurobindo Ghose to the office and why, having taken it, did they not arrest him?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Obviously they took it because they thought that they would find plenty of evidence against him in the search, and they did not execute it because they found that not a scrap of proof rewarded their efforts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>After that there was a pause till Anukul Mukherji<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="533" href="#">3</a> testimony was secured, and on that flimsy evidence the trial was started.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Had it been honestly intended to deal only with the Editor, whoever he might turn out to be, the proceedings against Aurobindo Ghose would have been given up, but the police made no secret of the fact that it was this one man who was wanted and that no other, whatever the evidence against him, would be thought worth capture.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Even when the case for the prosecution was complete without any evidence fit to raise more than a flimsy presumption the Standing Counsel would not give up, but in an outrageous address in which he rode roughshod over the higher traditions of his office, pressed weak points and wrested ambiguous evidence to get the charge framed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>And after Anukul had broken down in cross-examination and made admissions fatal to their case, still <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="0.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="6.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> the prosecution struggled for a verdict.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>And with what result?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Even a civilian Magistrate willing to support the prestige of the Government had more sense of law and justice than the bureaucracy and its advisers and was able to see that a man could not be sent to two years’ rigorous imprisonment without any shadow of evidence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Their prey escaped them; the Manager who seems to have been arrested on spec and tried without even any pretence that there was any evidence against him was acquitted, and only an unfortunate Printer who knew no English and had no notion what all the pother was about, was sent to prison for a few months to vindicate the much-damaged majesty of the almighty bureaucracy.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1956"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The strong censures which the <i>Statesman</i>’s article on the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case has called forth from the Bengali Press in Calcutta, have forced that journal to enter into some explanation of its conduct.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>While professing to stand by every word it had written, it manages under cover of the plea that it has been misunderstood, to unsay much that it had said.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The article was on the face of it a malignant attack on the <i>Bande Mataram</i>, an attempt to create the impression that this paper was either a journal managed on a dishonest, disreputable and impossible principle or else that its staff were a gang of liars and cowards with an Editor who made a false or practically false defence in order to avoid the responsibility for his political propaganda.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We were told that from this dilemma there was no possible escape.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> has now considerably altered its tone.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>In order that we may not be accused of wilfully misinterpreting our very Liberal contemporary, we will give his explanation of his own meaning in his own words and answer him point by point.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>“We maintained”, he says, “that there had been in essence a miscarriage of justice in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case, since the trial had resulted in the conviction of the Printer, whereas the real offender – the author of the article or articles complained of – was not brought to book.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>We pointed out in the next place, that in England the person really responsible for the articles could readily have been found, for no attempt would have been made to evade the issue on the divided liability principle adopted in the <i> Bande Mataram</i> office, still less to make a scapegoat of an ignorant workman.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>We maintained lastly that unless every public journal had a responsible head of some sort, the liberty of the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 697</p>
<p class="PE"> Press would degenerate into a licence under which no institution of organised society, no man’s reputation would be safe.”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1957"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We do not for a moment deny that there was a very serious miscarriage of justice in the <i>Bande Mataram</i> case, but we are certainly astonished at the malignity of the <i>Statesman</i> in trying to fasten the responsibility for the Printer’s conviction on the <i>Bande Mataram</i> or on the other accused.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>It writes as if it were we who took out a warrant against the Printer, knowing him to be nothing but an ignorant workman, or who sentenced him to three months’ rigorous imprisonment in spite of the evidence that he knew nothing of the matter and could not have had any criminal knowledge or intention, or as if we had asked the Printer to take any responsibility upon himself for the articles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Does the Friend of India find anywhere in the records of the case or out of them either that any of the accused tried to shield himself by putting the responsibility on the Printer?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The blame for the miscarriage of justice must rest on the unjust British law which makes an ignorant workman responsible, on the bureaucrats who sanctioned his prosecution and on the Magistrate who sentenced him, and the attempt to fasten it on our shoulders is as grotesque as it is malicious.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The <i>Statesman</i> is, farther, much exercised because the real author of the offending article has escaped punishment, but this is not a calamity over which we can affect to be greatly grieved.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>After all, miscarriages of justice, whether in the shape of the conviction of innocent Indians or the immunity from punishment of European criminals, are not so rare in this country that society will be shattered to pieces because the writer of a chance letter disagreeable to the sacred feelings of the bureaucracy has not been sent to turn the oil-mill for a couple of years.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>“In England the person really responsible for the article could readily have been found.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>If the real writer is meant, we deny this altogether.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>In England it would be absolutely impossible to discover the true writer of an unsigned article, for it is not considered binding on him to come forward even if another suffers for his offence or his indiscretion; and when the <i>Statesman</i> claims a chivalrous sense of honour for English writers political or other and asserts that they always come forward </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 698</p>
<p class="PE"> to claim their handiwork it is trading on the ignorance of English life which is prevalent in this country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>If, on the other hand, the Editor is meant, we would advise our contemporary to study the history of the English Press more minutely.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>He will find that English editors have not always been so enamoured of legal penalties as to forego any opportunity of evading responsibility which the law allowed them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We will admit that ordinarily in England there is a single responsible head of some kind, though he is not always the writer of the articles, but this is not the case in every country nor with every newspaper, and we cannot admit that any such arrangement is necessary in the interests of society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>When the <i>Statesman</i> says that no man’s reputation is safe unless every paper has its one responsible head, it is talking and knows that it is talking pure nonsense.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>A man who thinks himself libelled has always his remedy in civil law and it cannot matter to him whether he gets his damages from the actual writer of the libellous matter or from the proprietor or from a company or syndicate owning the paper.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Was Mr. Lever’s reputation unsafe because his damages were paid by the Harmsworth Trust and not by the actual libeller?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If the proprietor happens to be a corporate body, the aggrieved person is no doubt deprived of the vindictive pleasure of sending his critic to prison, but we hardly think it can be said that society is mortally wounded by his loss.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>But of course what the <i>Statesman</i> is really troubled about is the safety of the bureaucratic groups who administer the country at present and whom it dignifies and disguises by describing as “institutions of organised society”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>This anxiety of the <i>Statesman</i>’s is rather humorous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy has armed itself with such liberal powers of repression that a journalist attacking it is like a man with no better weapon than a pebble assailing a Goliath panoplied from head to foot, armed with a repeating rifle and supported by howitzers and maxim guns.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>For a backer of the giant to complain because the unarmed assailant throws his pebble from behind a bush or wall is, to say the least of it, a trifle incongruous.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1958"><!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The gravamen of the <i>Statesman</i>’s charge, however, lies in the question it triumphantly posits at the end of its rejoinder as </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 699</p>
<p class="PE"> a final settler for its critics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The impugned “articles in the <i> Bande Mataram</i> must have been written by someone; is it courageous and honourable conduct on the part of their unknown author, this precious ‘patriot’, that he should elect to remain in hiding and let a poor unfortunate Printer go to jail in place of himself?”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>And our contemporary asks its critics either to affirm that it is right for a journalist to allow an innocent man to suffer in his place,– or else be silent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We admit our contemporary’s luminous suggestion that someone must have written the article “Politics for Indians” and the better to clear up the confusion of his ideas we will add that the someone must have been either a member of the staff or an outside correspondent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The evidence showed that he must have been the latter, and, if so, his conduct in not coming forward was in accordance with those traditions of English journalism by which the <i>Statesman</i> sets such store.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>It may not have been ethically the most heroic or exalted conduct possible, but it does not lie in the mouth of an Englishman to question it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>And we presume that the <i>Statesman</i> will not seriously suggest that it was our duty, even if we had recorded the name, to peach against a correspondent in order to save our own man, or that such a betrayal would have been either courageous or honourable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>If, on the other hand, the real writer were a journalist on the staff, he must have been someone other than Aurobindo Ghose to whom no one in his senses would attribute such a half-baked effusion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>He would then be one who was not accused and could only take the responsibility by giving evidence against himself as a witness for the defence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>No Englishman in a similar situation would have done it unless actually put in the witness box, but for an Indian patriot, we admit, it would have been the natural course if the Printer could have been saved by his self-devotion but it is perfectly obvious that the Printer would still have been liable under the statute and got his three months.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The imputation made by the <i>Statesman</i> is not true in fact, as it was an outside contributor who wrote the article, but even were it otherwise, it is absurd in theory.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It was the bureaucracy and the Magistrate who made a scapegoat of the Printer and not the <i>Bande Mataram</i> or anyone on its staff.<!--/SENT-->

Parallel</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1992"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We do not, as a rule, take excursions into foreign politics or like our special friend, the <i>Statesman</i>, fix an abstracted eye on the affairs of Germany and Russia while India is being convulsed with conflict and turmoil, but the struggles of Nationalism in other countries, especially in Asiatic or semi-Asiatic countries, have their interest for us and often present a close and informing parallel.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Despotic reaction is always the same in all countries and all ages and uses the same methods.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>One of these methods is for the police to use the disorderly and dangerous elements of society in order to put down the better elements whom the repression of noble aspirations has brought into conflict with the instruments of despotism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>In badly-governed countries like Russia, Turkey and India, the line of demarcation is very small between the police and the habitual criminal, the <i>budmash</i>, the hooligan whom it is their nominal duty to repress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The necessity of pampering the police so that they may be the faithful instruments of a small, unpopular and insecure ruling class in coercing and breaking the spirit of the great mass of the people, inevitably removes all moral restraint, the ever-present sense of duty, the fear of punishment and the abiding consciousness of being servants and not masters of the people, which can alone prevent such dangerous though necessary powers as those wielded by the police from becoming a curse instead of a protection to society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The almost universal habit of unpunished extortion and corruption, the free indulgence in insolence and brutality which are the hallmark of a serviceable Indian police, are not peculiar to them, but common to all despotically governed countries.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Such a police naturally become the patrons and protectors of the <i>budmash</i> element.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="pg-num">Page 713</p>
<p class="PE"> They keep it in control and punish individuals so far as suits their own purposes, so far, that is to say, as is necessary to keep the hooligan in terror and make him feel that the police is his master but if the hooligan is subservient and willing to pay for impunity, the police will wink at his anti-social pursuits and his particular offences and get the innocent punished the better to screen their proteges.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>These are facts of such common knowledge in India that they hardly repay repetition except in order to drive home a truth it has taken our politicians a long time to realise,– that no amount of commissions and paper reforms and new methods of recruitment and readjustments of the scale of pay will destroy or even mitigate the evil which is constitutional, congenital, ingrained, in the very system of government now obtaining in India and cannot be mended or ended unless that system of government is itself mended or ended.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Our present point, however, is that in countries where such relations obtain between the police and the habitual criminal, the latter can become a very useful instrument in dealing with political discontent, when the police itself is unable to cope with people, or for political reasons, it is thought advisable to screen partially or wholly their use of violent and illegal means of repression, or even when diplomatic considerations make it necessary that there should be a riot or tumult so that nationalism may be discredited or an excuse provided for benevolent intervention or philanthropic annexation or the other devices to which civilized international piracy has nowadays recourse.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>A still more remarkable and successful specimen, however has been recently revealed to us in Wilfrid Blunt’s remarkable book on the Secret History of English Occupation of Egypt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We shall have occasion to return upon the curious revelations made in this book as to the sinister and Machiavellian methods by which an Anglo-Indian official trained in the arts of government as practised in India, brought about the great act of piracy on the banks of the </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We confine ourselves at present to quoting the pointed remarks of historians in the <i> Indian Review</i> for September on the revelations of Wilfrid Blunt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Speaking of the riot which was made an excuse for British intervention he says: –<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1994"><!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>“There, it is clearly brought home to the unbiassed readers’ mind how Arabi was innocent of the premeditated Alexandrian riot, how Omar Pasha Lufte was the chief culprit, and how the gendarmerie and the police had deliberately purchased beforehand and distributed a large quantity of naboots or lathis to the lowest class of Arabs and Bedouins.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The evidence of unofficial and disinterested eyewitnesses has been also recorded to show that knives and bayonets which the police had supplied were the instruments by which people were killed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Ten European doctors who had examined the dead bodies at the hospital averred in their report that all the wounds were inflicted either by the lathis or the knives and the bayonets which were the arms of the police, and yet, strange to say, no proceedings had been taken against the police who took an active part in the riots, under the direct orders of the police prefect, killing many a Christian.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Mr. Blunt proves how Arabi Pasha was entirely guiltless in the matter, for while the riots raged most furiously there was “the utter absence in the streets of the soldiers of the regular troops,” who alone were under the command of that personage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The evidence of one Mr. Hewat, an English accountant, is exceedingly corroborative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>He had “no hesitation in saying that instead of suppressing the riot,” this police “did all in its power to increase it and their conduct on the occasion was most barbarous, violent and fanatical.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>And there is the personal testimony of so eminent a person of commercial reputation as the late Mr. Stephen Ralli of the great house of Ralli Brothers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>“To show the treachery of the authorities one has only to know the following – the street disturbance began at 3 o’clock, the policeman doing the most of the killing, until past 7 o’clock.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>But enough of these gruesome details.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a></p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 715</p>
<p class="PE"> They remind us of the part the Indian police has taken now and again in past years in promoting riots, suborning witnesses and perjuring themselves with impunity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The strangest part, however, of this deplorable affair is the persistent manner in which Earl Granville, the foreign minister, under the inspiration of the two men on the spot, endeavoured by hook or by crook, to fasten on Arabi Pasha the responsibility of the bloodshed caused by the riot when impartial European witnesses had testified that it was the police and the gendarmerie alone who had previously arranged for the affray and distributed staves and arms, and had actually done the butchering.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Says Mr. Blunt: “The English Government apparently only gave the idea of a preconcerted and deliberate massacre on the impossibility being forced on them of connecting Arabi with that event.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>This phase of the incident, too, is not unfamiliar to Indian people, namely, how the authorities have in the past strained every nerve to screen the actual instigators and wrong doers, namely, the police, and foist upon innocent men the origin of riots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But the dismal analogy does not end here.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>There is even a third fact which also has its counterpart in the experience of Indians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Mr. Blunt remarks: “The fact that no telegrams or messages between the Governor, Omar Lufti, and the Khedive, between the Khedive and Sir E. Malet, or between the Admiral and Sir E. Malet and the English Consulate, which must have been passing continually while the riots were proceeding, have been produced, is highly suspicious and requires explanation.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Have not Indians, too, been highly suspicious of the absence of important telegrams in Blue-books published months after the occurrence of events by Parliament under “responsible” Ministers so-called?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Blue-books in general never do contain letters and documents which are of a character to incriminate officials and reflect on the conduct and action of the highest authorities themselves.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 1995"><!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The parallel drawn so ably by historians, to which fresh point is lent by the disturbances in Calcutta, ends here.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>Protected hooliganism succeeded in Egypt because the circumstances were different and the Nationalism of the Egyptians at that time of a less robust and less exalted type.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>If it is tried in India, it cannot </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 716</p>
<p class="PE"> succeed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The Egyptian nationalists made the mistake of trying to accomplish their ends by diplomacy, by reliance upon European support and, when that failed them, by a military struggle between their armed force and the British intruders, without first awakening the people and inspiring them with the passion for liberty which can alone give a long-subject nation the strength to endure and survive, to thrive on disaster and overcome defeat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>The work of Mazzini must be done before the work of Cavour and Garibaldi can begin.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>In India the awakening has come, the passion for liberty is abroad, and we have the satisfaction of knowing that the fire we have kindled is unquenchable and the impetus given is one against which no human power can stand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>In Egypt Sir Charles Dilke and Mr. John Morley and their allies had only to create an excuse for armed interference and to crush a feeble military resistance in order that their nefarious work might be done.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>But to coerce indignation and resistance of a whole people is a more difficult task than to win battles, for here it is not the engines of war, but the engines of the spirit which decide the conflict, and when the motive power on one side comes from Heaven itself while the source is merely human, the task of despotism becomes an impossibility.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>All that they did was to baffle a very discreditable attempt to defy all constitutional procedure and public decorum in the interests of party trickery, and in doing so they were entirely right.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2015"><!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>A persistent attempt has also been made to prejudice the Nagpur Nationalists in the eyes of the country and obscure the real question by grossly misrepresenting their action with regard to the issue about the Presidentship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>By the rule formulated at last year’s Congress – a rule we have always considered foolish and unworkable – the local Reception Committee has to elect the President for the year by a three-fourths majority, and, if they cannot do so, the decision rests with the All-India Congress Committee.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>This arrangement is admirably conceived for swelling the Congress funds on the one hand and for defeating public opinion on the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The Reception Committee is not an elected or representative body but is constituted on a money basis, as anyone who can pay twenty-five rupees or get another to pay it for him can have his name enrolled as a member.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Whichever side has the longer purse can secure the election of the President of its choice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Such an election is no more likely to represent public opinion than Mr. Morley’s Council of Notables is likely to represent it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Like the Council of Notables it will represent the opinion of the monied<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="548" href="#">2</a> aristocracy, the men of position and purse, the men “with a stake in the country”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Nevertheless the rule is there and so long as it stands, it must be observed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The position in Nagpur as in the Deccan is this, that the Loyalist Moderate party is composed of the wealthy, successful and high-placed men, the retired officials, the Rai Sahebs </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 725</p>
<p class="PE"> and Rai Bahadurs, the comfortable professional men and those who pride themselves on their English education and Western enlightenment and look down with contempt on the ignorant masses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>On the other hand the young men and the poorer middle class form the bulk of the Nationalist party, although it contains a minority of the wealthier men.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The lines of divergence are therefore somewhat different from those in Bengal and the gulf between the two parties wider both in opinion and in spirit.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>In Bombay or Nagpur it would be perfectly impossible for a man like Sj.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="549" href="#">3</a> Surendranath Banerji to be a leader of the Moderates; he would be looked on with suspicion, continually checked, snubbed, thrust into the shadow and eventually forced out of the camp.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2016"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The struggle over the Presidentship in Nagpur followed lines necessitated by the character of the two parties.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The Moderates relied on the length of their purse, the Nationalists appealed to the people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>A few Moderates of wealth advanced money and filled the Reception Committee with men of their persuasion, who were therefore in a sense paid to vote for any President proposed by their wealthy patrons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The Nationalists on the other hand created a Nationalist organisation or Rashtriya Mandali and invited all who were willing to become members of the Reception Committee <i>on condition that Mr. Tilak became President</i> to send in the requisite sum, not to the Reception Committee but to the Rashtriya Mandali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>Eventually it was found that though the total sum raised by the Nationalists was much larger than that contributed by the Moderate magnates, yet the votes it represented fell short of three-fourths.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>It was decided, therefore, after paying in the sums sent in unconditionally to the Congress funds, to devote the rest to some Nationalist purpose, preferably the creation of a National School in Nagpur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>This decision has been deliberately misrepresented as a perversion of Congress funds and a refusal on the part of the Nationalist party to contribute their share of the Congress expenses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>The money was expressly sent in on the condition and with the proviso that the contributors would become members of the Reception Committee <i>only</i> if there was a certainty of Mr. Tilak’s being </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 726</p>
<p class="PE"> elected, and for this reason it was sent in to the Rashtriya Mandali and not to the Congress Committee as the latter could not accept conditional contributions.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>In the disposal of these monies therefore, Mr. Tilak not having been elected, the Congress has no concern whatever and the Moderate party less than none; it is a matter entirely between the Nationalist organisation and its contributors.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>To transfer the Congress to Madras or any other centre for the convenience of the Moderate party while there are men willing to hold it in Nagpur would mean a definite and final split in the Congress camp which would turn the Congress into a Rump of Loyalists and Moderates possibly with a Nationalist Assembly standing in opposition to it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>If Mr. Tilak is not elected, it does not matter to us, in the absence of Lala Lajpat Rai, whether Dr. Rash Behari Ghose or any other figurehead graces the Presidential seat, and this need not be a cause of further quarrel.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>He meets with the same callous disapprobation from all Englishmen alike, from the Liberal whose motto is “Government with consent” just as much as from the Tory whose principle avowedly is “let things be.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>On the Indian question the Englishman will tell you his position is that of a “patriot”, not of a “partisan”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Imperialism is far above party; every Englishman therefore is an Imperialist when he is thinking of the Indian question, he has then ceased to be either a Liberal or a Conservative.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>To this rule there are some exceptions, a few old ladies here and there (who however hardly count in politics yet), and some truly noble men who hold humanity far higher than Imperialism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>These men certainly frankly admit that England’s arbitrary and tyrannous tenure of power in India is a standing libel on herself, a gross violation of those political principles which she proclaims from the housetops to the whole of Europe.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2022"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The hasty, hideous, indecent, savage yell that has been raised by the whole of the English Press against Mr. Keir Hardie because he has dared to tell the truth about the present situation in this country is a striking confirmation of what we have said above, and what we stated before in the <i>Bande Mataram</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>We must not commit the mistake of supposing that the English Press is indignant because it doubts the truth of Mr. Hardie’s statements against the Indian Government; not that at all; they know very well, one and all of that yelling throng, that every word of what he has said is true, and that Reuter has wired a grossly mendacious version of his statements; but they are full of wrath because the leader of the Independent Labour Party has told the unvarnished truth respecting the character of the rule that England has established here.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>They are bursting with rage because their long and unscrupulously kept-up fiction of a just and benevolent Indian rule has been exposed in all its ugliness at last by one who happens to be an <i>Englishman</i>, (oh, the sting of it!) and an Englishman of power and prestige too, who easily has the ear of the civilised world.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>He is a traitor, shout the impious fraternity of the British Press, because he has the nobleness of mind, the honesty of conviction, to be able to tell the truth against his own country when he finds it attempting without a blush to perpetuate an outrage upon humanity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>He is no longer a statesman because he could not deliberately suppress a truth in consideration of the reasons of state, which in the present instance means, in the interest of the sickening British lie – repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> before Europe and America – that England governs India for the benefit of the Indians.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The paper which so often contains articles from the pen of Sir Henry Cotton joins in this infamous chorus of denunciation no less than the <i>Daily News</i> which always so overflows with the pure milk of undiluted Liberalism, that is to say British Liberalism.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If an Englishman with a disengaged mind has the courage to take up our cause, and tell the world the most elementary facts about the wrong England is doing us, his voice is drowned in the roar of the ruling nation whose one aim is mercilessly to exploit India and let the rest of the world know as little about their real Indian policy as possible, and even to deceive it whenever opportunity offers.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>How humane it sounded, how extremely Christian, when Lord Lansdowne declared in the House of Lords with that supreme unction of which Englishmen alone are capable, that one of <i>the</i> motives of the war with the Boers was the righting of the grievous wrongs to which “our <i> Indian fellow-subjects</i> were forced to submit in the Transvaal”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>That grandiose declaration was not without its effect in the international world, though we know only too well that the Transvaal Indians live under infinitely more humiliating conditions now than they ever did under the Government of Paul Kruger.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>And one need not feel surprised if one hears an Englishman, even at the present day, repeating the pronouncement of Lord Lansdowne in all solemnity in order to prove England’s constant anxiety and watchfulness on behalf of her Indian subjects.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2024"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>There can hardly be any doubt that the Press has been shamelessly encouraged in its campaign of foul misrepresentation against Mr. Keir Hardie by Mr. Morley’s speech at Arbroath.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The philosopher-Secretary betrayed not a little ruffling of his philosophic calm in his undisguisedly hostile and somewhat petulant references to Mr. Keir Hardie’s opinion that India should be given the same autonomy that is enjoyed by Canada.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The wonderful allegory of the fur-coat, though hardly giving us an encouraging indication of any power of imagination or perception, of any historical insight, of any sense of humour or relevancy on the part of its author, certainly furnishes abundant </p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2025"><!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But, after all, we perhaps do the Indian Secretary an injustice in charging him with lack of historical insight; in one sense, it may be said, he shows an abundance of it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>For we learn from Reuter, that “he paid a tribute to the courage, patience and fidelity of the House of Commons, from which he augured that the democracies were going to show their capacity to tackle difficult and complicated problems.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>The one remarkable feature of European democracies from the days of Athens to those of England, has throughout been that whilst they always most jealously keep vigil over the integrity of their own republican constitution, they revel at the same time in the despotic sway of unlimited power over the peoples they conquer.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>This is strictly true of the Pagan republics of Hellas and Rome as well as of the Christian communes and country-states of Mediaeval and Modern Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The ideal that has shaped the polity of Europe is always consciously or unconsciously Hellenic and not Hebraic; the Christian ideal of human brotherhood the European is apt to regard as part of the privilege of his citizenship, is<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="551" href="#">2</a> not to be extended to a conquered people.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>This is strictly true, the Christian missions and missionaries of Europe not withstanding.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>In other words Christian Europe flings her Christianity aside in her treatment of those who have had the misfortune to come under her rule; these she looks upon as Athens and Rome did on their subject peoples.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley whilst congratulating the English democracy on the determination they have shown to keep their Indian Empire their own, might very well have been feeling the secret glow of an historic enthusiasm in insensibly thinking of similar figures in ancient and modern European history extolling their countrymen on similar occasions.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2026"><!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>What we meant by taxing him with want of historic perception was that he has betrayed a sad ignorance of Asiatic history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Asia has never embraced an ideal without universalising it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>To profess the Christian faith and persist in confining the Christian ideal of human brotherhood to one’s own nation strikes the Asiatic as a monstrous hypocrisy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Nor, as we have had occasion </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 731</p>
<p class="PE"> to remark before, has an ideal had to win its way to the heart of the Orient through a welter of its martyrs’ blood, as has been the case with all kinds of ideals in Europe.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>This is the secret of the willingness and readiness with which the monarchies of Asia are democratising the constitutions of their country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>The period of English History dating from 1066 and ending with 1832, the Shah of Persia has had the magnanimity to summarise into a few years of Persian History.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>It is therefore that the average Indian who has studied England’s history and literature feels so extremely perplexed, and is just now beginning to feel indignant at her strenuous and persistent refusal to give India that liberty which she has so prized all through her history.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2027"><!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>England, on the other hand, and quite consistently enough, thinks she is rightly acting in withholding from the Indian the citizenship of the British Empire, for in so doing she is strictly in the wake of European tradition, and has the full justification of history as she has known and understood it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>And consequently John Morley hastens to remind Indians of the “weary steps” necessary before they can attain liberty, the weary steps that the countries of Europe have had to traverse before they secured it.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2032"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The difficulties experienced at Nagpur in bringing about the compromise which at one time seemed on the point of being effected, do not strike a mind outside the whirlpool of local excitement and controversy as either obvious or insurmountable; yet it is evident that so much importance is being attached to them as to seriously imperil the chance of a Congress session being held at all this year.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is imperative that some decision should be arrived at in the course of the next few days either one way or the other.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Both sides lay the blame of the failure to arrive at an agreement on its opponents.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The Nationalists say that the Moderate party will not accept any reasonable terms and the Moderates charge the Nationalists with backing out of the compromise on the question of the money subscribed to the Rashtriya Mandali.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>It appears that the Nationalists are willing to co-operate if Srijut Surendranath Banerji be nominated as President in lieu of Mr. Tilak.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The reasons for this proposal and its rejection are not far to seek.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Sj. Surendranath is recognised all over India as the acknowledged leader of one of the two great parties in Bengal, a man with a great name and a great following in the country and, what is more important from the Nationalist standpoint, one who, whatever vagaries his ideas of<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="552" href="#">1</a> policy may lead him into, is believed to be a thorough-going Boycotter and Swadeshist and in no sense a Government man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Dr. Rash Behari Ghose on the other hand is a dark horse in politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>All that the rest of India knows of him is that he is a distinguished jurist, the Chairman of last year’s Reception Committee and – a Legislative Councillor.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>None of these titles to distinction is sufficient to justify his being suddenly put forward as President </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 733</p>
<p class="PE"> of the National Congress; for the time has passed away, not to return, when appointment to the Legislative Councils, provincial or imperial, was sufficient to raise a successful man of intellectual distinction or social influence not before politically notable, to the position of a leader or at least a sort of Congress grandee entitled to the respect of the common herd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>A seat on the Legislative Council is nowadays an obstacle and not a help to leadership, a cause of distrust and not of trust: the man to whom the bureaucracy lends ear is not one whom the people can trust and follow, and one who consents to sit in a Council where he is not listened to and can command no influence, has not the self-respect and backbone which are necessary to a popular leader – in days of stress and struggle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>To us Nationalists a seat on the Council is not merely an obstacle but an absolute bar to popular leadership, for it means that the man has one foot in the enemy’s camp and one in the people’s.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>It is easy to understand therefore why the Nagpur Nationalists are opposed to the idea of Dr. Ghose’s Presidentship, specially as his political views are not understood nor has he, like Mr. Gokhale, a record of past services and self-sacrifice to set against the disqualification of a seat on the Legislative Council.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Nor is it difficult to understand why the Moderates of Nagpur have shied at the idea of Srijut Surendranath’s Presidentship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Moderatism of Western India is much more Loyalist than Moderate, unlike that of Bengal, where except in the case of a small minority Moderatism wears loyalty more or less loosely as a sort of cloak or garment of respectability than as an essential part of its politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>This tendency is exaggerated in places like the Central Provinces where before the Nationalist upheaval the pulse of political life beat dull and slow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>For a Moderate of the Nagpur Rai Bahadur type to be asked to take Surendranath as a substitute for Tilak is as if they were asked to exchange Satan for Beelzebub; both are to them, as to the <i>Englishman</i>, devils of Extremism, one only less objectionable than the other.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2033"><!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But the rights of this question are so simple that there is no excuse for allowing the Congress to break up over it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>If the Moderates want Dr. Rash Behari Ghose or any other Loyalist or </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 734</p>
<p class="PE"> Legislative Councillor as President they must be satisfied with their three-fourths majority on the Reception Committee and pay the bulk of the expenses of the session.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If they desire a larger co-operation on the part of the Nationalists, they should meet them halfway by accepting the nomination of Surendranath or any other President acceptable to both parties as a compromise.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>And if they will take neither course, they should leave it to the Nationalists to arrange for the holding of the Congress with Mr. Tilak as President.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>But for them to insist on the Rashtriya Mandali funds, raised on the clear understanding that they should only be devoted to Congress purposes if Mr. Tilak were nominated President, being given into their hands to hold a Congress with a Loyalist President in the chair is a preposterously childish and unreasoning obstinacy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>We cannot understand how the Rashtriya Mandali could take this step even if they wished, since it would be a distinct contravention of the condition on which the money was given and a misuse of public money.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>Yet it is because the Rashtriya Mandali will not comply with this unreasonable demand that the Moderates of Nagpur seem to have given the coup de grâce to the Nagpur session.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2037"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>While writing of the Nagpur imbroglio we have touched very lightly on the question of Mr. Tilak’s Presidentship, the dispute over which was the beginning and real cause of the discord at Nagpur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We regard this issue as one of immense importance and shall today try to make clear our position in the matter and the reasons why we attach such a supreme importance to it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The Bombay Moderates with their usual skill in the use of their one strong weapon, misrepresentation, have been writing and speaking as if the question of Mr. Tilak’s election to the President’s chair were a personal issue; they blame Mr. Tilak for not withdrawing from the field, talk of us as Tilakites and assume throughout that we are fighting for a man and not for a principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>If it were a personal matter, Mr. Tilak who has always been an unselfish and unassuming patriot, always averse to pushing himself or to figuring personally more than was necessary for his work, always a strong fighter for the success of his ideas and methods but never for his own hand, would be the first to obviate all discord by withdrawing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>But it is not a personal matter and Mr. Tilak has not himself come forward as a candidate for the Presidentship.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>His name was put forward last year by the Bengal Nationalists without consulting him and was again put forward this year as the embodiment of a principle.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>This being so, Mr. Tilak has no voice in the matter except as an individual member of the Nationalist party, and is not entitled to withdraw his name except with the consent of his party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>In fact his personal right of accepting or refusing the Presidentship can only arise when and if it is offered him by the local Reception Committee or the All-India Committee.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>That the Moderates should not be able to </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 737</p>
<p class="PE"> understand this is natural; their conception of a leader and the Nationalist conception of a leader are as the poles asunder.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Mr. Tilak by his past career, his unequalled abilities and capacity for leadership, his splendid courage and self-sacrifice, his services to the cause and the disinterestedness and devotion with which he used his influence, is naturally the most prominent of the Nationalist leaders, and our party looks up to his experience, skill, cool acuteness and moral strength for guidance on great occasions like the Congress session when it has to act as a single body.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>But our idea of a leader is not and will never be one whom we have to follow as an individual for his own sake, whether he is right or wrong; we follow him only so long as he is faithful to the principles of Nationalism and is ready to fight its battles in accordance with the collective will of the party.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2038"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>The question was first raised last year in Bengal when at a meeting of the Nationalists in Calcutta it was decided to suggest to the country the name of Mr. Tilak as President of the Calcutta Congress and in accordance with this decision Srijut Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="553" href="#">1</a> Chandra Pal, who was then touring in the Mofussil, was communicated with and asked to bring the question forward and take the sense of the public upon it in Eastern Bengal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We have never concealed the fact that this was deliberately done in order to throw down the gauntlet publicly to Loyalism, Anti-Swadeshism, Moderatism and every other <i>ism</i> which seeks to bring in foreign considerations and alloy or weaken the pure and uncompromising Nationalist creed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>The nomination of Mr. Tilak was a crucial point as between the two parties, for three separate reasons.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>At that time the country was divided between the Swadeshists on principle and the Anti-Swadeshists – or, let us say, “honest” Swadeshists of the Mehta-Watcha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="554" href="#">2</a> type and still more sharply between Boycotters and those who trembled at the very name of Boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>From this point of view, the attempt to secure Mr. Tilak’s nomination was an attempt on our part to have the Swadeshi-Boycott propaganda recognised on the Congress platform.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Secondly, there was and still is a small ring of Congress officials who treat the Congress as their own private property, decide in secret conclave what it shall do or not do, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 738</p>
<p class="PE"> and hand round the Presidentship among themselves and the occasional newcomers admitted to their ranks from the Legislative Councils, except when a live M.P. can be secured from England or a Mahomedan had to be nominated to demonstrate Hindu-Musulman unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The second object of the attempt to get Mr. Tilak nominated was to break through this oligarchic ring and establish the true nature of the Congress as no mere machinery to be engineered by a few wealthy or successful proprietors, but a popular assembly in which the will of the people must prevail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Thirdly, the opposition to Mr. Tilak and the attempt to force him always into the background arose largely from the feeling that Mr. Tilak’s views and personality are objectionable to the bureaucracy and that the nomination of a public man once convicted of sedition would deprive the Congress and, what was more important to Loyalists and leading<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="555" href="#">3</a> men of the Congress, of all chance of Government favour.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>But these very reasons which made the name of Mr. Tilak an offence and a stumbling-block to the Loyalists, imposed upon the Nationalist party the duty of bringing forward Mr. Tilak’s name year after year until he is elected.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Leadership in the Congress must no longer be regarded as a convenient and profitable road to appointments on the Bench and in the Government Councils but as a post of danger and a position of service to the people and it must depend on service done and suffering endured for the cause and not in the slightest degree on bureaucratic approval, and the national movement must be recognised as a sacred cause which exists in its own right and cannot consent to be regulated by the smiles and frowns of the bureaucracy which it is its first object to displace.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>These are the principles for which our party are contending when they insist on Mr. Tilak’s nomination and they are principles which are essential to the Nationalist position and are as living today as they were last year.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The question of Mr. Tilak’s Presidentship will be always with us until it is finally set at rest by his election, for until then we shall pass it year after year.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2039"><!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>But so far as the Nagpur session is concerned, the question no longer exists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The attempt to make this question wholly </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 739</p>
<p class="PE"> responsible for the difficulty is disingenuous and the demand that Mr. Tilak should throw over his own party by a gratuitous refusal to be President if ever he is asked, so as to reassure irreconcilable Loyalists in their fears, is absolutely preposterous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>The Nagpur Nationalists have put his name forward and they alone are competent to withdraw it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>But such withdrawal is not necessary.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>They have failed to secure the necessary three-fourths majority and they can therefore no longer insist on his name unless they are asked to hold the Congress with their own funds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>They are willing to withdraw in a body from the Reception Committee if the Moderates so desire; they are willing to co-operate on lines both definite and reasonable; and they are willing, if called upon, to hold the Congress with any Moderate President in the chair if the funds in Mr. Dixit’s hands are paid in.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>But they are not willing to misappropriate public money for the Congress funds and they are not willing to walk into the Loyalist trap by an admission of any personal responsibility for the disturbances that have taken place, in the shape of a guarantee that no disturbance of any kind shall take place at the time of the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Such a guarantee can only be given by those who were responsible for the rowdyism or instigated it, and this unwarrantable charge has already been emphatically denied by the leading Nationalists; to ask them to give a guarantee is to ask them to admit what they have already denied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>If therefore the Moderates insist on these preposterous conditions, the public will know whom they have to blame.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2043"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The decision of the All-India Congress Committee, holding its session appropriately enough not in any place of meeting suitable to its character as a public body but in “Sir Pherozshah Mehta’s bungalow”, has put the crown on one of the most discreditable intrigues of which even Bombay Loyalism is capable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We held our peace about the real meaning of the Nagpur affair so long as there was the remotest possibility of the sense of shame and decency reawakening among even a section of the Nagpur Loyalists, lest a too trenchant exposure of the whole intrigue might imperil that slender chance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>Now that the die is cast, it is time for us to speak our minds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>From the whole course of the Loyalist manoeuvres in Nagpur since the strength of the Nationalist party in the Central Provinces became apparent, it was quite evident that from the first the Loyalists had made up their minds under inspiration from Bombay to prevent the holding of the Congress at Nagpur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>To effect this object they were prepared to bring about a public scandal of the most shameful kind and bring discredit on the Congress if only their party might win a tactical advantage and, as the chief Moderate organ in Bombay frankly put it, keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It was in order to keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists that the session was originally arranged to be held at Nagpur and the prior claims of the Punjab ignored.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>For Nagpur was then supposed to be a sleepy hollow of politics, a happy-hunting-ground of Rai Bahadurs and Government pets and tame patriots with the official collar round their necks, where there was no fear of Mr. Tilak’s nomination becoming even a remote possibility and Sir </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 741</p>
<p class="PE"> Pherozshah Mehta might safely hope to retrieve the crushing blow his dictatorship had received at Calcutta.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The Congress cabal had, unfortunately for themselves, reckoned without the fiery energy and indomitable self-confidence which have always been the characteristics of Nationalism in every country and every age of its emergence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Nationalists of the Berar and Central Provinces took the work of proselytisation in hand and as the result of several tours undertaken by leading members of the party from town to town and village to village the sleepy hollow awoke to life, a great revolution of opinion was effected and Nationalism became in a few months a power to be reckoned with.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>It soon appeared that in Nagpur there was on one side the small body of wealthy, respectable and successful elders with their dependents, hangers-on and satellites and on the other side, behind a growing body of true patriots among the men of name and standing, the great bulk of the young men and the poorer middle class.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>When a trial of strength came over the question of Mr. Tilak’s nomination the Loyalists could muster a large body of votes on the Reception Committee only by the wealthy men paying for the admission of their dependents and hangerson, while even so against the Rs. 21,000 they could muster, the Rashtriya Mandali<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="556" href="#">1</a> was able to show a total of more than Rs. 30,000, representing what would have been a substantial majority of votes if the rule of a three-fourths majority had not been in force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It thus became apparent that the Nationalist party might easily command a majority of the local delegates and, since the place of session was within easy reach of Bengal and a strong body of Nationalist votes from the North, from Madras and from the Deccan might be expected, Loyalism was evidently in danger of a serious reverse compared with which its experiences at Calcutta might sink into insignificance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Nor was the outlook made rosier by the fact that there was on the Nagpur Executive Committee an active Nationalist majority led by a strong and fearless stalwart.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It had become imperative, if the primary object of Loyalist politics, “to keep the Congress out of the hands of the Extremists” and so avoid a rupture with the bureaucracy, was not to be hopelessly frustrated, either <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="4.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> to drive the Extremists out of the Executive Committee and turn it into a convenient instrument for Sir Pherozshah Mehta’s masterly manoeuvres or to transfer the Congress to a less central and thoroughly Loyalist locality where the Dictator’s will could reign supreme.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2044"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>From this point onward the hand of the great wire-puller behind the scenes can be observed in all the developments on the Nagpur stage.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Left to themselves there is little doubt that the two local parties would have come to some understanding; nor can it be for a moment supposed that the audacious and high-handed attempt at a shamelessly unconstitutional <i>coup d’état</i> on the 22nd September was conceived in the brain of so harmless and insignificant a personality as Mr. Chitnavis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>The attempt to expel Dr. Munje and his Nationalist colleagues from the Executive Committee was a failure because leonine tactics require a leonine personality to carry them through and Mr. Chitnavis was trying to wear the giant’s robe without possessing the bulk and sinews of the giant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But their failure and the disturbance that followed it served the alternative plan of the Loyalists.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>That disturbance was obviously not engineered by the Nationalist leaders since, their point having been gained, it could serve no purpose whatever and on the contrary might do them harm, as it was bound to give and did give the Loyalists a handle for discrediting the Nationalists and stood them in good stead as a convenient and always serviceable pretext for breaking the Nagpur session if every other trumped-up excuse should fail.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>The same guiding hand is seen in the skill with which the very success of the Rashtriya Mandali<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="557" href="#">2</a> was turned to the uses of the intrigue by the preposterous and cynical demand that the condition under which money had been paid into<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="558" href="#">3</a> it should be disregarded and a breach of faith with the public committed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Neither can we regard seriously the much advertised visits of Moderate leaders to Nagpur to effect a reconciliation, followed as they were by ostentatiously sorrowful and misleading telegrams to the effect that both sides refused to accept any compromise while the simple truth was that the Nationalists in their eagerness to have the session at Nagpur were making every time larger </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 743</p>
<p class="PE"> and larger concessions and it was the Loyalists who throughout showed themselves intractable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>It is not to be believed that if such influential peacemakers had been in earnest, the Nagpur Loyalists would have showed this spirit of inflexibility; it was obviously not a local product but made in Bombay, and all these attempts at conciliation were simply meant to prepare the public mind for the transfer to Surat which had already been decided on by the mastermind in Bombay.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile the wires were pulled at Surat and Madras and the Surat respectables and Mr. Krishnaswamy<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="559" href="#">4</a> Aiyar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="560" href="#">5</a> and his Mahajan Sabha danced to the skilful manipulation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We do not believe the Madras offer was anything but a feint, for Madras is much too near to Bengal and there is already a strong Nationalist party in the northern parts of that province; but to have only the single offer from Surat would have been to leave the whole intrigue too bare to the public eye.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Our belief is confirmed by the Bombay correspondent of the <i>Bengalee</i> who openly says that Madras was not chosen because there were men in Madras pledged to Extremist views.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Finally, the last act of the farce supplies the key to all that has gone before.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>An informal and unofficial representation from a minority of the Reception Committee is precipitately seized upon by the All-India Congress Committee, a meeting is announced not at Nagpur where the members might have gone into the matter on the spot and arranged a working compromise, but in Bombay and at Sir Pherozshah Mehta’s bungalow, as if the Committee and the Congress itself were Sir Pherozshah’s personal movable property; and instead of calling for a report of the Reception Committee or taking cognisance of the fact that there were citizens of Nagpur willing and able to reconstitute the Committee and hold the session as arranged at Calcutta, the Moderate majority records a predetermined decision to transfer Sir Pherozshah’s movable property to Surat at a safe distance from Bengal where the Loyalist position is as yet unbreached and there is no time for the Nationalists to instruct public opinion before the holding of the session.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2045"><!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The intrigue is now complete, to the huge delight of the <i>Englishman</i>, and officialdom is full of hope that Sir Pherozshah </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 744</p>
<p class="PE"> will this year save the British Empire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>For the Nationalists it should be a spur to redoubled efforts to spread their creed into every corner of the country so that Loyalism may nowhere find a secure resting place for its foot-soles.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>As to the Surat Pherozshah Congress it would be the logical course for us regarding the decision of the All-India Committee meeting as a misuse of the powers of that body, to abstain and allow the Loyalists to hold a purely Moderate Congress of their own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>The other alternative is to arrange forth with<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="561" href="#">6</a> the organisation of Nationalist propaganda in Gujerat and make full use of the opportunity such as it is which the session will provide.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>In either case a conference of our party is necessary, for, in view of the bureaucratic campaign on one side and the danger of a retrograde step on the part of the Congress on the other, the times are critical and concerted action imperative.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The Moderate legend of its origin is that it was the child of Lord Curzon begotten upon despair and brought safely to birth by the skilful midwifery of Sir Bampfylde.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Nationalism was never a gospel of despair nor did it owe its birth to oppression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>It is no true account of it to say that because Lord Curzon favoured reaction, a section of the Congress party lost faith in England and turned Extremist, and it is vain political trickery to tell the bureaucrats in their councils that it was their frown which created Extremism and the renewal of their smiles will kill it.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>The fixed illusion of these Moderate gospellers is that the national life of India is merely a fluid mirror reflecting the moods of the bureaucracy, sunny and serene when they are in a good humour and stormy and troubled when they are out of temper, that it can have no independent existence, no self-determined character of its own which the favour of the bureaucracy cannot influence and its anger cannot disturb.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Long before the advent of Curzonism and Fullerism, while the Congress was beslavering the present absolutist bureaucracy with fulsome praise as a good and beneficent government marred by a few serious defects, while it was singing hymns of loyalty and descanting on the blessings of British rule, Nationalism was already born and a slowly-growing force.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2056"><!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>Mr. John Morley is a very great man, a very remarkable and exceptional man.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>I have been reading his Arbroath speech again and my admiration for him has risen to such a boiling point that I am at last obliged to let it bubble over into the columns of the <i>Bande Mataram</i>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley rises above the ordinary ruck of mortals in three very important respects; first, he is a literary man; secondly, he is a philosopher; thirdly, he is a politician.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>This would not matter much if he kept his literature, politics and philosophy apart in fairly water-tight compartments; but he doesn’t.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>He has not only doubled his parts, he has trebled them; he is not merely a literary philosopher and philosophic litterateur, he is a literary philosopher-politician.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Now this is a superlative combination; God cannot better it and the devil does not want to.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>For if an ordinary man steals, he steals and there are no more bones made about it; he gets caught and is sent to prison, or he is not caught and goes on his way rejoicing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In either case the matter is a simple one without any artistic possibilities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But if a literary philosopher steals he steals on the basis of the great and eternal verities and in the choicest English.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2057">*</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2058"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>And so all along the line.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>An ordinary man may be illogical and silly and everybody realises that he is illogical and silly; but the literary man when he goes about the same business will be brilliantly foolish and convincingly illogical while the philosopher </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 752</p>
<p class="PE"> will be logically illogical and talk nonsense according to the strictest rules of philosophical reasoning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>An ordinary man may turn his back on his principles and he will be called a turncoat, or he may break all the commandments and he will be punished by the law and society,– unless of course he is an American millionaire or a member of the ruling race in India; – but the literary philosopher will reconcile his principles with his conduct by an appeal to a fur-coat or a syllogism from a pair of jackboots; he will abrogate all the commandments on the strength of a solar topee.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>A politician again will lie and people will take it as a matter of course, especially if he is in office, but a literary philosopher-politician will easily prove to you that when he is most a liar, then he is most truthful and when he is juggling most cynically with truth and principle, then he most deserves the name of Honest John; and he will do it in such well-turned periods that one must indeed have a very bad ear for the rhythm of a sentence before one can quarrel with his<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="569" href="#">1</a> logic.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Oh yes, a literary philosopher-politician is the choicest work of God,– when he is not the most effective instrument in the hands of the Prince of Darkness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>For the Prince of Darkness is not only a gentleman as Shakespeare discovered, but a gentleman of artistic perceptions who knows a fine and carefully-worked tool when he sees it and loves to handle it with the best dexterity and grace of which he is capable.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>He is not so great a man as his master Gladstone who was the biggest opportunist and most adroit political gambler democracy has yet engendered and yet persuaded himself and the world that he was an enthusiast and a man of high religious principle.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The first was when he championed the cause </p>

<p class="PE"> of the financiers in Egypt, the men who gamble with the destinies of nations, who make money out of the groans of the people and coin into gold the blood of patriots and the tears of widows and orphans,– when abusing his influence as a journalist, he lied to the British public about Arabi and urged on Gladstone to crush the movement of democratic and humanitarian Nationalism in Egypt, the movement in which all that is noble, humane and gracious in Islam sought fulfilment and a small field on earth for the fine flowering of a new Mahomedan civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The second is now when he is trying in the sordid interests of British capital to crush the resurgent life of India and baffle the attempt of the children of Vedanta to recover their own country for the development of a revivified Indian civilisation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The two foulest crimes against the future of humanity of which any statesman in recent times could possibly have been guilty, have been engineered under the name and by the advocacy of honest John Morley.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>No man better fitted than he to prove that when the noblest human movements are being suppressed by imprisonment and the sword, it is done in the interests of humanity; that when a people struggling to live is trampled down by repression, pushed back by the use of the Gurkha<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="571" href="#">3</a> and the hooligan, the prison walls and the whipping-post into the hell of misery, famine and starvation, the black pit of insult, ignominy and bonds from which it had dared to hope for an escape, the motive of the oppressor finds its root in a very agony of conscientiousness and it is with a sobbing and bleeding heart that he presses his heel on the people’s throat for their own good; that the ruthless exploitation and starvation of a country by foreign leeches is one of the best services that can be done to mankind, the international crimes of the great captains of finance a supreme work of civilisation and the brutal and selfish immolation of nations to Mammon an acceptable offering on </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 754</p>
<p class="PE"> the altar of the indwelling God in humanity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>But these things have been done and said before; they are the usual blasphemous cant of nineteenth century devil-worship formulated when Commerce began to take the place once nominally allowed to Christ and the ledger became Europe’s Bible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley does it with more authority than others, but his own particular and original faculty lies in the direction I indicated when drawing the distinction between the ordinary man and the extraordinary Morley.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>What he has done has been after all on the initiative of others; what he has said about it is his own, and nothing more his own than the admirably brilliant and inconsequential phrases in which he has justified wickedness to an admiring nation.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2064"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Man has been defined sometimes as a political animal and sometimes as a reasoning animal, but he has become still more pre-eminently a literary animal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>He is a political animal who has always made a triumphant mess of politics, a reasoning animal whose continual occupation it is to make a system out of his blunders, a literary animal who is always the slave of a phrase and not the least so when the phrase means nothing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>The power of the phrase on humanity has never been sufficiently considered.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The phrase is in the nostrils of the vast unruly mass of mankind like the ring in the nose of a camel.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>It can be led by the phrasemaker wherever he wishes to lead it.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Now Mr. Morley is an adept in the making of phrases which seem to mean something.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2065">*</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2066"><!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Take for instance his phrase “My<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="572" href="#">4</a> anchor holds.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley complains that he who has served Liberalism so long and so well, is not allowed to be illiberal when he likes, that when he amuses himself with a little reaction he is charged with deserting his principles!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>“It is true, gentlemen,” says Mr. Morley, “that I am doing things which are neither liberal nor democratic; but, </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>Yes, gentlemen, I dare to believe that my anchor holds.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>So might a clergyman detected in immorality explain himself to his parishioners, “It is true I have preached all my life continence and chastity, yet been found in very awkward circumstances; but what then?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>My anchor holds.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>Yes, dear brethren in Christ, I dare to believe that my anchor holds.”<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>So argues Mr. Morley and all England applauds in a thousand newspapers and acquits him of political sin.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2067"><!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>But of course Mr. Morley’s crowning mercy is the phrase about the fur coat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>It is true that the simile about the coat is not new in the English language; for a man who abandons his principles has always been said to turn his coat; but never has that profitable manoeuvre been justified in so excellently literary and philosophic<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="573" href="#">5</a> a fashion before.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_51"><!-- --></a>Mr. Morley has given us the philosophy of the turncoat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_52"><!-- --></a>“Principles”, he has said in effect, “are not a light by which you can guide your steps in all circumstances, but a coat which is worn for comfort and convenience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_53"><!-- --></a>In Canada, which is cold, you have to wear a fur coat, there is no help for it; in Egypt which is hot, you can change it for thin alpaca; in India where it is very hot indeed, you need not wear a coat at all; the natives of the country did not before we came and we should not encourage them to go in for such an uncomfortable luxury.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_54"><!-- --></a>It is just so with principles, democratic and other.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_55"><!-- --></a>The reasoning is excellent and of a very wide application.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>For instance it may be wrong in England to convict a political opponent for political reasons of an offence of which you know him to be innocent and on evidence you know to be false, or to sentence a man to be hanged for a murder which you are quite aware somebody else committed, or to disregard the plainest evidence and allow a bestial ravisher to go free because he happens to be a hog<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="574" href="#">6</a> with a white skin, but it is absurd to suppose that such principles can keep in </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_57"><!-- --></a>It is difficult to know what iniquity<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="575" href="#">7</a> reasoning of this sort would not cover.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_58"><!-- --></a>“I thoroughly believe in the ten Commandments,” Caesar Borgia might have said in his full career of political poisonings and strangulations, “but they may do very well in one country and age without applying at all to another.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>It is not an unmixed and fearless policy of repression, yet the repression, wherever entered on, is as thoroughgoing, ruthless and without scruple as the most virulent advocate of the strong hand could desire.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>It is not a policy of frank and wise concession, though concessions of a kind are fitfully made with no very apparent rhyme or reason.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>A Coercion Act is put upon the Statute-book of the most thoroughly Russian severity; it is supposed to be passed in hot haste to meet a crisis of an exceptional kind and to be urgently and imperatively demanded by the Chief Bureaucrats of three provinces who decline to be responsible otherwise for the preservation of peace and the British rule within their respective jurisdictions; yet when it has been passed, it is only applied to a single district in the whole of India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The protests of Moderate politicians against the deportations and their urgent pleas for the release of the prisoners in Mandalay are brushed aside with contempt, yet the very next news is that Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh are released and on their way homeward.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Simla, vowing it will ne’er consent, has consented.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>On the other hand Liakat Hussain<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="577" href="#">1</a> is pursued with relentless severity, a politically-minded High Court Bench discharges with a contemptuous impatience the appeals brought before it in political cases, and the wholesale persecutions of young men in the mofussil centres and the campaign against the Nationalist Press does not relax.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The official explanation given by the <i>Englishman</i> is that the Extremists have collapsed, Sir Pherozshah Mehta is once more master of the situation, the Moderate party has come suddenly by its own </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 758</p>
<p class="PE"> and the Government recognising its own victory and the victory of its friends, is willing and can afford to be generous.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>With all respect to Hare Street we will offer another explanation which we think will be found nearer to the mark.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2074"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The policy of the Anglo-Indian bureaucrats has always been checked by their strong sense of the weakness of their position in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>They know perfectly well that if the whole population of India gets to be infected by the enthusiastic beliefs and insurgent spirit of Nationalism, their present absolute sway over the country will at once become an impossibility.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>They know that the almost universal conversion of the educated class to Nationalism is a contingency of the near future and that Nationalism having once taken possession of the educated class must immediately proceed to invade the masses; such a consummation is sure to be immensely hastened by a policy of unflinching repression which will alienate the whole educated community.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The bureaucracy have indeed no love for the educated class, and the policy dearest to their hearts would be to create in the masses a counterpoise to the intellectuals, such as another bureaucracy once hoped to create in Russia.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It is not likely that they will fix any permanent hope, still less their main hope, on the policy of setting Hindu and Mahomedan by the ears by an unstinted pampering of the latter community, however thoroughly they may have resorted to that expedient in the terror of the moment; for by doing so they will not only help to weld the Hindu population into a homogeneous whole, but they will be creating a new and dangerous power in the country in a Mahomedan community excited by new hopes and eager to recover their old ascendency.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>On the other hand, the masses under present circumstances are not easily accessible to a foreign and unsympathetic handful of aliens chiefly known to them through a corrupt, brutal and cruelly oppressive police, while the work of educating them into loyalty will take a long time and may be no less a failure in the end than the old plan of creating a permanently loyal middle class as a support to foreign rule against the regrets of the aristocracy and the possible fanaticism of the masses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Awaiting therefore the launching and success of their experiment with the masses the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 759</p>
<p class="PE"> bureaucrats would like to keep the more pliable portion of the educated classes as long as possible in their own hands and set them against Nationalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But they are not prepared to purchase this support at the sacrifice of any least fragment of their absolute authority and irresponsible power; they are only willing to appease the rising unrest by sham concessions or any temporary and isolated step which will not affect their prestige or their authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The difficulty is that with the exception of the Loyalist section of the Moderate party led by men like Sir Pherozshah Mehta, no one would be satisfied with apparent concessions sufficient only to meet the claims of the wealthier upper ten of the educated community to titles, honour and position; the more advanced section which places patriotism before loyalty demands<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="578" href="#">2</a> in addition such a substantial concession as would in their opinion pave the way for complete self-government in the future; but this the bureaucracy are not prepared to concede.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Yet the Loyalists are precisely those whose support is least worth having.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Really strong in commercial centres like Bombay and Surat, wearing an appearance only of strength, in other parts where Nationalism has not yet put forth a strength, it is a waning force constitutionally prone to inertia and incapable of exciting enthusiasm.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2075"><!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Such is the position which the bureaucrats have to face, and once we realise it their policy becomes quite coherent and intelligible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>They have to be prepared against the possibility of the flood of Nationalism submerging the whole country in spite of all the dams they may erect, and for this reason they are arming themselves with extraordinary powers which will enable them to check its future expansion and crush it where it has already established itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>At the present moment they hope to get it under without persisting in a general repression which would drive the whole educated community into the Nationalist camp.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>They have got Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="579" href="#">3</a> Pal and Liakat under lock and key, Brahmabandhab is dead, Aswini<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="580" href="#">4</a> Dutta may be paralysed by a rigorous enforcement of the new Act in Bakarganj<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="581" href="#">5</a>, and of all the more powerful Nationalist speakers and writers one or two only have so far escaped the attack made upon them.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="PE"> bureaucracy may well hope that the back of the movement is broken and relax their legal thumbscrew, at least until they have seen what Sir Pherozshah can do at Surat.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Any fresh development of Nationalism they are prepared to meet by ruthless repression.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>Wherever they see it spreading itself by open propaganda, they will forth with<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="582" href="#">6</a> apply the Gagging Act; wherever it spreads by its own force without the aid of the platform they will attack it through the young men as at Rangpur, Dinajpur, Dacca and Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="583" href="#">7</a>, and whatever leader or active propagandist comes forward, they will find some pretext to thrust into prison.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Meanwhile they will pursue their policy of isolating the movement, locally by crushing it where it is bold and vehement while they will play with and indulge it for a time where it is milder and more cautious, politically by setting all other forces in the country against it.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2076"><!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>This is their second line of defence, to find for themselves as many points of support as possible against Indian Nationalism amongst the Indians themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Their first hope is in the Mahomedans whom they will encourage enough to buy their hostility to the Hindus, but not enough to make them really powerful or give an impetus to a Mahomedan revival.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Their second hope is in the landed aristocracy whom they broke and ground into the dust with the aid of the newly created middle class and would now call in in their turn to help in crushing that very middle class grown too powerful for its creator.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Their third hope is in the masses whom they expect to dominate partly by a carefully conceived primary education, partly by decentralising their administration sufficiently to give the District Officer direct touch with and autocratic control over the peasantry and partly by creating in officially controlled Panchayats<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="584" href="#">8</a> instruments of check and supervision among the masses themselves.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>Their fourth point of support is in the Loyalist-cum-Moderate party in the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is to keep the way open for a reconciliation with that party that Lajpat Rai has been released, the Gagging Act kept in abeyance outside Bakarganj<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="585" href="#">9</a> and overtures made in the demi-official Press, notably in such foul-mouthed revilers of all educated India as the <i>C.

<p class="pg-num">Page 761</p>
<p class="PE"> more sensible and sober elements in the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The word has gone round to rally the Moderates to the Government and that party is notified by act and word that if they will accept the olive branch, be even temporarily satisfied with Mr. Morley’s reforms and dissociate themselves from Boycott, Swaraj and Extremism, the bureaucracy will not confound them in one common ruin with the Extremists, but on the contrary give them its paternal blessing and a fair number of new playthings.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2077"><!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Such is the complete Minto-Morley policy as it now stands developed, and nobody will deny that, subject to the incurable defects of the bureaucratic position in India and the overruling decrees of Providence, it is a well-planned and skilful policy.<!--/SENT-->

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">About Unity</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2081"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>Our esteemed contemporary, the <i>Bengalee</i>, has recently been reading us eloquent sermons on the uses and advantages of unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We confess we cannot follow our contemporary’s argument.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>We gave utterance to the very obvious and, we thought, undeniable sentiment that unity is a means and not an end in itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>But the <i>Bengalee</i> asserts, and it has now got the strong authority of Mr. Myron Phelps to back it, that unity is an end in itself and not a means, but it seems to us that neither our contemporary nor his authority has<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="586" href="#">1</a> anything but their <i>ipse dixit</i> to prove their assertion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>We have great respect for Mr. Myron Phelps who is evidently a sincere well-wisher of our nation, but it does seem to us that he is forgetting the history of his own country when he asserts that unity is an end in itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>The end his countrymen aimed at during their quarrel with England was certainly not unity but independence, and to the attainment of that end there was a strong loyalist minority opposed and unfriendly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Even among the American Liberals the democratic Extremists were a minority while the greater number would have been glad to combine submission to the English crown with American liberty.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It was the fiery vehemence and energy of the Extremists aided by the intensity of popular indignation which hurried the Moderate majority into the Boycott and the same force which plunged them half against their will into war with the suzerain and into ultimate democracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The same thing has happened in India, for there is not the slightest doubt that the Moderates have been carried at the fiery chariot-wheels of Extremism into the perpetuation of the Boycott and the angry struggle between people and bureaucracy from which they would have gladly </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 763</p>
<p class="PE"> withdrawn and more than once made motions to withdraw, if left to themselves.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2082"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>We insist that the end of national action is the acquisition and maintenance of national independence and greatness, and unity is only a means to that end.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Moreover, political unity which is an essential condition of independence differs from unity of ideas and methods which are not essential.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Political unity can be prepared by men of all parts of the country joining in a common struggle for the creation of a single national government, but the other unity is only possible if the whole nation is inspired by one spirit and one idea.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> thinks there is substantially such an<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="587" href="#">2</a> unity between, say, Sir Pherozshah Mehta, Srijut Surendranath Banerji and Srijut Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="588" href="#">3</a> Chandra Pal; but we have our doubts.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>Surendra<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="589" href="#">4</a> wants Colonial Self-government, Pherozshah would be hugely pleased with something infinitely less; Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="590" href="#">5</a> Chandra wants absolute autonomy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>Where is the unity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>If Colonial Self-government for India, that political monstrosity, means anything, it means a hampered and provincial autonomy; the Nationalists strive for a complete and international autonomy, and if our contemporary thinks that is a small or merely academic difference, we cannot compliment him on his knowledge either of history or politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>We will admit however for the sake of argument that our aim is identical, though in one case frankly expressed and in the other hidden under a veil, but that our methods are different.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>How then can there be that unity of action for which the <i>Bengalee</i> so sonorously but hazily pleads?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Unity of action along with and unaffected by difference of methods is a kind of unity which we do not understand, and we rather suspect it is a chimaera<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="591" href="#">6</a> from the land of confused ideas very much on a par with the “Colonial Self-government for India” of our friends or Mr. Morley’s wonderful reconciliation of a free Press and Platform with an autocratic government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>If one party has petitioning for its method and another rejects it for passive resistance, how can there be unity of action?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Or if one party insists on association with and opposition to the bureaucracy (another twy-natured and self-contradictory figment from dreamland) and the other repudiates the association, how </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 764</p>
<p class="PE"> can there be united action?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>If united action is at all possible in Bengal, it is because the Moderate party in Bengal has ceased to be wagged by its loyalist tail and is now following the lead of its small but advanced head which is in sympathy with many of the Nationalist ideas though it is not prepared to carry them to their complete and logical end with the thoroughness and audacity which true Nationalism requires.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The Moderates have given up for the present the policy of mendicancy, they have given their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="592" href="#">7</a> adherence to the programme of passive resistance though only in part.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>So far therefore as the methods of the two parties agree, united action is possible, though difference of fundamental ideas and difference of spirit make it impossible for that concord to be real and wholehearted, even if personal misunderstandings and dislikes did not stand in the way.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>But it is only in Bengal that even so much unity is possible, though there is a tendency in that direction in Madras.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>In the rest of India Moderatism is in its public professions and actions frankly loyalist and is quite prepared to eject the Nationalists from the Congress so far as it can be done with safety to itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The Nagpur affair and the action of the All-India Congress Committee prove that beyond doubt.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Where then is the basis of unity?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>For that matter, the Bengal Moderates while they sing dulcetly to us the praises of unity, have invariably joined heartily in Loyalist attempts to suppress the voice of Nationalism in the Congress.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>They were, we are convinced, consenting parties to the unconstitutional political trickery by which Sir Pherozshah transferred the meeting place of the Congress to one of his own pocket boroughs.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Again we ask, on what ground can we meet for heartily united action?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>We have our work to do and cannot wait for ever on sweet words and professions used as a veil for secret – well, shall we say, diplomacy?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>We are ourselves anxious to carry the support of our Moderate countrymen with us in our struggles, but their friendship must first become less of the “I love you and kick you downstairs” kind than it is at present.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>Sincerity has great healing properties and without it professions are a poor salve for old sores.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">More about Unity</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2090"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> has again returned to the charge about unity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The line of argument adopted by our contemporary savours strongly of the peculiar style of political thinking which underlay all our movements in the last century.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The old school of politics was chiefly remarkable for a blithe indifference to facts and an extraordinary predilection for vague abstractions which could not possibly apply to the conditions with which our political action had to deal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>The nineteenth-century Indian politician never cared to study history, but used a ready-made and high-sounding philosophy of politics based chiefly on the circumstances and conditions of modern English politics which had no validity at all for India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>The result of this divorce from real life was a tendency to use words without caring to consider their real practical meaning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>We find the <i>Bengalee</i> in its article learnedly repeating these old mistakes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It builds wordy arguments from the terms of modern Science without grasping the true facts and hard realities of life, without a knowledge of which the terms cannot be correctly applied.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It argues from evolution that progress is an ever-increasing unity of ever-developing parts, that therefore progress is nothing but unity, freedom is nothing but unity, greatness is nothing but unity, ergo<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="593" href="#">1</a> unity is not a means but an end, not an important or necessary help to arriving at progress, freedom and greatness but itself at once progress, freedom and greatness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>This is merely playing with words.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The question is, what is this unity which the <i>Bengalee</i> makes so much of and which it asks us to prefer to our principles and in its name to join in action which we believe to be harmful to the country?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>If our contemporary means political unity, the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 769</p>
<p class="PE"> formation of all the communities and races in the country into a single political organism with a common centre of life, that is certainly, as we have already admitted, a necessary condition of independence and greatness; but it is a thing of the future which is impossible so long as the centre of life in the country is alien and external, and all we can do towards it is to unite people of all communities and races in one common struggle to replace the alien and external centre of political life by an indigenous and internal centre in the national organism itself.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2091"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Very good, but the question still remains, by what method can that result be attained?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>We believe the methods proposed by the Loyalists to be futile and injurious, we understand their aim to be not the independence of the national organism, but an impossible scheme of two centres of political life controlling the country at the same time of which the alien shall be supreme<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="594" href="#">2</a> and yet the indigenous shall be free!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>What the <i>Bengalee</i> asks of us is to disregard this vital difference of opinion and aim and be united,– in what?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>In aiming at an object which we believe to be absurd, by means which we believe to be futile.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It does not matter, says the <i>Bengalee</i>, in what we are united, so long as we are united; for unity is progress, unity is freedom and greatness.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>So that if we are united in petitioning we are by the very fact of that unity free and great!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The error of the <i>Bengalee</i>’s argument is that it confuses political unity, which is a necessary condition of independence, with unity of opinion and action, which is an immense help if the opinion and the action are in the right direction, but certainly not indispensable.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It is not true that unity, even political unity, is identical with freedom, for a nation may be united in bondage or united in submission to a foreign and absolutist rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Still less is it true that unity in following the wrong road is the true means to the goal, much less the goal itself.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>We tried to prove from history that nations had been made free not by a scrupulous pursuit of unanimity or of unity in action but by faith, energy and courage in a number of its more energetic sons carrying away the bulk of the nation into a strenuous effort to reach a great ideal.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>For the sake of brevity we gave one instance where we might have given </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 770</p>
<p class="PE"> a dozen.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The <i> Bengalee</i>, however, like all Moderate politicians, will have nothing to do with history or at least with the facts of history.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>History, it says in effect, is a record of human error, and the methods of which it tells us, involve great waste.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>So we in India are to invent something brand new, an ingenious and carefully calculated method of revolution which will bring us freedom and greatness without any waste, without any risk, by a minimum expenditure of trouble, disturbance and sacrifice.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>We fear it has left out of consideration the fact that waste also is one of Nature’s methods, indeed that what<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="595" href="#">3</a> we call waste is one of the most subtle parts of her economy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>No man or nation that refused to venture hugely like a gambler for huge ends ever arrived at freedom, none who has not been prodigal of his best has ever risen to greatness, and what has been in the past will be in the future; for human nature and the laws of human action remain the same, and cannot be new-shaped in Colootola.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Politics is for the Kshatriya and in the Kshatriya spirit alone can freedom and greatness be attained, not by the spirit of the Baniya trying to buy freedom in the cheapest market and beat down the demands of Fate to a miser’s niggard price.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>That which other nations have paid for freedom we also must pay, the path they have followed we also must follow.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>And if you will not learn from history, you will have to be taught by a harsher teacher the same lesson – and taught perhaps at a much more tremendous price than that which you stigmatise as waste.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>We Nationalists have no desire to break the Congress or to part company with our less forward countrymen, but we have our path to follow and our work to do, and if you will not allow us a place in the assembly you call National, we will make one for ourselves out of it and around it, until one day you will find us knocking at your doors with the nation at our back and in the name of an authority even you will not dare to deny.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The menu began with relishes and proceeded through the wedded delights of ice-pudding and liqueurs to a regale of confidences and confessions by Sir Harvey Adamson which was perhaps the most enjoyable dish of the evening.<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2097"><!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Of course Sir Harvey talked of the unrest, but his speech was eminently restful; it had all the large benevolence, sweet reasonableness and placid self-satisfaction of a man who had legislated as he had dined, wisely and well.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>It reeked of the olives and turtle soup and bannocks o’ barley meal, it had the generous flavour of the liqueurs and the champagne.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>If after that the educated class does not feel satisfied in its aspirations, if it does not feel as full-fed and happy as Sir Harvey after his haggis, well, they are ungrateful brutes and there is an end of it.<!--/SENT--></p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Sir Harvey is naturally shocked at so gross an imputation against his benevolent Government.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>All that the Government desires is to make the representation of the lawyers and educated men a “fair” representation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It does not want to exclude educated men, but only to swamp them with zamindars<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="598" href="#">3</a>, Mahomedans and Europeans; and it does not want to “suppress the middle class” but only to reduce them to a nullity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>And this because they will not have “what is scornfully known in the East as a vakil-ridden country”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It was evidently the generosity of the </p>

<p class="PE"> champagne that made Sir Harvey expand all India into the East.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We are not aware that the vakil class as it exists in India is to be found anywhere except in India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>It is the happy result of British rule in this favoured land that the nation now consists of a huge mass of starving peasants, a small body of dumb Government servants, and sweated office clerks, a landed aristocracy habitually overawed, fleeced and for the most part well advanced on the road to ruin, a sprinkling of prosperous middlemen and as the only independent class a handful of lawyers, journalists and schoolmasters.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>That is what Sir Harvey calls a vakil-ridden country.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But no doubt when he talks of the East, Sir Harvey means himself and his brother Scots out to make money in the East, just as by Indian trade is always meant Anglo-Indian trade and by Indian prosperity the prosperity of Anglo-India.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_56"><!-- --></a>“I and my Father in Simla are one,” the local official may now say, “and he who blasphemeth against me blasphemeth against him.”<!--/SENT-->

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2112"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>The policy of the bureaucracy in the face of the national movement, so far as it is anything more than crude repression, is a policy of makeshifts and dodges, and, though skilful in a way, it shows throughout an extraordinary ignorance of the country they rule.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The latest brilliant device is an attempt to reshuffle the constituent elements of Indian politics and sort them out afresh on the basis not only of creed, but of caste.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The <i>Pioneer</i> has come out with an article in its best style of businesslike gravity, in which it settles the basis on which representation should be given to India.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>For two years of unrest have brought us so far that Anglo-India is awakened to the necessity of giving some kind of representation to the Indians, and petty details of administrative reform, the demand for which was then considered as much a crying for the moon as the cry for Swaraj nowadays, are fast coming into the range of “practical politics”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Great are the virtues of unrest!<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Of course it is only representation and not representative government which Anglo-India is bending itself to think within the range of possibility; for government means control and control is the last thing which they will consent to yield to us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>When Viceroys and Law Members talk of giving us a larger share in the government of our country, they mean of course not control but what they call a voice, and they will take good care that this voice shall be <i>vox et praeterea nihil</i>, a voice and nothing more.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>But even a voice may be a serious inconvenience to an absolute government and pains are therefore to be taken to substitute an echo for a voice, an echo of bureaucratic whisperings for the living utterance of a nation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>In the representative institutions which the bureaucracy are likely </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 778</p>
<p class="PE"> to give us, it is the drone of many notables and the mechanical squeaking of officially manipulated puppets that we shall hear, and this, the world will be told, is the voice of the Indian people.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2113"><!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>But Anglo-Indian statesmanship will not rest satisfied with reducing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="605" href="#">1</a> the ineffective voice with which they desire to delude our aspirations, to the character of a flat and foolish echo; they will farther make every arrangement to turn it into a source of fresh weakness to the growing nationality instead of a source of strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>They began of course, long ago, the attempt to make capital of the religious diversities of Indian society and recently the policy of setting the Mahomedans as a counterpoise to the Hindus has been openly adopted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>In the new Legislative Councils the Mahomedans are to have representation not as children of the soil, an integral portion of one Indian people, but as a politically distinct and hostile interest which will, it is hoped, outweigh or at least nullify the Hindus.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The bureaucratic Machiavels have not realised that the conditions of the new struggle which has begun, are of so different a kind from any yet known in British India that the Mahomedans cannot be turned into an effective tool in the hands of the bureaucracy without becoming at the same time a danger to the artisan of discord who uses them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>For the field of the struggle is not nowadays in Simla or on the floor of the House of Commons or on any lists where outside opinion can have a decisive or even a material influence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>It is not a voice which they have to set against a voice or a show which they have to outface with a better show, but a force which they will have to call into being to oppose a force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The Hindus have become self-conscious, they have heard a voice that cries to them, “Arise from the dead, live and follow me,” and they are irresistibly growing into a living and powerful political force.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>Unless the Mahomedans can be built up also into a self-conscious, living and powerful political force, their assistance to the rulers will be a mere handful of dust in the balance.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But the moment they become a living and self-conscious power the doom of bureaucracy will be sealed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>For no self-conscious community aware of its strength and separate life will consent to go on pulling chestnuts out of the fire for </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>Not in that direction lies any permanent hope of salvation for the absolute power of the bureaucracy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Perhaps the more thinking part of Anglo-India perceives this truth, hence the desire to find additional points of support and other principles of discord by which Indian Nationality can be hopelessly divided and cut to pieces in the making.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2114"><!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Of course the <i>Pioneer</i> does not avow the real object of this scheme for creating and perpetuating as political entities divisions which every healthful political organism progresses by subordinating and discharging of all political significance; but it is obvious enough.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>If it were possible for the bureaucracy to turn the social divisions of the community into political divisions, there could be no more fatal instrument of political disorganisation, and just as a natural indigenous rule finds its safety in better political organisation, so an unnatural alien rule finds its safety in disorganisation of what it preys upon.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>If it can, it destroys all centres of political organisation except itself; otherwise it tries to create unnatural centres whose action will hamper and distract the organic growth.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Caste with the proper safeguards is an admirable means of social organisation and conservation, but it has not and should not be allowed to have any political meaning.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>In India with the exception of Maharashtra it has had no political meaning at all.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>In the old times it was different.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>All the executive power and functions of war and politics were in the hands of the Kshatriyas for the good reasons that the whole work of war and protection of the country from internal and external disorder was assigned by society to them, and classes which did not give of their blood to preserve the peace and freedom of their country could not claim a direct control of administration.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>The Brahmin legislated, but legislation was then a religious function which implied no political power or position, and the people at large exercised only an indirect control by the pressure of a public opinion which no ruler could afford to neglect.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>Afterwards when Chandragupta and Asoka had created the tradition of a powerful absolutism </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 780</p>
<p class="PE"> with a strong bureaucratic organisation to support it, things changed, but not in the direction of a polity based on caste.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>On the contrary all classes, Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Sudra, could and did rise to any position of political power, even the throne itself, and except in Rajasthan where the Kshatriya ideals and institutions were preserved, caste came to count less rather than more in politics as time went on.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>All the great nation-builders have ignored caste as a political factor and it was only when the national spirit of the Mahrattas<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="607" href="#">3</a> declined after Panipat that a cleavage on the lines of caste took place which is still a slight danger to Nationalism in the South.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>It is curious to find the British rulers who have done their best to undermine caste as a social institution now dreaming of perpetuating and using it as a political instrument.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>We do not think they will make much by this move.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>The centripetal impulse in Hindu society is already too strong and with most of us political division by castes is too foreign to our habits of thought to take root.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The very idea of making a constituency of Bengal Kayasthas or Bengal Brahmins is absurd.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>Only where certain classes are much depressed and submerged a temporary strife may be created, but the onward sweep of the national movement, profoundly democratic as it is, will lift these classes to a nobler function in society and give them prizes which a Government post or title cannot hope to rival.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>If we listened to our Loyalists and continued to depend on alien favours and look on them as the crown of our political life, then indeed discord might be sown and castes learn to view themselves as distinct and hostile political interests, but against the force of the national movement such devices will array themselves in vain; its democratic and unifying spirit will make light of all such feeble attempts to divide.<!--/SENT--></p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm">About Unmistakable Terms</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2118"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We answered yesterday in general terms the claim advanced in the columns of the <i>Bengalee</i> to implicit and blind obedience from all Bengalis to the Calcutta Moderate leaders and to any local representatives of loyalty and moderation whom they may be pleased to erect to the gaze of an adoring public.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>But the <i>Bengalee</i>’s article contained also certain passages which demand more direct and plain-spoken answer<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="608" href="#">1</a> and this today we will give.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i>, not contented with its arrogant demand for submission, goes on to declare that the Nationalists, because they refuse this claim, are traitors to their country, that the men who opposed Mr. Chitnavis’ autocracy at Nagpur or Sir Pherozshah’s at Calcutta or Mr. K. B. Dutt’s at Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="609" href="#">2</a> are rowdies and the Nationalist leaders, Mr. Tilak and Mr. Khaparde in the West or<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="610" href="#">3</a> Srijuts Bipin<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="611" href="#">4</a> Pal, Aurobindo Ghose or Brahmabandhab Upadhyay in Calcutta have been abettors of rowdies, and it calls on the whole country to speak out in unmistakable terms against us.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>Unmistakable terms?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Well, then let us have an understanding about terms, to begin with.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>What is the definition of a traitor to his country?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>Are men traitors who have exposed themselves to persecution, imprisonment and harassment for the sake of their country?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Are those traitors who have made large sacrifices and devoted themselves to the cause of the Motherland?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>Or are those young men traitors who have stood in the forefront of the battle of boycott, braving the full fury of the bureaucrats and their police, and but for whom the boycott agitation would have flagged and perished after the first six months of excitement?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> says they are: for they may have done all these things, and yet if they oppose Mr. K. B. Dutt or Srijut Surendranath, they </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 782</p>
<p class="PE"> are traitors to their country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>On the other hand, have not those rather the complexion of traitors who are ready to call in police assistance against their countrymen in a Swadeshi conference although there has been no riot or violence, who boast that the police are in their hands and they can get all arrested who oppose them, who are ready to forget all the oppression from Barisal till now and call in Magistrates and police superintendents to the place of honour in national meetings, who are ready to take the <i>lathis</i> out of the hands of volunteers to please a District official?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>Or those, to take other examples, who wrote with brilliant success to Anglo-Indian papers to get Mr. Tilak prosecuted at the time of the Poona murders?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>Or those who pointed out Lala Lajpat Rai to the bureaucracy as the man to strike at when the Punjab was in a ferment over the Colonisation Bill?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But, by the <i>Bengalee</i>’s reasoning, men may be the moral descendants of Mir Jafar and Jagat Seth and yet be excellent patriots so long as they obey Moderate leaders and respect age and authority.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2119"><!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The second term we want to see so defined as to be unmistakable, is the term “leaders”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> calls for discipline and submission to leadership, but who are the leaders to whom we are to yield this unquestioning military obedience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>What is the qualification in Mr. K. B. Dutt of Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="612" href="#">5</a>, for instance, by virtue of which we are called upon to sacrifice for his sake our national self-respect, our convictions, and our natural right to a free exercise of our individual reason and conscience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The <i> Bengalee</i> talks of age, but it is preposterous to set up age by itself as the claim to leadership in politics; nor did the Moderate leaders themselves show an overwhelming deference to age when they were themselves younger and more ardent.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Respect for age as a part of social discipline we can understand, but leadership by seniority is a new doctrine.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Then again the <i>Bengalee</i> talks of authority.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>What authority?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>The authority of social position, wealth, professional success?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>Are we to obey Mr. K. B. Dutt because he is the leader of the Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="613" href="#">6</a> bar just as the East Bengal Mahomedans obey Salimullah because he is the Nawab of Dacca?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>We decline to accept any such law of obedience.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>Authority is always a delegated power which does not rest in </p>

<p class="PE"> the individual but proceeds to him from a definite source and returns to that source.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Official authority proceeds from an organised government executing the law which can both delegate its power to individuals and take them away again as it pleases.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>In popular movements the people are the only source from which authority can proceed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>The people follow a leader because he best interprets their ideas, aims and feelings or because he shows himself the best fitted to organize<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="614" href="#">7</a> and lead the popular forces to the realisation of popular aspirations and ideals, and the moment their confidence is shaken, the moment they begin to think he does not represent their best ideas and aspirations or that his methods of leadership are mistaken the authority begins to depart out of him.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>There can be no other kind of authority in democratic politics, nor can popular leadership be self-constituted.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Those who demand military obedience to self-constituted leaders are not preparing self-government but killing it, striking at its very roots.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>If what the Moderate leaders want is to replace bureaucracy not by popular self-government but by the government of particular persons or classes, if they want the movement to be not democratic but oligarchic or plutocratic, let them say so clearly, in God’s name, and let us have done with this juggling with words, and henceforward on both sides “speak in unmistakable terms”.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2120"><!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>Finally, while we are about defining terms, let us know when a man becomes President of a Conference or Congress session.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>The <i> Bengalee</i> says, “The attempt that was made to heckle the President and to bring into contempt his position as the head of the Conference was unique in the history of our Conferences and Congresses.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>We never witnessed in the whole course of our public life a proceeding . . . so derogatory to the authority of the President.”<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The “heckling” took place before Mr. K. B. Dutt was elected, when the President’s chair was vacant.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>Are we then to suppose that a man becomes President before he is elected?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>It is curious that Mr. K. B. Dutt himself made this unwarrantable claim when the trouble first began.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>By custom the Reception Committee designates a President but the decision of the Committee has no binding force on the delegates of the Conference </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 784</p>
<p class="PE"> who have always the power to elect anyone else whom they may prefer and not till a public confirmation by the votes of the delegates, has the President designated by the Reception Committee any authority or tenure of office.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>Until then he is merely a public man nominated for a particular function and the public have every right to “heckle” him so as to be sure that he will properly represent them before they give him their votes.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>Because till now this right has not been enforced, it does not follow that the public has forfeited its right, nor are we bound by “traditions” which mean simply the absence of lively popular interest and have no sanction in any reasonable principle of procedure.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2121"><!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>The <i>Bengalee</i> sets up discipline as the one requisite of a popular movement and to back up its proposition it is so ill-advised as to quote the example of Parnell and his solid Irish phalanx.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_42"><!-- --></a>The choice of this example shows a singular ignorance of English politics.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_43"><!-- --></a>Before Parnell’s advent, the Irish party in Parliament was a moderate party of Irish Liberals of very much the same nature as the old Congress party before the Boycott.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_44"><!-- --></a>It was balanced in Ireland by a revolutionary organisation using the most violent means employed by secret societies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_45"><!-- --></a>When Parnell first appeared on the scene, his first action was to revolt against the leader of the Irish party and make a party of his own.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_46"><!-- --></a>Consisting at first of a mere handful it soon captured the whole of Ireland and created the solid phalanx.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_47"><!-- --></a>But what was the secret of Parnell’s success?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_48"><!-- --></a>Parnell, unlike our Moderate leaders, did not dwarf the ideal of a national movement but always held the absolute independence of his country as the goal: he made it a fixed principle to accept no half-way house between independence and subjection short of an Irish Parliament with independent powers, he suffered no man to enter his party who did not pledge himself to refuse all office, honour or emolument from the alien government and he showed his people a better way of agitation than mere dependence on England on one side and secret outrage on the other,– the way of passive resistance, obstruction in Parliament and refusal of rent in the country.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_49"><!-- --></a>Only so could Parnell succeed in creating the solid phalanx, and when it was broken, it was by the folly of his adherents who receded </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 785</p>
<p class="PE"> from his principles and sacrificed their leader at the bidding of an English statesman.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_50"><!-- --></a>If Srijut Surendranath wishes to have the country solid behind him, he must be a Parnell first and not shrink from a Parnellite policy and ideals.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>We are willing to be corrected in any points of fact where we may have made a mistake, but the correspondent in question is either ill-informed or is ignoring facts.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2131"><!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>(1) He says that the Magistrate was not invited but came to the meeting apprehending a row.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>We ask, who gave the Magistrate the information that there was likelihood of a row?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>Who wrote the letter which the Magistrate declared to be Mr. K. B. Dutt’s and which was in Mr. K. B. Dutt’s handwriting?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>What was the object of the letter if not to invite the presence of the Magistrate and the police to overawe Mr. K. B. Dutt’s opponents?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>It is possible that none formally invited the officials.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>Why then were the volunteers informed that the Magistrate was coming and they must give up their lathis?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is entirely untrue that the “rowdiness of a section of the meeting nearly culminated in a disturbance,” in the sense of a resort to violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>There was plenty of shouting and confusion, but never any likelihood or the appearance of a likelihood of a resort to violence.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>The only violence was the assault on a delegate by the Moderates on the second day.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2132"><!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>(2) The statement about the bomb-incident, by which is apparently meant the attempt by unknown persons to wreck the Lieutenant-Governor’s special seems to have been an afterthought.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>The incident was not known in Midnapore till Sunday evening and not a word was breathed about it by Mr. K. B. Dutt as a reason for putting by the volunteers’ lathis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>It is not true that the Captain of Volunteers was sent for by the Magistrate and readily yielded.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The Captain was sent to the Magistrate, </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 789</p>
<p class="PE"> doubtless at the latter’s request, and made to resign because he could give no assurance about the lathis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>Not a single volunteer gave up his lathi, nor was there any prohibition of lathis in the Magistrate’s orders forbidding processions.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2133"><!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>(3) It matters little by what stages the enthronement of the Police Superintendent was prepared.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>The fact remains that he was given the central chair on the platform to which only a distinguished guest invited by the Committee or a visitor whom the whole country respects is entitled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>It is a fact that the President frequently turned to confer with him when there was disorder and on at least one occasion made use of his presence to threaten his opponents, declaring that he would see that law was enforced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>All this, it seems, was only common courtesy.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It may be so; we as “rowdies” cannot be expected to understand Moderate courtesy but it seems to us that such courtesy is an insult to the whole nation.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2134"><!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>(4) Mr. Dutt was certainly understood by many of the delegates to say that those who would not obey him as chairman (before he was elected President) might go out.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>It is possible that he may have been misunderstood or has forgotten it, and we do not care to press the point, as its only importance was an incident throwing light on his temper and attitude.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>As for the correspondent’s nonsense about discretion and valour, we did not know that it needed so much valour to leave the presence of K. B. Dutt, the Bold.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The delegates were restrained by other Nationalists from leaving the Pandal and it was certainly discretion to allow another chance to the President designate before taking the serious step of secession.<!--/SENT--></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2138"><!--SENT--><a name="s_1"><!-- --></a>We have now placed all the facts of the Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="616" href="#">1</a> Conference before the public and the reasons which made a Nationalist secession inevitable are sufficiently obvious.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_2"><!-- --></a>The Loyalist legend that the Nationalists came prepared to break up the Conference by force, but were either baffled, say some authorities, by the “mingled tact and firmness” of Mr. K. B. Dutt, or overawed, say others, by the presence of the President’s bureaucratic friends and allies, and in their rage and disappointment seceded and held a separate meeting, is too contemptible a lie to be treated seriously.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_3"><!-- --></a>“Why should they secede?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_4"><!-- --></a>What was the necessity of a second Conference?” ask our opponents with a holy simplicity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_5"><!-- --></a>“Did we not pass the same resolutions?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Was not a translation of the President’s marvellous address offered to the audience?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_7"><!-- --></a>What does it matter if the President broke his word?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>As for the interpretation of Swaraj as colonial self-government it is an unimportant matter, a prejudged matter; no Conference pretending to be a branch of the Congress organisation has any right to pass a resolution for Swaraj pure and simple and no responsible politician can support such a resolution.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>The Police Superintendent?<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>Well, he was there only to see that the train-wrecking outrage was not repeated by the Nationalists in the Conference Pandal!”<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2139"><!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Let us clear the matter of this jungle of irrelevancies.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>It was not over the resolutions passed by the Moderate Subjects Committee and Conference that the secession took place.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_13"><!-- --></a>When the Moderates saw that they had succeeded in disgusting and tiring out their opponents and had the field themselves they quietly adjourned to the Bailey Hall and held their own Committee and </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 791</p>
<p class="PE"> passed their own resolutions; – this is a favourite trick with this party which they perform in the full confidence that their opponents will in the end acquiesce in the accomplished fact for the sake of “unity”.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>We are informed that two resolutions were seriously modified in Committee at the command of the President, but whether these modifications stood or repentance came with the morning, does not matter: for the resolutions were not the cause of the secession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>The question of the language in which the President’s speech should be delivered was a detail on which the Mofussil delegates felt strongly and it is obvious that if these Conferences are to serve the purpose for which they are created, the vernacular must be the medium employed.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is absurd to have the President’s speech in English and then to patch up matters by offering a translation, when the audience is already wearied out by listening to a long address in a foreign tongue which they do not understand.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>If Mr. K. B. Dutt had to address all India, though no one asked him to, he could have delivered a lecture in the British Indian Association or published a pamphlet or written an article in the <i> Bengalee</i>; the Conference Pandal was not the place for his dissertation.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>But in any case the question of language was not a determining cause of the secession.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>Again we do not think it a light thing that a gentleman who fills the important and dignified position of the President of a District Conference, should, after he has been nominated without opposition on the strength of a clear promise, go back upon his word and yet cling to his post.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Honour is not a light thing, a public undertaking is not a light thing, and that the President did promise, has been testified to by honest Moderates as well as Nationalists who were present on the occasion.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>But the seceders did not take this ground for secession, for they had consented, on the strength of Srijut Surendranath’s qualified assurance, to the election which, once made, could not be unmade.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>As to Swaraj, we do not think it an unimportant matter, nor can we see that a District or Provincial Conference is debarred from passing a resolution in its favour; for by this rule several District Conferences, including the Bhola Conference, presided over by Srijut Ambikacharan<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="617" href="#">2</a> Majumdar<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="618" href="#">3</a>, have forfeited their right to be <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="2.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> considered branches of the Congress organization<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="619" href="#">4</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>But we will let that too go, for it was not to pass a resolution on unqualified Swaraj that a second Conference was held.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The secession took place because of the arbitrary conduct of the President supported by his party in evading the right of the whole body of delegates to express its opinion effectively on disputed matters and because of the use made by him of his alliance with the Police to support his arbitrary authority.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2140"><!--SENT--><a name="s_25"><!-- --></a>The emergence of two distinct parties in Indian politics has altered the whole nature of our political problems and our political activity and it is absolutely necessary that the constitution, methods and procedure of the Congress and the subordinate bodies should be constructed accordingly.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_26"><!-- --></a>Formerly it mattered nothing how the Congress was conducted, because there was no overt difference of opinion and whatever the Congress chiefs did or thought good was accepted without question or murmur.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>If there were dissentients they were easily silenced.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>But now there are two distinct parties with different ideals, different methods of work, a different spirit and standpoint, each struggling to get the ear of the country and the control of our public activities.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>It is clear that if these two parties are to live together in the Congress, there must be some procedure which both can recognise as just, some means of determining their relative strength and giving each a means of influencing the course of Congress work in proportion to its strength.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>This can be done by constituting the Subjects Committee so that each party shall be represented according to the strength it can muster or by allowing each section of the delegates to choose by vote its own representatives; the representatives of both sides can come to an agreement in Committee on disputed points and where agreement is impossible, the majority of votes will decide the matter, subject always to an inalienable right of appeal by amendment to the whole body of delegates.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_31"><!-- --></a>With such rules of procedure there would be no reason why two parties should not exist side by side and the deliberations of the Congress and Conferences be conducted with decorum, order and dignity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_32"><!-- --></a>But if one side refuses to acknowledge the </p>
<p class="pg-num">Page 793</p>
<p class="PE"> existence of the other, if it tries, when it cannot ignore it, to put it down by bullying or by the personal authority of its own leaders, and when even that is not possible by what it calls a combination of tact and firmness but the other side calls a mixture of trickery and arbitrariness, when it keeps procedure vague and disregards the rules common to all public assemblies, then to live together seems almost impossible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_33"><!-- --></a>This is the reason why the fight over the nomination of the President is so unnecessarily bitter.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_34"><!-- --></a>One side feels that it cannot allow the election of a Nationalist President because that would mean official recognition of the right of the other to share in influencing and guiding the Congress work.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_35"><!-- --></a>The other side feels that a Moderate President will simply be an instrument for Moderate tactics, not an impartial speaker of the House.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_36"><!-- --></a>He will rule Nationalist proposals and amendments out of order, refuse to take the sense of the House when called upon and by other arbitrary exercise of his authority serve his party.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_37"><!-- --></a>The rowdiness of which the Moderates complain is simply the clamorous persistence which is the sole means left to the other party to compel justice and a hearing.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_38"><!-- --></a>All this the Nationalists have again and again endured in the hope that by sheer persistence they might get their existence recognised and such rules formulated as would permit of differences being automatically settled.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_39"><!-- --></a>But when the Moderates<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="620" href="#">5</a> go<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="621" href="#">6</a> so far as to call in a third party is to<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="622" href="#">7</a> weigh down the balance in their<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="623" href="#">8</a> favour and that third party the common enemy, the bureaucrat and his police, the limit of sufferance is over-passed and nothing is left but to separate before difference of opinion degenerates into civil war.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_40"><!-- --></a>This was the stage which by the grace of Mr. K. B. Dutt was reached at Midnapore<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="624" href="#">9</a>.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_41"><!-- --></a>We bring no charge against the Calcutta leaders except that of supporting a man instead of considering the interests of the country; we prefer to believe that they had nothing to do with the underhand methods of their local lieutenant; but the support they rendered him made him impervious to reason and left the Nationalists no recourse<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="625" href="#">10</a> but secession.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_6"><!-- --></a>Nationalism depends for its success on the awakening and organizing<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="627" href="#">1</a> of the whole strength of the nation; it is therefore vitally important for Nationalism that the politically backward classes should be awakened and brought into the current of political life; the great mass of orthodox Hinduism which was hardly even touched by the old Congress movement, the great slumbering mass of Islam which has remained politically inert throughout the last century, the shopkeepers, the artisan class, the immense body of illiterate and ignorant peasantry, the submerged classes, </p>

<p class="PE"> even the wild tribes and races still outside the pale of Hindu civilisation, Nationalism can afford to neglect and omit none.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>It is not afraid of Pan-Islamism or of any<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="628" href="#">2</a> signs of the growth of a separate Mahomedan self-consciousness but rather welcomes them.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_9"><!-- --></a>It is not startled by the spectacle of a submerged class like the Namasudras demanding things which are, under existing circumstances, impracticable from Hindu society.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_10"><!-- --></a>When a community sues for separate rights from the bureaucracy, that is a sign not of life but of stagnant dependence which is death, but when it seeks a larger place in the national existence and it tries to feel its own existence and its own strength, it is a true sign of life, and what Nationalism asks is for life first and above all things; life, life and<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="629" href="#">3</a> still more life, is its cry.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_11"><!-- --></a>Let us by every means get rid of the pall of death which stifled us, let us dispel first the passivity, quiescence, the unspeakable oppression of inertia which has so long been our curse; that is the first and imperative need.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_12"><!-- --></a>As with backward communities, so with backward provinces.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We welcome any signs that the awakening has begun.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_16"><!-- --></a>It is for instance a cause of gratification that Orissa is beginning to feel its separate consciousness, and to attempt to grow into an organised life under a capable and high-spirited leader, although we consider his political attitude mistaken and believe that he is laying up for himself bitter disappointment and disillusionment in the future.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_17"><!-- --></a>But when the inevitable disappointment and disillusionment come, then will the new political consciousness, the new organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="631" href="#">5</a> life of Orissa become an immense addition of strength to the forces of Nationalism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_18"><!-- --></a>Yet it remains true that the only way these provinces can make up for lost time and bring themselves up swiftly to the level of the more advanced races, is by throwing themselves whole-heartedly into the full tide of Nationalism, and we do not know that we ought not to thank <span class="p_num"><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="9.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="7.gif"/><img align="right" border="0" hspace="0" src="e.gif"/></span> Sir Pherozshah for giving us a unique chance to light the fire in Gujerat.<!--/SENT--></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Bande Mataram - 2145"><!--SENT--><a name="s_19"><!-- --></a>The Gujeratis have only recently been touched by the tide of political life.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_20"><!-- --></a>Largely split up into Native States large and small and only partially under the direct rule of the bureaucracy, immersed in commerce and fairly prosperous until the last great famine swept over the once smiling and fertile province destroying life, human and animal, by the million they had slumbered politically while the rest of India was accustoming itself to some kind of political activity.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_21"><!-- --></a>It was at the Ahmedabad Congress that Gujerat was for the first time moved to a political enthusiasm, an awakening perhaps helped on by the association of a thoroughly Swadeshi Exhibition with the session of the Congress and the inclusion, however timid and half-hearted, of industrial revival in our political programme.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_22"><!-- --></a>Then came the outburst of the Swadeshi by which Gujerat, unlike some of the other politically backward provinces, was profoundly affected.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_23"><!-- --></a>The ground has been prepared and Nationalist sentiment has already spread among the educated Gujeratis.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_24"><!-- --></a>The Surat Congress provides an opportunity to give a fresh and victorious impulse which will make Gujerat Nationalism a powerful working and organized<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="632" href="#">6</a> force.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_27"><!-- --></a>The truth probably is that so far as the reproach has any foundation either in Bengal or Gujerat, the defect was due not so much to any constitutional cowardice as to indolence born of climate and a too fertile soil and to the prevalence of the peaceful and emotional religion of Chaitanya and Vallabhacharya.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_28"><!-- --></a>Be that as it may, Bengal under the awakening touch of Nationalism has wiped out that reproach for ever and there is no reason why Gujerat stirred by the same influences, awakened to the same energy, should not emulate her example and take like her a foremost place in the battle of Swaraj.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_29"><!-- --></a>We must not forget that she also has great traditions of old, traditions of learning, traditions of religion, traditions of courage and heroism.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_30"><!-- --></a>Gujerat was once part of the Rajput </p>

<!--SENT--><a name="s_8"><!-- --></a>The emergence of a new school of thought, their vigorous and menacing activity and enthusiasm have always made the votaries of established order uneasy and vindictive.<!--/SENT-->

<!--SENT--><a name="s_14"><!-- --></a>But while the Nationalists should pursue their line of action with unabated zeal they are also to consider, in view of the fierce and vindictive opposition which they have provoked not only from the bureaucracy but also a section of their own countrymen, whether they should not work in their own way without coming into collusion with those whose ideals and methods of work render any concerted action hardly possible.<!--/SENT-->
<!--SENT--><a name="s_15"><!-- --></a>We invite the Nationalists to Surat not so much to capture the Congress by violence, as our enemies maliciously put it, but to see that the Nationalist sentiment and Nationalist programme find their place in the deliberations and finally prevail.<!--/SENT-->
