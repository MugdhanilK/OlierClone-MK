<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 12"><em>"The path of later-on and the road of tomorrow lead only to the castle of nothing-at-all."</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 13">By the wayside, many-coloured flowers delight the eye, red berries gleam on small trees with knotty branches, and in the distance a brilliant sun shines gold upon the ripe corn.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 14">A young traveller is walking briskly along, happily breathing in the pure morning air; he seems joyful, without a care for the future. The way he is following comes to a cross-roads, where innumerable paths branch off in all directions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 15">Everywhere the young man can see criss-crossing footprints. The sun shines ever bright in the sky; the birds are singing in the trees; the day promises to be very beautiful. Without thinking, the traveller takes the path that is nearest to him, which seems, after all, quite practicable; it occurs to him for a moment that he could have chosen another way; but there will always be time to retrace his steps if the path he has taken leads nowhere. A voice seems to tell him, “Turn back, turn back, you are not on the right road.” But everything around him is charming and delightful. What should he do? He does not know. He goes on without taking any decision; he enjoys the pleasures of the moment. “In a little while,” he replies to the voice, “in a little while I shall think; I have plenty of time.” The wild grasses around him whisper in his ear, “Later.” Later, yes, later. Ah, how pleasant it is to breathe the scented breeze, while the sun warms the air with its fiery rays. Later, later. And the traveller walks on; the path widens. Voices are heard from afar, “Where are you going? Poor fool, don’t you see that you are heading for your ruin? You are young; come, come to us, to the beautiful, the good, the true; do not be misled by indolence</p>
<span id="page_4"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 4</p>
<p class="PE">and weakness; do not fall asleep in the present; come to the future.” “Later, later,” the traveller answers these unwelcome voices. The flowers smile at him and echo, “Later.” The path becomes wider and wider. The sun has reached its zenith; it is a glorious day. The path becomes a road.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 16">The road is white and dusty, bordered with slender birch-trees; the soft purling of a little stream is heard; but in vain he looks in every direction, he can see no end to this interminable road.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 17">The young man, feeling a secret unease, cries, “Where am I? Where am I going?... What does it matter? Why think, why act? Let us drift along on this endless road; let us walk on, I shall think tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 18">The small trees have disappeared; oak-trees line the road; a gully runs on either side. The traveller feels no weariness; he is borne along as if in a delirium.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 19">The gully becomes deeper; the oaks give way to fir-trees; the sun begins to go down. In a daze, the traveller looks all around him; he sees human figures rolling into the ravine, clutching at the fir-trees, the sheer rocks, the roots jutting from the ground. Some of them are making great efforts to climb out; but as they come near to the edge, they turn their heads and let themselves fall back.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 20">Hollow voices cry out to the traveller, “Flee this place; go back to the cross-roads; there is still time.” The young man hesitates, then replies, “Tomorrow.” He covers his face with his hands so as not to see the bodies rolling into the ravine, and runs along the road, drawn on by an irresistible urge to go forward. He no longer wonders whether he will find a way out. With furrowed brow and clothes in disorder, he runs on in desperation. At last, thinking himself far away from the accursed place, he opens his eyes: there are no more fir-trees; all around are barren stones and grey dust. The sun has disappeared beyond the horizon; night is coming on. The road has lost itself in an endless desert. The desperate traveller, worn out by his long run, wants</p>
<span id="page_5"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 5</p>
<p class="PE">to stop; but he must walk on. All around him is ruin; he hears stifled cries; his feet stumble on skeletons. In the distance, the thick mist takes on terrifying shapes; black forms loom up; something huge and misshapen suggests itself. The traveller flies rather than walks towards the goal he senses and which seems to flee from him; wild cries direct his steps; he brushes against phantoms.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 21">At last he sees before him a huge edifice, dark, desolate, gloomy, a castle to make one say with a shudder: “A haunted castle.” But the young man pays no attention to the bleakness of the place; these great black walls make no impression on him; as he stands on the dusty ground, he hardly trembles at the sight of these formidable towers; he thinks only that the goal is reached, he forgets his weariness and discouragement. As he approaches the castle, he brushes against a wall, and the wall crumbles; instantly everything collapses around him; towers, battlements, walls have vanished, sinking into dust which is added to the dust already covering the ground.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 22">Owls, crows and bats fly out in all directions, screeching and circling around the head of the poor traveller who, dazed, downcast, overwhelmed, stands rooted to the spot, unable to move; suddenly, horror of horrors, he sees rising up before him terrible phantoms who bear the names of Desolation, Despair, Disgust with life, and amidst the ruins he even glimpses Suicide, pallid and dismal above a bottomless gulf. All these malignant spirits surround him, clutch him, propel him towards the yawning chasm. The poor youth tries to resist this irresistible force, he wants to draw back, to flee, to tear himself away from all these invisible arms entwining and clasping him. But it is too late; he moves on towards the fatal abyss. He feels drawn, hypnotized by it. He calls out; no voice answers to his cries. He grasps at the phantoms, everything gives way beneath him. With haggard eyes he scans the void, he calls out, he implores; the macabre laughter of Evil rings out at last.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 23">The traveller is at the edge of the gulf. All his efforts have been in vain. After a supreme struggle he falls... from his bed.</p>
<span id="page_6"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 6</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 24">A young student had a long essay to prepare for the following morning. A little tired by his day’s work, he had said to himself as he arrived home, “I shall work later.” Soon afterwards he thought that if he went to bed early, he could get up early the next morning and quickly finish his task. “Let’s go to bed,” he said to himself, “I shall work better tomorrow; I shall sleep on it.” He did not know how truly he spoke. His sleep was troubled by the terrible nightmare we have described, and his fall awoke him with a start. Thinking over what he had dreamt, he exclaimed, “But it’s quite clear: the path is called the path of ‘later on’, the road is the road of ‘tomorrow’ and the great building the castle of ‘nothing at all’.” Elated at his cleverness, he set to work, vowing to himself that he would never put off until tomorrow what he could do today.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-virtues" style="font-style:italic">The Virtues</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 25">(<em>A tale for young and old</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 26">Once upon a time there was a splendid palace, in the heart of which lay a secret sanctuary, whose threshold no being had ever crossed. Furthermore, even its outermost galleries were almost inaccessible to mortals, for the palace stood on a very high cloud, and very few, in any age, could find the way to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 27">It was the palace of Truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 28">One day a festival was held there, not for men but for very different beings, gods and goddesses great and small, who on earth are honoured by the name of Virtues.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 29">The vestibule of the palace was a great hall, where the walls, the floor, the ceiling, luminous in themselves, were resplendent with a myriad glittering fires.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 30">It was the Hall of Intelligence. Near to the ground, the light was very soft and had a beautiful deep sapphire hue, but it became gradually clearer towards the ceiling, from which girandoles of diamonds hung like chandeliers, their myriad facets shooting dazzling rays.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 31">The Virtues came separately, but soon formed congenial groups, full of joy to find themselves for once at least together, for they are usually so widely scattered throughout the world and the worlds, so isolated amid so many alien beings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 32">Sincerity reigned over the festival. She was dressed in a transparent robe, like clear water, and held in her hand a cube of purest crystal, through which things can be seen as they really are, far different from what they usually seem, for there their image is reflected without distortion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 33">Near to her, like two faithful guardians, stood Humility, at</p>
<span id="page_8"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 8</p>
<p class="PE">once respectful and proud, and Courage, lofty-browed, clear-eyed, his lips firm and smiling, with a calm and resolute air.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 34">Close beside Courage, her hand in his, stood a woman, completely veiled, of whom nothing could be seen but her searching eyes, shining through her veils. It was Prudence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 35">Among them all, coming and going from one to another and yet seeming always to remain near to each one, Charity, at once vigilant and calm, active and yet discrete, left behind her as she passed through the groups a trail of soft white light. The light that she spreads and softens comes to her, through a radiance so subtle that it is invisible to most eyes, from her closest friend, her inseparable companion, her twin sister, Justice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 36">And around Charity thronged a shining escort, Kindness,</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 37">Patience, Gentleness, Solicitude, and many others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 38">All of them are there, or so at least they think.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 39">But then suddenly, at the golden threshold, a newcomer appears.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 40">With great reluctance the guards, set to watch the gates, have agreed to admit her. Never before had they seen her, and there was nothing in her appearance to impress them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 41">She was indeed very young and slight, and the white dress which she wore was very simple, almost poor. She takes a few steps forward with a shy, embarrassed air. Then, apparently ill at ease to find herself in such a large and brilliant company, she pauses, not knowing towards whom she should go.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 42">After a brief exchange with her companions, Prudence steps forward at their request and goes towards the stranger. Then, after clearing her throat, as people do when they are embarrassed, to give herself a moment to reflect, she turns to her and says:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 43">“We who are gathered here and who all know each other by our names and our merits are surprised at your coming, for you appear to be a stranger to us, or at least we do not seem to have ever seen you before. Would you be so kind as to tell us who you are?”</p>
<span id="page_9"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 9</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 44">Then the newcomer replied with a sigh: “Alas! I am not surprised that I appear to be a stranger in this palace, for I am so rarely invited anywhere.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 45">“My name is Gratitude.”</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="a-sapphire-tale" style="font-style:italic">A Sapphire Tale</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 46">Once upon a time, far away in the East, there was a small country that lived in order and harmony, where each one in his own place played the part for which he was made, for the greatest good of all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 47">Farmers, craftsmen, workmen and merchants — all had but one ambition, one concern: to do their work as best they could. This was in their own interest, firstly because, since each one had freely chosen his occupation, it suited his nature and gave him pleasure, and also because they knew that all good work was fairly rewarded, so that they, their wives and their children could lead a quiet and peaceful life, without useless luxury, but with a generous provision for their needs, which was enough to satisfy them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 48">The artists and scientists, few in number but each devoted to his science or art — his purpose in life — were supported by the grateful nation, which was the first to benefit from their useful discoveries and to enjoy their ennobling works. Thus sheltered from the cares of the struggle for life, these scientists had a single aim: that their experimental research, their sincere and earnest studies should serve to allay the sufferings of humanity, to increase its strength and well-being by making superstition and fear draw back as far as possible before the knowledge that brings solace and enlightenment. The artists, whose whole will was free to concentrate upon their art, had only one desire: to manifest beauty, each according to his own highest conception.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 49">Among them, as friends and guides, were four philosophers, whose entire life was spent in profound study and luminous contemplations, to widen constantly the field of human knowledge and one by one to lift the veils from what is still a mystery.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 50">All were content, for they knew no bitter rivalries and could each devote themselves to the occupation or the study that</p>
<span id="page_11"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 11</p>
<p class="PE">pleased him. Since they were happy they had no need for many laws, and their Code was only this: a very simple counsel to all, “Be yourself”, and for all a single law to be strictly observed, the law of Charity, whose highest part is Justice, the charity which will permit no wastage and which will hinder no one in his free evolution. In this way, very naturally, everyone works at once for himself and for the collectivity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 51">This orderly and harmonious country was ruled by a king who was king simply because he was the most intelligent and wise, because he alone was capable of fulfilling the needs of all, he alone was both enlightened enough to follow and even to guide the philosophers in their loftiest speculations, and practical enough to watch over the organisation and well-being of his people, whose needs were well known to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 52">At the time when our narrative begins, this remarkable ruler had reached a great age — he was more than two hundred years old — and although he still retained all his lucidity and was still full of energy and vigour, he was beginning to think of retirement, a little weary of the heavy responsibilities which he had borne for so many years. He called his young son Meotha to him. The prince was a young man of many and varied accomplishments. He was more handsome than men usually are, his charity was of such perfect equity that it achieved justice, his intelligence shone like a sun and his wisdom was beyond compare; for he had spent part of his youth among workmen and craftsmen to learn by personal experience the needs and requirements of their life, and he had spent the rest of his time alone, or with one of the philosophers as his tutor, in seclusion in the square tower of the palace, in study or contemplative repose.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 53">Meotha bowed respectfully before his father, who seated him at his side and spoke to him in these words:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 54">“My son, I have ruled this country for more than a hundred and seventy years and although, to this day, all men of goodwill have seemed content with my guidance, I fear that my great age will soon no longer allow me to bear so lightly the heavy</p>
<span id="page_12"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 12</p>
<p class="PE">responsibility of maintaining order and watching over the wellbeing of all. My son, you are my hope and my joy. Nature has been very generous to you; she has showered you with her gifts and by a wise and model education you have developed them most satisfactorily. The whole nation, from the humblest peasant to our great philosophers, has a complete and affectionate trust in you; you have been able to win their affection by your kindness and their respect by your justice. It is therefore quite natural that their choice should fall on you when I ask for leave to enjoy a well-earned repose. But as you know, according to age-old custom, no one may ascend the throne who is not biune, that is, unless he is united by the bonds of integral affinity with the one who can bring him the peace of equilibrium by a perfect match of tastes and abilities. It was to remind you of this custom that I called you here, and to ask you whether you have met the young woman who is both worthy and willing to unite her life with yours, according to our wish.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 55">“It would be a joy to me, my father, to be able to tell you, ‘I have found the one whom my whole being awaits’, but, alas, this is yet to be. The most refined maidens in the kingdom are all known to me, and for several of them I feel a sincere liking and a genuine admiration, but not one of them has awakened in me the love which can be the only rightful bond, and I think I can say without being mistaken that in return none of them has conceived a love for me. Since you are so kind as to value my judgment, I will tell you what is in my mind. It seems to me that I should be better fitted to rule our little nation if I were acquainted with the laws and customs of other countries; I wish therefore to travel the world for a year, to observe and to learn. I ask you, my father, to allow me to make this journey, and who knows? — I may return with my life’s companion, the one for whom I can be all happiness and all protection.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 56">“Your wish is wise, my son. Go — and your father’s blessing be with you.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 58">Amid the western ocean lies a little island valued for its valuable forests.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 59">One radiant summer’s day, a young girl is walking slowly in the shade of the wonderful trees. Her name is Liane and she is fair among women; her lithe body sways gracefully beneath light garments, her face, whose delicate skin seems paler for her carmine lips, is crowned with a heavy coil of hair so golden that it shines; and her eyes, like two deep doors opening on limitless blue, light up her features with their intellectual radiance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 60">Liane is an orphan, alone in life, but her great beauty and rare intelligence have attracted much passionate desire and sincere love. But in a dream she has seen a man, a man who seems, from his garments, to come from a distant land; and the sweet and serious gaze of the stranger has won the heart of the girl — now she can love no other. Since then she has been waiting and hoping; it is to be free to dream of the handsome face seen in the night that she is walking amid the solitude of the lofty woods.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 61">The dazzling sunlight cannot pierce the thick foliage; the silence is hardly broken by the light rustle of the moss beneath the footsteps of the walking girl; all sleeps in the heavy drowse of the noonday heat; and yet she feels a vague unease, as if invisible beings were hiding in the thickets, watchful eyes peeping from behind trees.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 62">Suddenly a bird’s song rings out clear and joyful; all uneasiness vanishes. Liane knows that the forest is friendly — if there are beings in the trees, they cannot wish her harm. She is seized by an emotion of great sweetness, all appears beautiful and good to her, and tears come to her eyes. Never has her hope been so ardent at the thought of the beloved stranger; it seems to her that the trees quivering in the breeze, the moss rustling beneath her feet, the bird renewing its melody — all speak to her of the One whom she awaits. At the idea that perhaps she is going to meet him she stops short, trembling, pressing her hands against her beating heart, her eyes closed to savour to the full the exquisite emotion; and now the sensation grows more and more intense</p>
<span id="page_14"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 14</p>
<p class="PE">until it is so precise that Liane opens her eyes, sure of a presence. Oh, wonder of wonders! He is there, he, he in truth as she has seen him in her dream... more handsome than men usually are. — It was Meotha.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 63">With a look they have recognised each other; with a look they have told each other of the long waiting and the supreme joy of rediscovery; for they have known each other in a distant past, now they are sure of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 64">She places her hand in the hand he offers her, and together, silent in a silence filled with thoughts exchanged, they wend their way through the forest. Before them appears the sea, calm and green beneath a happy sun. A great ship sways gently near the shore.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 65">Meekly, trustingly, Liane follows Meotha into the boat which awaits them, drawn up on the sand. Two strong oarsmen put it to sea and soon bring them alongside the vessel.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 66">Only as she sees the little island disappearing below the horizon does the girl say to her companion:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 67">“I was waiting for you, and now that you have come, I have followed you without question. We are made for each other. I feel it, I know it, and I know also that now and forever you will be my happiness and my protection. But I loved my island birthplace with its beautiful forests, and I would like to know to what shore you are taking me.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 68">“I have sought you throughout the world, and now that I have found you, I have taken your hand without asking you anything, for in your eyes I saw that you expected me. From this moment and forever, my beloved shall be all to me; and if I have made her leave her little wooded isle, it is to lead her as a queen to her kingdom, the only land on earth that is in harmony, the only nation that is worthy of Her.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 69">It was in January 1907, shortly after the sanguinary crushing of the revolutionary movement in Russia. A few friends and I had assembled in a small group for philosophical studies, when we were informed of the presence of a mysterious visitor asking to be admitted.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 70">We went out to meet him, and in the anteroom we saw a man whose clean but very worn clothes, arms held close to his sides, pale face steadfastly turned towards the ground and half-concealed by a black felt hat, made him look like a hunted animal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 71">At our approach he removed his hat and looked up to cast us a brief, frank glance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 72">In the half-light of the hall one could scarcely distinguish the features of his waxen face; only its sorrowful expression was clearly visible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 73">The silence had become embarrassing, and to break it, I asked, “Can I help you, Sir?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 74">“I have just come from Kiev to see you.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 75">His voice was tired, deep, a little hollow, with a slight Slavonic accent.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 76">From Kiev to see us! This was something indeed. We were surprised. He thought our silence indicated doubt, and after some hesitation he added in a lower tone, “Yes, in Kiev there is a group of students who are deeply interested in great philosophical ideas. Your books have fallen into our hands, and we were happy to find at last a synthetical teaching which does not limit itself to theory, but encourages action. So my comrades, my friends, told me, ‘Go and seek their advice on what is preoccupying us.’ And I have come.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 77">It was clearly expressed, in correct if not elegant language, and we immediately knew that if, perhaps out of caution, he</p>
<span id="page_16"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 16</p>
<p class="PE">was withholding something from us, what he was telling us at least was the truth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 78">Once we had brought him in and made him sit down in the drawing-room, we saw him in full light. Oh, the poor face pallid with long vigil or seclusion far from air and sun, ravaged by suffering, lined by anxiety, and yet all shining with a fine intellectual light which haloed his brow and lit his eyes, sad, wan eyes reddened by overwork or perhaps by tears....</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 124">Since we want to learn to think better in order to live better, since we want to know how to think in order to recover our place and status in life as feminine counterparts and to become in fact the helpful, inspiring and balancing elements that we are potentially, it seems indispensable to me that we should first of all enquire into what thought is.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 125">Thought.... It is a very vast subject, the vastest of all, perhaps.... Therefore I do not intend to tell you exactly and completely what it is. But by a process of analysis, we shall try to form as precise an idea of it as it is possible for us to do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 126">It seems to me that we must first of all distinguish two very different kinds, or I might say qualities, of thought: thoughts in us which are the result, the fruit, as it were, of our sensations, and thoughts which, like living beings, come to us — from where?... most often we do not know — thoughts that we perceive mentally before they express themselves in our outer being as sensations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 127">If you have observed yourselves even a little, you must have noticed that the contact with what is not yourselves is established first of all through the medium of your senses: sight, hearing, touch, smell, etc. The impact felt in this way, whether slight or violent, pleasant or unpleasant, arouses a feeling in you — like or dislike, attraction or repulsion — which very quickly turns into an idea, an opinion you form about the object, whatever it may be, that has determined the contact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 128">An example: you go out and as you step out of your house you see that it is raining and at the same time you feel the damp cold seizing you; the sensation is unpleasant, you feel a dislike for the rain and inwardly, almost mechanically, you say to yourself,</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 129">“This rain is really a nuisance, especially as I have to go out! Not to mention that I am going to get dreadfully dirty; Paris is very dirty in rainy weather, especially now that all the streets have been dug up” (and so on)....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 130">All these and many other similar thoughts about the simple fact that it is raining come to assail your mind; and if nothing else, outwardly or inwardly, comes to attract your attention, for a long while, almost without your noticing it, your brain may produce minute, trivial thoughts about this small, insignificant sensation....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 131">This is how most human lives are spent; this is what human beings most often call <em>thinking</em>─a mental activity that is almost mechanical, unreflecting, out of our control, a reflex. All thoughts concerning material life and its many needs are of the same quality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 132">Here we face the first difficulty to be overcome; if we want to be able to truly think, that is, to receive, formulate and form valid and viable thoughts, we must first of all empty our brain of all this vague and unruly mental agitation. And this is certainly not the easiest part of our task. We are dominated by this irrational cerebral activity, we do not dominate it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 133">Only one method is worth recommending: meditation. But as I was telling you last time, there are many ways of meditating; some are very effective, others less so.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 134">Each one should find his own by successive trial and error.

But this result can only be achieved gradually, after much reflection in a spirit of complete impartiality. I would like to make a short digression here to put you on your guard against a frequent confusion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 138">I have just said that we always look upon ourselves with great indulgence, and I think in fact that our defects very often appear to us to be full of charm and that we justify all our weaknesses. But to tell the truth, this is because we lack self-confidence. Does this surprise you?... Yes, I repeat, we lack confidence, not in what we are at the present moment, not in our ephemeral and ever-changing outer being — this being always finds favour in our eyes — but we lack confidence in what we can become through effort, we have no faith in the integral and profound transformation which will be the work of our true self, of the eternal, the divine who is in all beings, if we surrender like children to its supremely luminous and far-seeing guidance.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="on-dreams" style="font-style:italic">On Dreams</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 202">At first sight one might think that the subject of dreams is an altogether secondary one; this activity generally seems to have very little importance compared to the activity of our waking state.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 203">However, if we examine the question a little more closely, we shall see that this is not at all the case.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 204">To begin with, we should remember that more than one third of our existence is spent in sleeping and that, consequently, the time devoted to physical sleep well deserves our attention.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 205">I say physical sleep, for it would be wrong to think that our whole being sleeps when our bodies are asleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 206">A study based on certain experiments conducted according to the strictest scientific methods, was published some twenty years ago by Dr. Vaschid in a book entitled “Sleep and Dreams”.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 207">The doctors who carried out these experiments were led to the conclusion that mental activity never really ceases; and it is this activity which is more or less confusedly transcribed in our brains by what we know as dreams. Thus, whether we are aware of it or not, we always dream.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 208">Certainly, it is possible to suppress this activity completely and to have a total, dreamless sleep; but to be able in this way to immerse our mental being in a repose similar to the repose of our physical being, we must have achieved a perfect control over it, and this is not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 209">In most cases, this activity is even heightened, because, as the body is asleep, the internal faculties are no longer focussed on or used by the physical life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 210">It is sometimes said that in a man’s sleep his true nature is revealed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 211">Indeed, it often happens that the sensory being, which throughout the whole day has been subjected to the control of</p>
<span id="page_35"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 35</p>
<p class="PE">the active will, reacts all the more violently during the night when this constraint is no longer effective.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 212">All the desires that have been repressed without being dissolved — and this dissociation can only be obtained after much sound and wide-ranging analysis — seek satisfaction while the will is dormant.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 213">And since desires are true dynamic centres of formation, they tend to organise, within and around us, the combination of circumstances that is most favourable to their satisfaction.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 214">In this way the fruit of many efforts made by our conscious thought during the day can be destroyed in a few hours at night.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 215">This is one of the main causes of the resistances which our will for progress often encounters within us, of the difficulties which sometimes appear insurmountable to us and which we are unable to explain, because our goodwill seems so integral to us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 216">We must therefore learn to know our dreams, and first of all to distinguish between them, for they are very varied in nature and quality. In the course of one night we may often have several dreams which belong to different categories, depending on the depth of our sleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 217">As a general rule, each individual has a period of the night that is more favourable for dreams, during which his activity is more fertile, more intellectual, and the mental circumstances of the environment in which he moves are more interesting.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 218">The great majority of dreams have no other value than that of a purely mechanical and uncontrolled activity of the physical brain, in which certain cells continue to function during sleep as generators of sensory images and impressions conforming to the pictures received from outside.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 219">These dreams are nearly always caused by purely physical circumstances — state of health, digestion, position in bed, etc.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 220">With a little self-observation and a few precautions, it is easy to avoid this type of dream, which is as useless as it is tiring, by eliminating its physical causes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 221">There are also other dreams which are nothing but futile</p>
<span id="page_36"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 36</p>
<p class="PE">manifestations of the erratic activities of certain mental faculties, which associate ideas, conversations and memories that come together at random.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 222">Such dreams are already more significant, for these erratic activities reveal to us the confusion that prevails in our mental being as soon as it is no longer subject to the control of our will, and show us that this being is still not organised or ordered within us, that it is not mature enough to have an autonomous life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 223">Almost the same in form to these, but more important in their consequences, are the dreams which I mentioned just now, those which arise from the inner being seeking revenge when it is freed for a moment from the constraint that we impose upon it. These dreams often enable us to perceive tendencies, inclinations, impulses, desires of which we were not conscious so long as our will to realise our ideal kept them concealed in some obscure recess of our being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 224">You will easily understand that rather than letting them live on unknown to us, it is better to bring them boldly and courageously to the light, so as to force them to leave us for ever.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 225">We should therefore observe our dreams attentively; they are often useful instructors who can give us a powerful help on our way towards self-conquest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 226">No one knows himself well who does not know the unconfined activities of his nights, and no man can call himself his own master unless he has the perfect consciousness and mastery of the numerous actions he performs during his physical sleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 227">But dreams are not merely the malignant informers of our weaknesses or the malicious destroyers of our daily effort for progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 228">Although there are dreams which we should contend with or transform, there are others which should on the contrary be cultivated as precious auxiliaries in our work within and around us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 229">There can be no doubt that from many points of view our subconscient knows more than our habitual consciousness.</p>
<span id="page_37"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 37</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 230">Who has not had the experience of a metaphysical, moral or practical problem with which we grapple in vain in the evening, and whose solution, impossible to find then, appears clearly and accurately in the morning on waking?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 231">The mental enquiry had been going on throughout the period of sleep and the internal faculties, freed from all material activity, were able to concentrate solely on the subject of their interest.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 232">Very often, the work itself remains unconscious; only the result is perceived.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 233">But at other times, by means of a dream, we participate in all the mental activity in its smallest details. Only the cerebral transcription of this activity is often so childish that we normally pay no attention to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 234">From this point of view, it is interesting to note that there is nearly always a considerable disparity between what our mental activity is in fact and the way in which we perceive it, and especially the way in which we remain conscious of it. In its own medium, this activity produces vibrations which are transmitted by repercussion to the cellular system of our organic brain, but in our sleeping brain, the subtle vibrations of the suprasensible domain can affect only a very limited number of cells; the inertia of most of the organic supports of the cerebral phenomenon reduces the number of active elements, impoverishes the mental synthesis and makes it unfit to transcribe the activity of the internal states, except into images which are most often vague and inadequate.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 235">To make this disparity more tangible to you, I shall give you an example, one among many, which has come to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 236">Recently, a writer was preoccupied with a half-written chapter which he was unable to finish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 237">His mind, particularly interested in this work of composition, continued the chapter during the night, and the more it phrased and rephrased the ideas making up the various</p>
<span id="page_38"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 38</p>
<p class="PE">paragraphs, it became aware that these ideas were not expressed in the most rational order and that the paragraphs had to be rearranged.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 238">All this work was transcribed in the consciousness of our writer in the following dream: he was in his study with several armchairs which he had just brought there and was arranging and rearranging them in the room, until he found the most suitable place for each one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 239">In the knowledge that certain people may have had of such inadequate transcriptions, we can find the origin of the popular beliefs, the “dream-books” which are the delight of so many simple souls.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 240">But it is easy to understand that this clumsy transcription has a particular form for each individual; each one makes his own distortion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 241">Consequently, an excessive generalisation of certain interpretations which may have been quite correct for the person applying them to his own case, merely gives rise to vulgar and foolish superstitions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 242">It is as if the writer we have just mentioned were to impart as a great secret to his friends and acquaintances that every time they saw themselves arranging armchairs in a dream, it was a sign that the next day they would at some moment reverse the order of the paragraphs in a book.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 243">The cerebral transcription of the activities of the night is sometimes warped to such an extent that phenomena are perceived as the opposite of what they really are.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 244">For example, when you have a bad thought against someone and when this bad thought, left to itself, gathers full force during the night, you dream that the person in question is beating you, is doing you some bad turn, or even wounding you or trying to kill you.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 245">Moreover, as a general rule, we should take great intellectual precautions before interpreting a dream, and above all, we should review exhaustively all the subjective explanations before</p>
<span id="page_39"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 39</p>
<p class="PE">we assign to it the value of an objective reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 246">However, especially in those who have unlearnt the habit of always directing their thoughts towards themselves, there are cases where we can observe events outside ourselves, events which are not the reflection of our personal mental constructions. And if we know how to translate into intellectual language the more or less inadequate images into which the brain has translated these events, we can learn many things that our too limited physical faculties do not allow us to perceive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 247">Some people, by a special culture and training, are even able to become and remain conscious of the deeper activities of their inner being, independently of their own cerebral transcription, and thus to evoke them and know them in the waking state with the full range of their faculties.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 248">Many interesting observations could be made on this topic, but perhaps it is better to allow each one to experience for himself the many possibilities which lie within man’s reach in a field of activity which he too often leaves undeveloped.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 249">Uncultivated lands produce weeds. We do not want any weeds in ourselves, so let us cultivate the vast field of our nights.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 250">You must not think that this can be in the least harmful to the depth of your sleep and the efficacy of a repose which is not only indispensable but beneficial. On the contrary, there are many people whose nights are more tiring than their days, for reasons which often elude them; they should become conscious of these reasons so that their will can begin to act on them and remove their effects, that is, to put a stop to these activities which in such cases are nearly always useless and even harmful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 251">If our night has enabled us to gain some new knowledge — the solution of a problem, a contact of our inner being with some centre of life or light, or even the accomplishment of some useful task — we shall always wake up with a feeling of strength and well-being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 252">The hours that are wasted in doing nothing good or useful are the most tiring.</p>
<span id="page_40"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 40</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 253">But how can we cultivate this field of action, how can we become conscious of our nocturnal activities?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 254">We shall find the way to do so very broadly outlined in a passage from a book devoted to the study of our inner life:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 255">“The same discipline of concentration which enables man not to remain a stranger to the inner activities of the waking state also provides him with a way to escape from his ignorance of the even richer activities of the various states of sleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 256">“These activities usually leave behind them only a few rare and confused memories.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 257">“However, it is noteworthy that a chance circumstance, an impression received, a word pronounced, is sometimes enough to bring suddenly back to the consciousness a whole long dream of which we had no recollection a moment before.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 258">“We can infer from this simple fact that the conscious activity has taken only a very minor part in the phenomena of the sleeping state, since in the normal state of things they would have remained lost for ever in the subconscient memory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 259">“In this domain, the practice of concentration should therefore focus both on the special faculty of memory and on the participation of the consciousness in the activities of the sleeping state.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 260">“Someone who wishes to recover the memory of a forgotten dream should first of all focus his attention on the vague impressions which the dream may have left behind it and in this way follow its indistinct trace as far as possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 261">“This regular exercise will enable him to go further every day towards the obscure retreat of the subconscient where these forgotten phenomena of sleep take refuge, and thus trace out an easily followed path between these two domains of consciousness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 262">“One useful remark to be made from this point of view is that the absence of memories is very often due to the abruptness of the return to the waking consciousness. (The waking should not be too abrupt.)</p>
<span id="page_41"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 41</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 263">“As a matter of fact, at that moment, the new activities breaking into the field of consciousness force out everything that is unfamiliar to them and add to the difficulty of the subsequent work of concentration needed to recall the things which have been expelled in this way. On the other hand, this work will be made easier whenever certain mental and even physical precautions are observed for a quiet transition from one state to another. (If possible, do not make any abrupt movements in bed at the time of waking.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 264">“However, this special training of the faculty of memory can only transform into conscious phenomena in the waking state the phenomena which have already been made conscious, even if only fleetingly, during sleep. For where there is no consciousness, there can be no memory.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 265">“Consequently, in the second place, we must work to extend the participation of the consciousness to a greater number of activities in the sleeping state.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 266">“The daily habit of reviewing with interest the various dreams of the night, whose traces will gradually become transformed into precise memories, as well as the habit of noting them down on waking, will be found most helpful from this point of view.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 267">“By these habits, the mental faculties will be led to adapt their mechanism to phenomena of this kind and to exercise on them their attention, their curiosity and power of analysis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 268">“A kind of intellectualisation of our dreams will then occur, with the double result of making the conscious activities intervene more and more closely in the play of the formerly disorganised activities of the sleeping state, and of progressively increasing their scope by making them more and more rational and instructive.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 269">“Dreams will then take on the nature of precise visions and sometimes of revelations, and useful knowledge of a whole important order of things will be gained.”</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="the-supreme-discovery" style="font-style:italic">The Supreme Discovery</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 270">If we want to progress integrally, we must build within our conscious being a strong and pure mental synthesis which can serve us as a protection against temptations from outside, as a landmark to prevent us from going astray, as a beacon to light our way across the moving ocean of life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 271">Each individual should build up this mental synthesis according to his own tendencies and affinities and aspirations. But if we want it to be truly living and luminous, it must be centred on the idea that is the intellectual representation symbolising That which is at the centre of our being, That which is our life and our light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 272">This idea, expressed in sublime words, has been taught in various forms by all the great Instructors in all lands and all ages.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 273">The Self of each one and the great universal Self are one. Since all that is exists from all eternity in its essence and principle, why make a distinction between the being and its origin, between ourselves and what we place at the beginning?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 274">The ancient traditions rightly said:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 275">“Our origin and ourselves, our God and ourselves are one.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 276">And this oneness should not be understood merely as a more or less close and intimate relationship of union, but as a true identity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 277">Thus, when a man who seeks the Divine attempts to reascend by degrees towards the inaccessible, he forgets that all his knowledge and all his intuition cannot take him one step forward in this infinite; neither does he know that what he wants to attain, what he believes to be so far from him, is within him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 278">For how could he know anything of the origin until he becomes conscious of this origin in himself?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 279">It is by understanding himself, by learning to know himself,</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 43</p>
<p class="PE">that he can make the supreme discovery and cry out in wonder like the patriarch in the Bible, “The house of God is here and I knew it not.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 280">That is why we must express that sublime thought, creatrix of the material worlds, and make known to all the word that fills the heavens and the earth, “I am in all things and all beings.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 281">When all shall know this, the promised day of great trans-figurations will be at hand. When in each atom of Matter men shall recognise the indwelling thought of God, when in each living creature they shall perceive some hint of a gesture of God, when each man can see God in his brother, then dawn will break, dispelling the darkness, the falsehood, the ignorance, the error and suffering that weigh upon all Nature. For, “all Nature suffers and laments as she awaits the revelation of the Sons of God.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 282">This indeed is the central thought epitomising all others, the thought which should be ever present to our remembrance as the sun that illumines all life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 283">That is why I remind you of it today. For if we follow our path bearing this thought in our hearts like the rarest jewel, the most precious treasure, if we allow it to do its work of illumination and transfiguration within us, we shall know that it lives in the centre of all beings and all things, and in it we shall feel the marvellous oneness of the universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 284">Then we shall understand the vanity and childishness of our meagre satisfactions, our foolish quarrels, our petty passions, our blind indignations. We shall see the dissolution of our little faults, the crumbling of the last entrenchments of our limited personality and our obtuse egoism. We shall feel ourselves being swept along by this sublime current of true spirituality which will deliver us from our narrow limits and bounds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 285">The individual Self and the universal Self are one; in every world, in every being, in every thing, in every atom is the Divine Presence, and man’s mission is to manifest it.</p>

<p class="Q"><em>What is the most useful work to be done at the present moment?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 316">The general aim to be attained is the advent of a progressing universal harmony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 317">The means for attaining this aim, in regard to the earth, is the realisation of human unity through the awakening in all and the manifestation by all of the inner Divinity which is One.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 318">In other words, — to create unity by founding the Kingdom of God which is within us all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 319">This, therefore, is the most useful work to be done:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 320">(1) For each individually, to be conscious in himself of the Divine Presence and to identify himself with it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 321">(2) To individualise the states of being that were never till now conscious in man and, by that, to put the earth in connection with one or more of the fountains of universal force that are still sealed to it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 322">(3) To speak again to the world the eternal word under a new form adapted to its present mentality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 323">It will be the synthesis of all human knowledge.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 324">(4) Collectively, to establish an ideal society in a propitious spot for the flowering of the new race, the race of the Sons of God.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 325" style="text-align:center">*<br/>* *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 326">The terrestrial transformation and harmonisation canbe brought about by two processes which, though opposite in appearance, must combine — must act upon each other and complete each other:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 327">(1) Individual transformation, an inner development leading to the union with the Divine Presence.</p>
<span id="page_51"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 51</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 328">(2) Social transformation, the establishment of an environment favourable to the flowering and growth of the individual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 329">Since the environment reacts upon the individual and, on the other hand, the value of the environment depends upon the value of the individual, the two works should proceed side by side. But this can be done only through division of labour, and that necessitates the formation of a group, hierarchised, if possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 330">The action of the members of the group should be threefold: (1) To realise in oneself the ideal to be attained: to become a perfect earthly representative of the first manifestation of the Unthinkable in all its modes, attributes and qualities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 331">(2) To preach this ideal by word, but, above all, by example, so as to find out all those who are ready to realise it in their turn and to become also announcers of liberation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 332">(3) To found a typic society or reorganise those that already exist.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 333" style="text-align:center">*<br/>* *</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 334">For each individual also there is a twofold labour to be done, simultaneously, each side of it helping and completing the other:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 335">(1) An inner development, a progressive union with the Divine Light, sole condition in which man can be always in harmony with the great stream of universal life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 336">(2) An external action which everyone has to choose according to his capacities and personal preferences. He must find his own place, the place which he alone can occupy in the general concert, and he must give himself entirely to it, not forgetting that he is playing only one note in the terrestrial symphony and yet his note is indispensable to the harmony of the whole, and its value depends upon its justness.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What is my place in the universal work?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 337">We all have a role to fulfil, a work to accomplish, a place which we alone can occupy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 338">But since this work is the expression, the outer manifestation of the inmost depth of our being, we can become conscious of its definitive form only when we become conscious of this depth within ourselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 339">This is what sometimes happens in cases of true conversion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 340">The moment we perceive the transfiguring light and give ourselves to it without reserve, we can suddenly and precisely become aware of what we are made for, of the purpose of our existence on earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 341">But this enlightenment is exceptional. It is brought about within us by a whole series of efforts and inner attitudes. And one of the essential conditions if we want to achieve and maintain within ourselves these attitudes, these soul-states, is to devote part of our time each day to some impersonal action; every day, we must do something useful for others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 342">Until we know <em>the</em> essential thing we are intended to do, we must therefore find a temporary occupation which will be the best possible manifestation of our present capacities and our goodwill.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 343">Then we shall give ourselves to this occupation with conscientiousness and perseverance, knowing that it may well be only a stage and that with the progress of our ideal and our energies, we shall certainly one day be led to see more clearly the work we must accomplish. To the extent that we lose the habit of referring everything to ourselves and learn more and more to give ourselves more completely, with greater love, to earth and</p>
<span id="page_53"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 53</p>
<p class="PE">men, we shall see our horizons widen and our duties become more numerous and clear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 344">We shall find that our action follows a general line of progression determined by our own particular temperament.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 345">Indeed, the successive occupations we shall hold before we become conscious of the definitive form of our action will always point in the same direction, be of the same type and mode, which is the spontaneous expression of our character, our nature, our own characteristic vibration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 346">The discovery of this tendency, this particular orientation, should come about quite naturally; it is a matter of taste and free choice, beyond all outer selfish considerations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 347">People are often blamed for choosing an action for themselves which does not correspond to their abilities. There is a slight confusion here.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 348">Those who freely set out to accomplish their own favourite work cannot, in my opinion, be on the wrong track; this work must surely be the expression of their own particular tendency. But their mistake lies in wanting to accomplish this work all at once in its entirety, in its integrality, in depth and above all on the surface, forgetting that the very conception of the work is imperfect as they are imperfect and that to be wise, they should add to the knowledge of what they <em>wish</em> to do the more immediate and practical knowledge of what they are <em>capable</em> of doing at the present moment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 349">By taking both these factors into account, they can employ themselves with a minimum waste of time and energy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 350">But few people act with so much insight and wisdom. And it very often happens that one who is seeking his way falls into one of these two possible errors:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 351">Either he takes his desires for realities, that is, he overestimates his present strength and capacity and imagines that he is capable of immediately assuming a place and a role which he can honourably fulfil only after many years of methodical and persevering effort.</p>
<span id="page_54"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 54</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 352">Or he underestimates his latent powers and deliberately con-fines himself, in spite of his deeper aspirations, to a task which is far beneath his abilities and which will gradually extinguish within him the light that could have shone for others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 353">It seems difficult at first to steer clear of these pitfalls and find the balanced way, the middle way.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 354">But we have a sure pointer to guide us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 355">Above all, whatever we undertake should not be done for the purpose of self-assertion. If we are attached to fame and glory, to the esteem of our peers, we are soon led to make concessions to them; and if we seek any opportunity to admire ourselves, it becomes easy to make ourselves out to be what we are not, and nothing more obscures the ideal within us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 356">We should never tell ourselves, openly or indirectly, “I want to be great, what vocation can I find for myself in order to become great?”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 357">On the contrary, we should tell ourselves, “There must certainly be something I can do better than anyone else, since each one of us is a special mode of manifestation of the divine power which, in its essence, is one in all. However humble and modest it may be, this is precisely the thing to which I should devote myself, and in order to find it, I shall observe and analyse my tastes, tendencies and preferences, and I shall do it without pride or excessive humility, whatever others may think I shall do it just as I breathe, just as the flower smells sweet, quite simply, quite naturally, because I cannot do otherwise.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 358">As soon as we have abolished within us, even for a moment, all egoistic desires, all personal and selfish aims, we can surrender to this inner spontaneity, this deep inspiration which will enable us to commune with the living and progressive forces of the universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 359">The conception of our work will inevitably grow more perfect as we grow more perfect ourselves; and to realise this growing perfection, no effort to exceed ourselves should be</p>
<span id="page_55"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 55</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What is the greatest obstacle in ourselves to our consecration to impersonal work?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 360">Regarded from the most general point of view, this obstacle is indistinguishable from the very reason for the work to be accomplished: it is the present state of imperfection of physical Matter.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 361">Since we are made up of an imperfect substance, we cannot but share in this imperfection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 362">Therefore, whatever degree of perfection, consciousness or knowledge is possible to our inmost being, the very fact that it incarnates in a physical body gives rise to obstacles to the purity of its manifestation; and on the other hand, the aim of its incarnation is victory over these obstacles, the transformation of Matter. We must therefore not be surprised or saddened if we encounter obstacles within ourselves, for every single being on earth has difficulties to overcome.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 363">The cause of this imperfection may become apparent to us from two points of view, one general, the other individual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 364">From the general point of view, the imperfection of Matter comes from its lack of receptivity to the more subtle forces which are to be manifested through it. But this lack of receptivity itself has many causes, and to explain them would lead us too far away from the heart of our subject. Besides, I think that, in the last analysis, all difficulties lie in the illusion of personality, that is, the illusion that one thing can be distinct from the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 365">To avoid speculating on the necessity of this illusion for the very existence of the universe as we know it, I shall consider the question solely from the terrestrial and human angle.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 366">This illusion of a self separate from the whole brings about two tendencies within ourselves.</p>
<span id="page_57"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 57</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 367">The first comes from an unconscious need for identification with the whole. But by the very fact of the illusion of personality, each one conceives this identification only as an absorption into himself and seeks more or less to be the centre of this whole. As a result, in proportion to his intellectual or physical strength, each one attempts to draw to himself everything he is conscious of in order to continually increase his personality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 368">This is the outcome of a desire which is justified in essence — to become conscious of everything — but ignorant in expression, for if a way to become conscious of everything does exist, it certainly does not lie in trying to draw everything to oneself, which is absurd and unrealisable, but in identifying one’s consciousness with the consciousness of the whole, which demands the very opposite action and attitude.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 369">The second tendency, which is in fact a normal consequence of the first, is an excessively conservative spirit, a fixity of the whole nature — intellectual, moral and physical — which makes it impossible for us to transform ourselves as rapidly as we should in order to be always in harmony with the law of universal progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 370">It is as if the individual were afraid of not being different enough from others if he encouraged too free and large an exchange with the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 371">Moreover, this fixity comes from the desire to appropriate and the error of believing that we can own something in the universe. We think that the elements we are made of are our own. Consciously or unconsciously, we want to hold on to them for ourselves while at the same time we are quite ready to add to them by drawing other elements to ourselves; but we forget that since there is no real separation, we can receive nothing if we do not give.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 372">We must be a link in the chain: the link does not grow bigger at the expense of its neighbours. But when it faithfully transmits the current it has received, it will receive another, and the more complete and swift its transmission, the more it will</p>
<span id="page_58"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 58</p>
<p class="PE">be brought into contact with a great number of forces or things for it to use or manifest. And so, little by little, by taking and keeping nothing for itself, it can become aware of everything by communing with everything.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 373">Foreseeing the objections which could be raised, I shall add this:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 374">When I speak of the illusion of personality, I am not denying that each one has a special mode of manifestation. Differentiation does not mean division.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 375">Why should there be so many countless links in the chain if each one did not have its own function?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 376">And here another comparison is needed to complete the first, for any comparison is necessarily incomplete.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 377">If we consider ourselves as cells of an immense living organism, we shall immediately understand that a cell, which is dependent for its own life on the life of the whole and can separate itself from it only at the risk of destruction, does in fact have its own special part to play in the whole.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 378">But this role is precisely what is most profoundly spontaneous in our being; no egoistic assertion of our personality is needed to discover it. On the contrary, the more fully we give ourselves to an impersonal action, the more this role will gain in strength and clarity within us. But this role is precisely what constitutes our true individuality, since it is our own special way of manifesting the Divine Essence, which is one in everything and in all.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 379">In each one of us there is a difficulty which is more central than all the others; it is the one which, relative to the part we have to play in the world, is like the shadow of that light, a shadow which gradually dissolves, fades more and more as the light becomes more intense, more brilliant, more powerful and extends to the whole being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 382">Some people have an excessive sensitivity, which becomes most acute when it does not manifest itself outwardly. This sensitivity is of an affective, emotional kind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 383">It usually comes from a supra-nervous substance which is highly intellectualised but not spiritualised enough for its degree of intellectualisation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 384">It is a stage of evolution in which the being is ready for self-giving, for he is conscious of himself; but, as a result of the work of individualisation, of intellectualisation he has undergone, he has acquired the habit of considering everything in relation to himself and has carried the illusion of personality to its utmost limit.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 385">Thus it is sometimes very difficult for him not to watch himself acting, feeling and thinking, and this results in a lack of spontaneity which verges on insincerity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 386">The being takes pleasure in his extreme sensitivity; he is</p>
<span id="page_60"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 60</p>
<p class="PE">a delicate instrument which responds marvellously to the least vibration, and so, instead of exteriorising himself and forgetting his own self as he should, he withdraws into himself, observes and analyses and almost contemplates himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 387">Thus cultivated, the emotional sensitivity goes on increasing, sharpening and refining itself. And since in life opportunities for suffering are more frequent than opportunities for joy, the need to experience and study these subtle movements of feeling develops an inclination, a taste for suffering, a true mystical aberration which is nothing but self-seeking through suffering, a refined but very pernicious form of egoism.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 388">The practical results of this need to suffer are altogether disastrous if you add to it the intuitive but still inaccurate perception that the work you have to accomplish, your purpose in life, is to draw towards yourself, to take upon yourself, the suffering of others and change it into harmony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 389">As a matter of fact, on one hand this knowledge is incomplete because you do not know that the only way to relieve others, to eliminate a little suffering in this world, is not to allow any sensitivity, however painful it may seem, to arouse suffering in yourself or to disturb your peace and serenity. On the other hand the idea of the work to be accomplished is itself warped by the illusion of personality. The correct idea is not to draw all suffering to yourself, which is unrealisable, but to identify yourself with all suffering, in all others, to become in it and in them a seed of light and love which will give birth to a deep understanding, to hope, trust and peace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 390">Until this is well understood, the taste for sacrifice rises in the being; and each time an opportunity for it appears, since you are not <em>disinterested</em> in this matter, since you <em>desire</em> this sacrifice, it becomes something sentimental and irrational and results in absurd errors which sometimes have disastrous consequences. Even if you are in the habit of reflecting before acting, the reflections preceding the act will necessarily be biased, since they are warped by the taste for suffering, by the</p>
<span id="page_61"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 61</p>
<p class="PE">desire to have an opportunity to impose a painful sacrifice on yourself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 391">Thus, consciously or not, instead of sacrificing yourself for the good of others, you sacrifice yourself for the pleasure of it, which is perfectly absurd and of no benefit to anyone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 392">No action should be deemed good, no action should be undertaken until we know its immediate and, if possible, its distant consequences, and until it appears that they must in the end add, however little, to earthly happiness. But to be able to give a sound judgment on the matter, this judgment must in no way be disturbed by any personal preference, and this implies self-detachment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 393">Not the detachment which is equivalent to the annihilation of the capacity to feel, but the detachment which brings about the abolition of the capacity to suffer.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 394">By this you should understand that for the time being I am excluding insensitive people, those who do not suffer because the substance they are made of is still too unrefined, too crude to feel, those who are not even ready for suffering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 395">But of those who have achieved a high development of sensitivity, it can be said that their capacity to suffer is the exact measure of their imperfection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 396">Indeed, the expression of a true psychic life in the being is peace, a joyful serenity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 397">Any suffering is therefore a precious indication to us of our weak point, of the point which demands a greater spiritual effort from us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 398">Thus, to cure in ourselves this attraction for suffering, we must understand the absurdity, the petty egoism of the various causes of our sufferings.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 399">And to cure our excessive and ridiculous desire for sacrifice — too frequently for its own sake, regardless of any useful results — we must understand that if we are to remain in contact with all human sufferings through our sensitivity, we must also be vigilant and discerning enough to dissolve these</p>
<span id="page_62"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 62</p>
<p class="PE">sufferings as they come; to the clear-sighted, they are purely imaginary.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 400">For, from this point of view, the only way to come to the help of men is to oppose to their suffering an immutable and smiling serenity which will be the highest human expression of Impersonal Love.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 401">Finally, in a case such as the one I have just shown to you, even more than in any other, it is indispensable to keep in mind that true impersonality does not consist only in forgetting ourselves in our acts, but above all in the fact of not being aware that we are forgetting ourselves.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 402">In short, to be truly impersonal, we must stop noticing that we are being impersonal.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 403">And then the work can be accomplished with a large-hearted spontaneity, in all its perfection.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What improvements can we bring to our meetings?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 404">We said one day with regard to the numerous groups that form and disappear almost immediately, that this phenomenon of rapid decay is a result of the conventional and arbitrary factors which enter into the organisation of these groups.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 405">In fact, they are founded upon an ideal prototype originating from one or several minds — a formula which is sometimes very beautiful in theory, but which takes no account of the individuals who with their difficulties and weaknesses must form the living cells of the group.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 406">In my opinion, it is impossible to give an arbitrary form to any being, individual or collective; its form can only be the outer expression which perfectly reflects the quality of its constituent elements.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 407">Because this vital law of formation is not observed, these groups follow one upon another and multiply endlessly; all are fated to the same swift destruction. For instead of being living organisms capable of normal growth, development and expansion, they are nothing but inert conglomerations without any possibility of progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 408">We had decided to heed this law and carefully refrain from prematurely deciding upon the conditions of life of our little group. It is not yet born, it has hardly begun its period of gestation. Let us allow it to form and blossom very slowly before making any rules for its existence.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 409">Consequently, it would seem disastrous to me to attempt to organise our meetings according to a preconceived plan or to conform to the ideal of one individual or another or even of all of us. We would then be entering on the way of artificial formations shaped by theory and destined to perish even more</p>
<span id="page_64"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 64</p>
<p class="PE">rapidly than those institutions which develop according to their own spontaneity, which is the sum total of the varied tendencies of their members.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 410">Certainly, our meetings should progress, since that is the condition of their continuation. But this can only happen if they become an opportunity for each one of us to progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 411">For if we want their progress to be sincere and in depth, it must depend on our own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 412">If we could all bring with us here an ardent aspiration for greater knowledge and wisdom, we would create a contemplative atmosphere, which I would like to be able to call religious, and this atmosphere would be most favourable to our self-perfection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 413">An atmosphere of spirituality is sometimes a far greater help than an exchange of words; the most beautiful thoughts cannot make us progress unless we have a persistent will to translate them within ourselves into higher feelings, more exact sensations and nobler actions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 414">Thus, to improve our meetings, the essential condition is our own self-improvement.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 415">If we unify ourselves and identify our consciousness with the consciousness of our Divine Self, our group will become unified. If we enlighten and illumine our intellectual faculties, our group will manifest the light. If we allow impersonal love to permeate our whole being, our group will radiate love. And finally, if we bring order into ourselves, our group will become organised of itself, without our needing to intervene arbitrarily in its formation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 416">In short, let us become the living cells of the organism we want to bring forth, and let us not forget that on the value of its cells will depend the value of the collective being and its action, its usefulness in the work of universal harmony.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 417"><em>First condition</em>. To understand the full importance of this mastery by becoming aware, through observation, that our actions are the exact expression of our thoughts and that so long as we do not have perfect control over our mental activity, these thoughts are nothing but reflexes coming from every outside influence (sensations and suggestions).

To seek in ourselves the idea which seems to be the highest, the noblest, the purest and most disinterested and, until the day we find a more beautiful idea to replace it, to make it the pivot around which our mental synthesis will be built up, the regulating idea in whose light all other thoughts can be seen and judged, that is, accepted or rejected.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 421"><em>Fifth condition</em>. To undergo a regular daily mental discipline.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 425" style="font-style:italic">The Power of Words</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 426">It seems unnecessary to draw your attention to the quantity of useless words that are uttered each day; this evil is well known to all, although very few people think of remedying it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 427">But there are many other words which are spoken needlessly. That is to say, in the course of the day, we often have the opportunity of expressing a helpful wish by pronouncing one word or another, provided that we know how to put the appropriate thought behind the words.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 428">But too often we lose this opportunity of drawing a beneficial mental atmosphere around the people we know and thus of truly helping them. It would be very useful to remedy this neglect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 429">To do this, we must refuse to allow our minds to remain in that state of vague and passive imprecision which is almost constant in most people.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 430">To cure ourselves progressively of this somnolence, we can, when pronouncing a word, force ourselves to reflect upon its exact meaning, its true import, in order to make it fully effective.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 431">In this regard, we can say that the active power of words comes from three different causes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 432">The first two lie in the word itself, which has become a battery of forces. The third lies in the fact of living integrally the deep thought expressed by the word when we pronounce it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 433">Naturally, if these three causes of effectiveness are combined, the power of the word is considerably enhanced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 434">1) There are certain words whose resonance in the physical world is the perfect vibratory materialisation of the more subtle vibration produced by the thought in its own domain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 435">If we examine closely this similarity between the vibrations of thought and sound, we can discover the limited number</p>
<span id="page_68"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 68</p>
<p class="PE">of root syllables which express the most general ideas, and which are to be found in most spoken languages with an almost identical meaning. (This origin of language should not be confused with the origin of written languages, which are of an altogether different nature and correspond to different needs.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 436">2) There are other words which have been repeated in certain circumstances for hundreds of years and which are instinct with the mental forces of all those who have pronounced them. They are true batteries of energy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 437">3) Finally, there are words which assume an immediate value when they are pronounced, as a result of the living thought of the one who pronounces them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 438">To illustrate what I have just said with an example, here is a very powerful word, for it can combine the qualities of all three categories: it is the Sanskrit word “AUM”.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 439">It is used in India to express the divine Immanence. There, it is associated with every meditation, every contemplation, every yogic practice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 440">More than any other sound, this sound “AUM” gives rise to a feeling of peace, of serenity, of eternity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 441">Moreover, this word is instinct with the mental forces which for centuries all those who have used it have accumulated around the idea that it expresses; and, for Hindus especially, it has the true power of bringing one into contact with the divine Essence it evokes.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 442">And as Orientals have a religious mind and the habit of concentration, few pronounce this word without putting into it the conviction that is needed to make it fully effective.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 443">In China, a similar effect is obtained with a word of identical meaning and somewhat similar sound, the word “TAO”.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 444">Our western languages are less expressive; in their present form, they are too far removed from the root language which gave birth to them. But we can always animate a word by the power of our living and active thought.</p>
<span id="page_69"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 69</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 445">Besides, there are formulas which we could profitably add to all those in common use.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 446">These formulas were used in certain ancient schools of initiation. They served as greetings, and in the mouth of one who knew how to think them, they had a very special power of action.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 447">The disciples, the neophytes who were taking their first steps on the path, were greeted: “May the peace of equilibrium be with you.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 448">All those who by their constant and progressive inner and outer attitude had shown their deep and lasting goodwill, were greeted: “May the highest good be yours.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 449">And in certain instructors manifesting especially high forces, this word was endowed with the power of transmitting true gifts, for example, the gift of healing.</p>

<p class="Q"><em>What is the most useful idea to spread and what is the best example to set?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 450">The question can be considered in two ways, a very general one applicable to the whole earth, and another specific one which concerns our present social environment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 451">From the general point of view, it seems to me that the most useful idea to spread is twofold:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 452">1) Man carries within himself perfect power, perfect wisdom and perfect knowledge, and if he wants to possess them, he must discover them in the depth of his being, by introspection and concentration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 453">2) These divine qualities are identical at the centre, at the heart of all beings; this implies the essential unity of all, and all the consequences of solidarity and fraternity that follow from it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 454">The best example to give would be the unalloyed serenity and immutably peaceful happiness which belong to one who knows how to live integrally this thought of the One God in all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 455">From the point of view of our present environment, here is the idea which, it seems to me, it is most useful to spread:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 456">True progressive evolution, an evolution which can lead man to his rightful happiness, does not lie in any external means, material improvement or social change. Only a deep and inner process of individual self-perfection can make for real progress and completely transform the present state of things, and change suffering and misery into a serene and lasting contentment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 457">Consequently, the best example is one that shows the first stage of individual self-perfection which makes possible all the rest, the first victory to be won over the egoistic personality: disinterestedness.</p>
<span id="page_71"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 71</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 458">At a time when all rush upon money as the means to satisfy their innumerable cravings, one who remains indifferent to wealth and acts, not for the sake of gain, but solely to follow a disinterested ideal, is probably setting the example which is most useful at present.</p>

<p class="Q"><em>Which minds are nearest to me and what is my ideal work among them?</em></p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 459">Always, in one way or another, life puts in our path those who for some reason are near to us. Each individual creates his own environment according to what he is himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 460">And, if such is our dominant preoccupation, all those whom we thus meet on our way are the very ones to whom we can be most useful.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 461">For one who lives constantly in the spiritual consciousness, everything that happens to him takes on a special value and all is conducive to his progressive evolution. It will always be beneficial for him to observe his encounters, to investigate both the apparent and the deeper reasons for them, and, in accordance with his altruistic aspirations, he will ask himself what good he can do in each different case. And according to his own degree of spirituality, his action will always have a greater or lesser spiritualising effect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 462">If we observe at all attentively the causes which bring us closer to our kind, we see that these contacts occur at various levels of depth in our being, depending on our own special mode of conscious activity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 463">We can classify these relationships into four main categories corresponding to our four principal modes of activity: physical, vital, psychic and mental. They may have their play in one or several of these categories, simultaneously or successively, according to the quality and type of the manifestation of our activity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 464">Physical contact is compulsory, so to say, since it depends on the fact that we have a physical body. It inevitably occurs with those who have provided us with this body and with all</p>
<span id="page_73"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 73</p>
<p class="PE">those who are materially dependent on them. These are the relations of kinship. There are also relationships of proximity: neighbourhood in houses, in the various means of transport, in the street. (I may remark here — and this remark also applies to the other three categories — that this relationship is not necessarily exclusive: this is in fact rare, since we are seldom active on only one plane of our being; what I mean is that the physical relationship is dominant over the other three.)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 465">Vital contact occurs between impulses and desires which are identical or liable to combine in order to complement and heighten one another.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 466">Psychic contact occurs between converging spiritual aspirations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 467">Mental contact comes from similar or complementary mental capacities and affinities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 468">Normally, if the predominance of one category is not clearly established — and this can only happen when there is enough order in our being to organise it in all its depth and complexity — we can and should give material help to those who are near to us for physical reasons.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 469">With certain exceptions, material help is the best assistance we can give to the members of our family or to those whom we chance to meet in the street, in trains, in ships, in buses, etc.: pecuniary help, aid in case of illness or danger.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 470">We should assist the sensitivity of those who are attracted to us because they have identical tastes, artistic or otherwise, by rectifying, balancing or canalising their sense-energies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 471">We can help those who by a common aspiration for progress have been brought into contact with us, through our example, by showing them the path, and through our love, by smoothing the way for them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 472">Finally, we must allow the light of our intelligence to shine for those who come close to us as a result of mental affinity, so that, if possible, we may widen their field of thought and enlighten their ideal.</p>
<span id="page_74"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 74</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 473">These various affinities express themselves outwardly in slight and sometimes subtle variations in the conditions of our encounters, and because our insight is seldom alert enough, these slight variations often elude us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 474">But to direct our action in the right way and reduce as far as possible the causes of our wrong attitudes towards our fellowmen, we should always investigate with the greatest care the numerous reasons for our contacts and find the category of affinities which binds us to them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 475">A few rare beings are close to us in all four modes of existence at the same time. These are friends in the deepest sense of the word. It is on them that our actions can have their most integral, their most perfectly helpful and beneficial effect.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 476">We should never forget that the duration of a contact between two human lives depends on the number and depth of the states of being in which the affinities that bind them have their play.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 477">Only those who commune with the eternal essence within themselves and in all things can be eternally united.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 478">Only those are friends forever who have been close or distant friends from all time in this or other worlds.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 479">And whether or not we meet these friends depends on the encounter we must first experience within ourselves, in the unknown depths of our being.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 480">Moreover, when this meeting occurs, our whole attitude is transformed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 481">When we become one with the inner Godhead, we become one in depth with all, and it is through Her and by Her that we must come into contact with all beings. Then, free from all attraction and repulsion, all likes and dislikes, we are close to what is close to Her and far from what is far from Her.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 482">Thus we learn that in the midst of others we should become always more and more a divine example of integral activity both intellectual and spiritual, an opportunity which is offered to them to understand and enter upon the path of divine life.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 486">Mlle. Molitor has very kindly asked me to say a few words on thought. Since you have been good enough to come and listen to me today, I conclude that you are among those who, knowing the primary importance of thought, its master-role in life, strive to build up for themselves an ever stronger and more conscious thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 487">So I hope you will excuse me if, while showing you what this primary importance of thought is, I venture to give you—to give <em>us</em>—some advice on learning how to think well.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 488">In this, I shall act only as an interpreter for you on behalf of the great instructors, the great initiates who have come from age to age to bring to men their words of wisdom and peace.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 489">But before translating for you as best I can their beautiful teachings on the rational, effective and just use of the marvellous faculty in us which is thought, it seems to me indispensable that we should first of all enquire a little into what thought is.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 490">You probably remember that, last month, we made two observations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 491">The first is that thought is a living, active, autonomous entity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 492">The second is that in order to contend victoriously with the injurious effects of the polluted mental atmosphere in which we live, we must build up within ourselves a pure, luminous and powerful intellectual synthesis.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 493">For this purpose we must bring down into ourselves the highest thoughts within our reach, that is, within the field of our mental activity, and make them our own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 494">But since thoughts are living beings, they have, as we do, their likes and dislikes, their attractions and repulsions.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 495">We must therefore adopt a special attitude towards them, treat them as people, make advances and concessions to them and show them the same attentions as we would to someone we would wish to be our friend.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 496">On this matter, a modern philosopher writes:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 497">“Sometimes thinkers in their meditations, explorers and prospectors of the intellectual world in their discoveries, and poets — the diviners of thought — in their dreams, feel and vaguely sense that the idea is not something abstract and bodiless. It appears to them to be winged, something which soars, comes close and flees, denies and gives itself, something which must be called, pursued and won.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 498">“To the most clairvoyant, the idea seems to be an aloof person with her whims and desires, her preferences, her queenly disdain, her virgin modesty. They know that it takes much care to win her and but a little thing to lose her, that there is a love of the mind for the idea, a love made of consecration and sacrifice, and without this the idea cannot belong to it.</p>
<span id="page_79"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 79</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 499">“But these are pretty symbols, and few indeed can perceive the very precise reality which lies beneath them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 500">“It needed a Plato to identify this thing which lives and vibrates, which moves and shines, travels and is propagated through time and space, which acts and wills and freely chooses its own time and place — in short, to know the Idea as a being.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 501">Let us take especially one phrase from this beautiful page: “There is a love of the mind for the idea, a love made of consecration and sacrifice, and without this the idea cannot belong to it.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 502">This is not an image. To enter into an intimate and conscious relation with the idea, we must consecrate ourselves to it, love it with a disinterested love, in itself, for itself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 503">Today we shall try to find out what this love consists of and, at the same time, what we must do for it to blossom within us. The first attitude to be taken, the most indispensable, is the most perfect mental sincerity it is within our power to acquire. Of all sincerities, this is perhaps the most difficult. Not to deceive oneself mentally is not an easy thing to achieve.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 504">First of all we have, as I explained to you last December, a certain habit of thought which comes from the education we have received, from the influence of the environment, and which is most often made up of social conventions and collective suggestions. This habit naturally makes us give a far better reception to all the thoughts which are similar, if not conformable, to those which already fill our minds, than to those which could, to however small an extent, unsettle this mental structure.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 505">For the same reason, as you probably remember, it is sometimes so difficult for us to learn to think for ourselves: we hesitate to change anything whatsoever in our customary way of thinking, which is most often made up of social conventions and collective suggestions. For our whole existence is based upon this habit. It takes a great courage and a great love of progress to consent to examine one’s existence in the light of thoughts that are deeper, and consequently more independent of the customs and usages of the environment.</p>
<span id="page_80"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 80</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 506">You can judge from this the great, the very great love of the idea that is needed to achieve such a revolution in one’s habits, for the sole purpose of gaining the power to enter into a more intimate, more conscious relationship with it!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 507">And even when our mental synthesis is made up of thoughts that we have received and made our own in the course of a constant and persevering effort of meditation, we must love the idea with a very powerful love, perhaps even more powerful still, so that we may always be in quest of a new idea, ready to give it the most eager reception if it is willing to come to us. For we are well aware that each new idea will constrain us to modify our synthesis, relegate to the background ideas which had seemed to us master-ideas, bring to the light other ideas too long disregarded, rearrange them all so that they do not clash, to the great detriment of our brain, in brief, a long and sometimes painful task. Indeed we are very seldom disinterested with regard to ideas; there are some which we prefer to others and which, consequently, occupy a place in our mental activity which they do not always deserve.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 508">And if we must replace them with others that are more precise, more true, we often hesitate long before doing so, we cling to them as indispensable friends, and we love their defects as well as their qualities, — which is the worst way to love people, as well as the laziest and most selfish, — for we are always more highly esteemed by those we flatter than by those from whom we demand a constant effort of progress. But our difficulties do not stop there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 509">As a consequence of the intellectual education we have received or of some personal preference, we are also prejudiced about the way, or ways, in which ideas should be introduced to us.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 510">These preconceptions are so many veritable superstitions that we must overcome.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 511">They are different for each person.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 512">Some people have the superstition of the book. For an idea</p>
<span id="page_81"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 81</p>
<p class="PE">to merit consideration in their eyes, it must have been expressed in some famous book, in one of the bibles of humanity, and any thought coming in any other way will appear suspect to them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 513">There are some who accept an idea only from the official sciences, and those who recognise one only in the established religions, old or new. For others, the idea must come from the mouth of a man of renown with enough honorary titles so that none can question his value.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 514">Still others, more sentimental, in order to come into contact with thought, need a master who should be the perfect incarnation of the ideal human standard constructed by their imagination. But they are bound to be sorely disappointed, for they forget that they alone are capable of realising their own ideal, that the one in whom they have placed their confidence has a duty to realise his own ideal which, consequently, however great it may be, may very well differ considerably from their own. So, most often, when they become aware of these divergences, since they had attached themselves to the ideas only for the sake of the man, they will reject both man and ideas together.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 515">This is absurd, for ideas are worth what they are worth regardless of the individuals who have expressed them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 516">Finally, there is a whole category of people enamoured of the miraculous, who will recognise a truth only if it has come to them clothed in the mystery of a supramundane revelation, in dream or trance.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 517">For them the master must be their God, an angel or a Mahatma, and give them his precious teachings during their contemplation or their sleep.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 518">Needless to say, this method is still more unreliable than the others. That a thought should reach us by extraordinary means is no guarantee of its correctness or its truth.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="81-1" href="#">1</a></p>

                  I do not mean that it is impossible to come into contact with an idea by these means, but they are far from being the only ones or even perhaps the best.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 520">You see, the true lover of the idea knows that by seeking it ardently he will find it everywhere, and even more so in the subterranean and secret fountainheads than in those which have lost their pristine purity by turning into rivers that are majestic and renowned but also polluted by the waste of all kinds which they carry with them.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 521">The lover of the idea knows that it can come to him from the mouth of a child as from the mouth of a learned man.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 522">And it is even in this unexpected way that it can reach him most often.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 523">That is why it is said: “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings comes forth truth.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 524">For if the thought of a child cannot have the precision of the thought of a man, neither does it have the fixity which results from laziness of habit and which in the adult prevents the thought from expressing itself whenever it does not belong to the categories which are familiar to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 525">Moreover, it was to escape the distortion of an environment made up of habit and fixity that the schools of ancient times where the young prophets were educated were established far from the cities.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 526">That is also why the great instructors of men began their apprenticeship in solitude. For if too many things are absent for the thought to be able to express itself in the minds of unrefined men, too many things are also absent from the mind of the cultivated man shaped by the artificial life of human societies.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 527">How much silence is needed — not the outer, illusory and momentary silence, but on the contrary the true, profound, integral, permanent silence — to be able to hear the far-off voices of thought!</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 528">That is why the sincere lover of knowledge also knows that the greatest sages are always the most modest and the most unknown. For one who has the knowledge and the capacity prefers silence and retirement where he is free to accomplish his</p>

<p class="PE">work without being disturbed by anything, to the fanfares of glory which would throw him as fodder to men.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 529">The lover of thought knows that he will find thought everywhere around him, in the little flower as in the radiant sun; nothing and no one appears to him too humble or too obscure to be for him an intermediary of the idea he is ever seeking.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 530">But above all he knows that the best, the most reliable contact with the idea is certainly a direct contact.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 531">Since we are made out of the universal substance, we are this universe in miniature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 532">Since no phenomenon can exist without a corresponding medium, the existence of ideas implies the existence of a corresponding domain, the realm of free intelligence always in form but not subject to form, and this realm is within us as within the great universe.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 533">If then we concentrate sufficiently, if we become conscious of our inmost being, we shall come into contact, within it and through it, with the free universal intelligence, the world of ideas.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 534">Then, if we have taken care to polish our mirror well and to clear it of all the dust of preconception and habit, all ideas will be able to reflect themselves there with a minimum of distortion, and we shall have acquired bodhi (knowledge), we shall have acquired the power of reflecting the rays of the Sun of Truth<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="83-2" href="#">2</a> — such was the hope which Siddhartha Gautama held out to us.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 538">“One who is without darkness, free from blemish, of blameless conduct, perfectly pure, that one, even though he does not know and has never heard and in short has no knowledge, however little, of any of the things that are in the world of the ten regions since time without beginning until today, none the less, he possesses the highest knowledge of the one who knows all. He is the one of whom it is said: Clarity.” You see here a panegyric of the direct relationship with the idea as opposed to the wholly external and superficial method of erudition.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 539">The advantages of this direct relationship are incalculable. It enables us to recover and love the idea behind all appearances, all veils, all forms, even the most barbarous, the most crude, the most superstitious.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 540">Thus we can put into living practice the state of mind of the sage, of which I spoke to you in my first talk and which a master defines in this way:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 541">“One who advances in Truth is not troubled by any error, for he knows that error is the first effort of life towards truth.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 542">Consequently, not a single fragment of an idea can ever be lost for us; wherever it is concealed, we know how to discover and cherish it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 543">Moreover, when we have become familiar with an idea, when we know it in itself, for itself, we recognise it behind the most diverse appearances, the most varied forms.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 544">This faculty can even serve as a criterion to discover whether someone is in contact with the idea itself, that is to say, whether he has understood it well and made it his own or whether he is part of the mass of those who have assimilated as best they could a doctrine, a special language, and who can think only in the words of that language — outside this formula, they no longer understand anything.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 550">Madame Martial was telling you very rightly last Friday that it would be wrong for women to want to think in the same way as men, that they would be in danger of losing their own qualities — profound intuition and practical deduction — without acquiring those of their masculine counterparts — logical reasoning and the capacity of analysis and synthesis.</p>

Those who, as a result of the teaching they have received and the cerebral gymnastics they have undertaken, are fond of taking up vast metaphysical problems, will find an excellent opportunity to do so at the <em>École de la Pensée</em> on the first Friday of each month.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="86-1" href="#">1</a></p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-86-1"><sup>1</sup> <em>Alternative version intended for another group</em>:<br/>
            I do not know if you are familiar with the notion of thought as a living and autonomous entity. I shall not venture here to prove its exactitude to you, and this for two reasons.
            The first is that in order to explain the smallest phenomenon (for such is our usual way of proving its reality to ourselves), it is necessary to bring in the most universal general laws. Many times we have been led to observe that the whole universe is necessary to explain a grain of sand. And this enquiry would lead us really too far tonight.
            On the other hand, to do this, we would have to devote ourselves to lengthy metaphysical speculations, and there is nothing I dread more than this form of mental activity.
            Faithful in this matter to the teaching of the Buddha, I am convinced that we can make a far better use of our time and minds than in hazardous excursions into the intellectual realm which, in the last analysis, always eludes our enquiry and inevitably brings us face to face with the unthinkable.
            The Buddha always categorically refused to answer any metaphysical question on the origin or the end of the universe, saying that only one thing matters: to advance on the Way, that is, to purify oneself inwardly, to destroy in oneself all egoistic desire.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 554">Women, by their very nature, are more capable of taking the spiritual or, in the deepest sense of the word, moral standpoint.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 555">We are essentially realistic and formative in this spiritual domain; we want to know how to live well, and for this we must learn how to think well.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 557">A little observation will enable us to realise that very often, for example, we receive thoughts which come to us from outside, although we have not been brought into contact with them either by speech or reading.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 558">Who has not also observed this phenomenon: a thought which is “in the air”, as we say, and which several inventors, several scientists, several literary men receive simultaneously without having been in physical communication on this matter?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 559">One could go on giving examples indefinitely. I leave each one to reflect and find the examples which seem most conclusive to her.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 560">Before proceeding further with our subject I shall read you a page on thought which may help you to understand it. It is a page from an as yet unpublished philosophical volume.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 561">“Any phenomenon implies a corresponding substance; any</p>

<p class="PE">vibration necessitates a medium of its own; and if vibrations of light require the medium which we know as ether, will not a medium be needed for the more subtle, more mysterious and also more rapid vibrations of thought?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 562">“I am not speaking of a thought which has already assumed the form and substance provided by the materiality of the brain. Psychologists know very well that before it attains to its modes of conscious activity there, a thought must first of all have passed through remoter states, through the unknown regions of what we call the subconscient.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 563">“It has come from the inner depths to our surface self like a meteor reaching us from inaccessible spaces.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 564">“What was the origin of this meteor, the source of this thought? We do not know, but they exist, the one beyond our sun, the other probably beyond light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 565">"There is a relationship of ascendance between light and thought. To go from one to the other in the scale of imponderables, it is necessary to mount a step: conceiving (<em>concevoir</em>) is a higher way of seeing (<em>voir</em>).</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 566">“If we do not see thought, it is because its substance is more ethereal than that of light; just as, if we do not hear light, it is because its essence is more subtle than that of sound.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 567">“Among the elements of its own order, thought moves just as our bodies do among physical objects. Just as our hands know how to shape these objects, in the same way thought also knows how to mould these elements and cast them into a myriad appropriate forms.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 568">“Thus our intellectual gestures are no less fruitful than our physical gestures. And that is why wisdom has always taught that we must watch over our thoughts as we would over generating acts.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 569">So we see that thought, which is a dynamism in the highest sense of the word, acts in its own realm as a formative power in order to build a body for itself. It acts like a magnet on iron filings. It</p>
<span id="page_89"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 89</p>
<p class="PE">attracts all the elements which are akin to its own character, aim and tendencies, and it vivifies these elements — which are the constituent cells of its own body, that I shall call fluidic to avoid going into too many explanations — it animates them, moulds them, gives them the form which is best suited to its own nature.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 570">We shall find a striking analogy between the work of thought and the work of the inventor, the builder of any kind.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 571">Let us take as an example a steam engine. The engineer draws up a plan in its smallest details, calculates and arranges everything, then he selects the appropriate materials for the materialisation of his conception, watches over the construction, etc.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 572">And when the engine works, becoming by its movement a real living being, it will be the most complete possible manifestation of the thought which has built it, it will give the full measure of the power of this thought. (The awakened unconsciousness of locomotives, cars, ships.) The formative thought, a living entity, animates the body which has been built for it by the hands of men. In the mental domain also, there are conscious builders.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 573">There are people who are specially gifted or who have developed certain inner senses in themselves, who can come into direct contact with this domain, mainly through vision and touch.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 574">When they are thus able to watch over the working of the phenomenon, they can, like chemists in their laboratories, manipulate substances, select them, mould them by their will-power and clothe their thoughts in forms that can manifest them fully.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 575">But this is the ultimate stage of one of the many paths of individual progress. Long before achieving this full consciousness, it is possible to make powerful formations. Any person whose thought has any strength and persistence is constantly making formations without being aware of it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 576">If you keep in mind that these formations are living entities always acting in the direction imparted to them by the thoughts which have given them birth, you will easily perceive the considerable consequences of these mental acts.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 577">Just as a good, kind, just and lofty thought can be eminently</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 578">On this matter, I shall quote to you a passage from the Dhammapada which will give you an idea of the enormous importance attributed to thought by the wisdom of the past.</p>

<p class="PE">war of idea against idea, for the thoughts that are disinterested, lofty and noble to give battle to those that are selfish, base and vulgar. This is a real hand-to-hand fight, a struggle of each minute which demands considerable mental power and clarity. For to fight against thoughts it is first of all necessary to receive them, to admit them into oneself, deliberately allow oneself to be contaminated, absorb the sickness into oneself the better to destroy the deadly germ by healing oneself. It is a real war in which one imperils one’s mental balance at every minute — and a war demands warriors. I shall not recommend this practice to anyone.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 601">To win this victory we must build up in ourselves a mentality whose quality is the opposite of that of the surrounding medium.

            For nothing is more pernicious to ourselves and to others than this uncharitable state of mind. How many times have we not felt a kind of insurmountable barrier rising up between ourselves and someone we know. And yet towards this person, our words and acts have always been perfectly courteous and occasionally even very friendly.
            But where this person is concerned, within ourselves, we have given rein to this spirit of analysis and criticism which lightly dismisses good qualities and fastens only on shortcomings, no doubt without any spitefulness, but with a shade of irony or malice, a feeling of our own superiority—wretched as we are! And so, little by little, drop by drop, between this person and ourselves, a veritable river is formed which separates us more and more from each other, despite whatever physical efforts we may make to come closer together.

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="charity" style="font-style:italic">Charity</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 634">In its most general sense, charity may be defined as the act of giving to each one what he lacks.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 635">That is to say, in the last analysis, to put each thing in its place, which would result in the establishment of the supreme justice upon earth.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 636">Such is the theory, but in practice charity could be considered as the path men ought to follow in their groping advance towards justice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 637">For, in his present state of evolution, man is incapable not only of realising justice in his earthly abode, but also of conceiving it as it is in its absolute essence. Charity is the living acknowledgment of this inability.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 638">Indeed, in our ignorance of true justice, the justice which is one with perfect harmony, perfect equilibrium and perfect order, our wisest course is to take the path of love, the path of charity which shuns all judgment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 639">This is what justifies the attitude of those who always set charity against justice. Justice is, in their eyes, rigorous, merciless, and charity must come to temper its excessive severity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 640">Certainly, they cannot speak thus of divine justice, but more rightly of human or rather of social justice, the egoistic justice which is instituted to defend a more or less extensive grouping of interests and is as much opposed to true justice as shadow is contrary to light.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 641">When we speak of justice as it is rendered in our so-called civilised countries, we should call it not rigorous and merciless but blind and monstrous in its ignorant pretension.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 642">So we can never make too many amends for its fatal effects, and there charity finds an opportunity to apply itself fruitfully.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 643">But this is only one side of the question and before delving deeper into our subject, I would like to remind you that charity,</p>
<span id="page_99"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 99</p>
<p class="PE">like all other human activities, is exercised according to four different modes which must be simultaneous if its action is to be integral and truly effective. I mean that no charity is complete if it is not at the same time material, intellectual, spiritual or moral and, above all, loving, for the very essence of charity is love.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 644">At present charity is considered almost exclusively from the external standpoint and the word is synonymous with the sharing of part of one’s possessions with life’s rejects. We shall see in a moment how mean this conception is even when confined to the purely material field.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 645">The three other modes of action of charity are admirably summed up in this counsel given by the Buddha to his disciples:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 646">“With your hearts overflowing with compassion, go forth into this world torn by pain, be instructors, and wherever the darkness of ignorance rules, there light a torch.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 647">To instruct those who know less, to give to those who do evil the strength to come out of their error, to console those who suffer, these are all occupations of charity rightly understood.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 648">Thus charity, regarded from the individual point of view, consists, for each one, of giving to others all they need, in proportion to one’s means.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 649">This brings us to two observations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 650">The first is that one cannot give what one does not have at one’s command.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 651">Materially this is so evident that it is unnecessary to insist upon it. But intellectually, spiritually, the same rule holds true.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 652">Indeed, how can one teach others what one does not know?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 653">How can one guide the weak on the path of wisdom if one does not tread the path oneself? How can one radiate love if one does not possess it within oneself?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 654">And the supreme charity, which is integral self-giving to the great work of terrestrial regeneration, implies first of all that one can command what one wants to offer, that is to say, that one is master of oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 655">Only he who has perfect self-control can consecrate himself</p>
<span id="page_100"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 100</p>
<p class="PE">in all sincerity to the great work. For he alone knows that no contrary will, no unexpected impulse can ever again come to impede his action, to check his effort by setting him at variance with himself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 656">In this fact we find the justification of the old proverb which says: “Charity begins at home.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 657">This maxim seems to encourage every kind of egoism, and yet it is the expression of a great wisdom for one who understands it rightly.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 658">It is because charitable people fail to conform to this principle that their efforts so often remain unfruitful, that their goodwill is so often warped in its results, and that, in the end, they are forced to renounce a charity which, because it has not been rightly exercised, is the cause of nothing but confusion, suffering and disillusionment.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 659">There is evidently a wrong way of interpreting this maxim, which says, “First let us accumulate fortune, intelligence, health, love, energies of all kinds, then we shall distribute them.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 660">For, from the material standpoint, when will the accumulation stop? One who acquires the habit of piling up never finds his pile big enough.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 661">I have even been led to make an observation about this: that in most men generosity seems to exist in inverse proportion to their pecuniary resources.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 662">From observing the way in which workmen, the needy and all the unfortunate act among themselves, I was forced to conclude that the poor are far more charitable, far more prepared to succour their fellow-sufferers than are those more favoured by fortune. There is not enough time to go into the details of all that I have seen, but I assure you that it is instructive. I can, in any case, assure you that if the rich, in proportion to what they have, gave as much as the poor, soon there would no longer be a single starving person in the world.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 663">Thus gold seems to attract gold, and nothing would be more fatal than wanting to accumulate riches before distributing them.</p>
<span id="page_101"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 101</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 664">But also, nothing would be more fatal than a rash prodigality which, from lack of discernment, would squander a fortune without benefiting anyone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 665">Let us never confuse disinterestedness, which is one of the conditions of true charity, with a lack of concern that springs from idle thoughtlessness.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 666">Let us learn therefore to make judicious use of what we may have or earn while giving the least possible play to our personality and, above all, let us not forget that charity should not be confined to material aid.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 667">Nor in the field of forces is it possible to accumulate, for receptivity occurs in proportion to expenditure: the more one expends usefully, the more one makes oneself capable of receiving. Thus the intelligence one can acquire is proportionate to the intelligence one uses. We are formed to manifest a certain quantity of intellectual forces, but if we develop ourselves mentally, if we put our brains to work, if we meditate regularly and above all if we make others benefit by the fruit, however modest, of our efforts, we make ourselves capable of receiving a greater quantity of ever deeper and purer intellectual forces. And the same holds true for love and spirituality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 668">We are like channels: if we do not allow what they have received to pour out freely, not only do they become blocked and no longer receive anything, but what they contain will spoil. If, on the contrary, we allow all this flood of vital, intellectual and spiritual forces to flow abundantly, if by impersonalising ourselves we know how to connect our little individuality to the great universal current, what we give will be returned to us a hundredfold.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 669">To know how not to cut ourselves off from the great universal current, to be a link in the chain which must not be broken, this is the true science, the very key of charity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 670">Unfortunately there exists a very widespread error which is a serious obstacle to the practical application of this knowledge. This error lies in the belief that a thing in the universe may</p>
<span id="page_102"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 102</p>
<p class="PE">be our own possession. Everything belongs to all, and to say or think, “This is mine”, is to create a separation, a division which does not exist in reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 671">Everything belongs to all, even the substance of which we are made, a whirl of atoms in perpetual movement which momentarily constitutes our organism without abiding in it and which, tomorrow, will form another.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 672">It is true that some people command great material possessions. But in order to be in accord with the universal law, they should consider themselves as trustees, stewards of these possessions. They ought to know that these riches are entrusted to them so that they may administer them for the best interests of all.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 673">We have come a long way from the narrow conception of charity restricted to the giving of a little of what we have in excess to the unfortunate ones that life brings in our way! And what we say of material riches must be said of spiritual wealth also.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 674">Those who say, “This idea is mine”, and who think they are very charitable in allowing others to profit from it, are senseless.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 675">The world of ideas belongs to all; intellectual force is a universal force.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 676">It is true that some people are more capable than others of entering into relation with this field of ideas and manifesting it through their conscious cerebrality. But this is nothing other than an additional responsibility for them: since they are in possession of this wealth, they are its stewards and must see that it is used for the good of the greatest number.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 677">The same holds true for all the other universal forces. Only the concept of union, of the perfect identity of everything and everyone, can lead to true charity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 678">But to come back to practice, there is one more serious pitfall in the way of its complete and fruitful manifestation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 679">For most people, charity consists of giving anything to anyone without even knowing whether this gift corresponds to a need.</p>
<span id="page_103"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 103</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 680">Thus charity is made synonymous with sentimental weakness and irrational squandering.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 681">Nothing is more contrary to the very essence of this virtue. Indeed, to give someone a thing he has no need of is as great a lack of charity as to deny him what he needs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 682">And this applies to the things of the spirit as well as to those of the body.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 683">By a faulty distribution of material possessions one can hasten the downfall of certain individuals by encouraging them to be lazy, instead of favouring their progress by inciting them to effort.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 684">The same holds true for intelligence and love. To give someone a knowledge which is too strong for him, thoughts which he cannot assimilate, is to deprive him for long, if not for ever, of the possibility of thinking for himself.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 718">All the prophets, all the instructors who have come to bring the divine word to men, have, on one point at least, given an identical teaching.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 719">All of them have taught us that the greatest truths are sterile unless they are transformed through us into useful actions. All have proclaimed the necessity of living their revelation in daily life. All have declared that they show us the path but that we must tread it ourselves; no being, however great, can do our work in our stead.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 720">Baha Ullah was no exception to this rule. I shall not quote the texts to you, you know them as well and better than I do. How many times Abdul Baha has said: “Do not talk, act; words are of no use without actions, we must be an example to the world.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 721">It is indeed very necessary that each one of us should be an example to the world. For it is only by showing to men how an inner commerce with the eternal truths transforms disorder into harmony and suffering into peace, that we shall induce them to follow the way which will lead them towards liberation. But Abdul Baha is not content to give us this teaching, he is living it, and therein lies all his power of persuasion.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 743">“So long as we imagine that the whole universal reality is con-fined to the one order of substance, to the one state of materiality perceived by our senses, we know nothing and can explain nothing.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 744">“When science endeavoured to understand what light is, it had to break out of the too narrow space and too limited area of perceptible phenomena, and it postulated, under the name of ether, a subtle state of reality. But, in reaching this state, it has taken only its first steps on the path of infinite transcendence....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 745">“Thus, we can now become aware that the realm of being which we know is merely the field of manifestation, of a more complete materialisation of its own distant and anterior modes, the last among the fields of life.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 746">“If we could perceive the living images which thoughts produce around us at each moment, if we could measure the force of their power of formation, we would understand what can be created by the concourse of our converging wills and the formidable concert of the collective ideas and beliefs of a people, a civilisation, a race.”</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 747">“Certainly, all ideas are not creative to the same degree. In fact, few minds are capable of thinking real thoughts; and most individual mental formations are no more than distortions, malformations of stereotypes formed by some anonymous thinker which have become common property. The forms they assume in the intellectual substance are usually crude and stupid; besides, they do not last long.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 748">“But as soon as an idea becomes an idea-force, a true mental dynamism, it tends to produce and maintain its plastic representation in a more stable and precise form.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 769">Last Monday, Abdul Baha took leave of us; in a very few days he will have left Paris, and I know many hearts which will feel a great void and will grieve.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 770">Yet only the body is leaving us, and what is the body if not precisely that in which men are most alike, be they great or small, wise or ignorant, terrestrial or divine? Yes, you may rest assured that only his body is leaving us; his thought will remain faithfully with us, and his unchanging affection will enfold us, and his spiritual influence will always be the same, absolutely the same. Whether materially he is near or far matters little, for the divine forces elude completely the laws of the material world: they are omnipresent, always at work to satisfy every receptivity, every sincere aspiration.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 771">So although it may be pleasant for our outer being to see his physical appearance or hear his voice, to dwell in his presence, we must truly tell ourselves that, inasmuch as it seems</p>
<span id="page_114"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 114</p>
<p class="PE">indispensable to us, this shows that we are still little conscious of the inner life, the true life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 772">Even if we do not attain to the marvellous depths of the divine life, of which only very rare individuals are constantly conscious, already in the domain of thought we escape the laws of time and space.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 773">To think of someone is to be near him, and wherever two beings may find themselves, even if they are physically separated by thousands of kilometres, if they think of each other they are together in a very real way. If we are able to concentrate our thought sufficiently and to concentrate sufficiently in our thought, we can become integrally conscious of what we are thinking of, and if it is a man, sometimes see or hear him — in any case know his thought.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 774">Thus separation no longer exists, it is an illusory appearance. And in France, in America, in Persia or in China, we are always near the one we love and think of.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 775">But this fact is all the more real in a case such as ours, where we want to come into contact with an especially active and conscious thought, a thought which assumes and manifests an infinite love, a thought which enfolds the whole earth with a loving and fatherly solicitude that is only too glad to come to the help of those who entrust themselves to it.</p>

As the terrestrial being grows more receptive to the divine forces and manifests them in its illumined activities, one can identify oneself with it once more and cease to distinguish between the instrument and the Doer.

Perfect impersonality—whether in the <em>prana</em> or in the other worlds of being—lies in identification with the terrestrial <em>prana</em>, or rather with the divine bliss deep within all sensations as within all universal activities. The result is that instead of feeling the joy of a sensation, one is this very sensation in all those who enjoy it. Then the individual <em>prana</em> no longer exists; but there is instead a force, at once impersonal and conscious, which manifests in all the organs that are capable of perceiving it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 780">For example, there is a subtle joy, both sweet and profound, in the sensation one feels while walking alone or with a companion with whom one is in perfect harmony, through seldom trod or virgin tracts of countryside unspoiled by any human atmosphere, where Nature is tranquil, vast, pure like an aspiration, holy like a prayer; on mountains, in forests, along stray paths beside limpid streams, or on the shores of a boundless ocean.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 783">Then as I watched thee in the silence, thou didst speak to me more deeply still, and thou didst tell me of the great mystery of eternal Love that loves itself in all forms and is self-revealed in all activities. Already in my being this ineffable Love lived self-aware, but at that hour its life took on an exceptional intensity, or perhaps the individual perception was exceptionally clear. O adorable Lord, Sovereign Master of the world, Thou who, being all, possessest and delightest in all, didst Thou in that moment of Thy eternity cast a closer glance towards us, that we were thus bathed in such a magnificence of love? Or was it that Thou didst wish, in the humble instrument of this ephemeral and limited being, to taste more strongly and fully, with more intensity and precision, Thy own delight of being and self-manifestation? Suddenly all was lit with the inexpressible beauty of Thy Truth, and in the mirror of the individual consciousness Thou didst reflect all the infinitely varied modes of self-expression of Thy</p>

Oh, how well it understood Thee, this portion of Thyself that has crystallised into what I call my being, how powerfully it loved Thee in those unforgettable moments! All barriers of thought and sensation had vanished, consumed by the ardour of Thy divine fire, and indeed it was Thou who at that moment didst delight in Thy eternal and infinite presence in all things. Thou wast all actions and all resistances, all sensations and all thoughts, the one who loves and the one who is loved, that which gives itself and that which receives, in an inexhaustible and ever-moving harmony.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 785">To know how to renounce the satisfaction of the present moment for the sake of realising one’s ideal is the great art of those who want to make their transient, total existence yield its utmost.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 786">There are innumerable categories of “successful” people; these categories are determined by the greater or lesser breadth, nobility, complexity, purity and luminosity of their ideal. One may “succeed” as a rag-picker or “succeed” as master of the world or even as a perfect ascetic; in all three cases, although on very different levels, it is one’s more or less integral and extensive self-mastery which makes the “success” possible.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 787">On the other hand, there is only one way of being a “failure”; and that happens to the greatest, to the most sovereign intelligence, as well as to the smallest, the most limited, to all those who are unable to subordinate the sensation of the present moment to the ideal they wish to achieve, but without having the strength to take up the path — identical for all in nature if not in extent and complexity — that leads to this achievement.</p>

There are ambitions which pursue mere personal interests, material, sentimental or intellectual, others which have more general, more collective or higher aims, and yet others which are superhuman, so to say, and strive to scale the peaks that open on the splendours of eternal Truth, eternal Consciousness and eternal Peace.

The “I” knows itself to be completely independent of the present mode of manifestation — form, body, surroundings, education, sensory experiences; it is a constituent element of the All, an infinitesimal part of the universe; its duration as an “I” is identical to the duration of the universe and dependent on it. It knows that only That which is not an “I” can be free from this dependence, can be eternally. The “I” knows that it is perfectly surrendered to That which it cannot think, that it is moved by That, and therefore it does not say, “I want”, but “I have to want” or “I am made to</p>

Where then is the self, that is to say, something permanent, constant, ever the same? In order to find it, to find this absolute, we must proceed from depth to depth, from relativity to relativity—for all that is in form is relative—until we reach That which is Unthinkable to our reason, Unutterable to our language, but knowable by identification—for we carry That in ourselves, it is the very centre and life of <em>our</em> being.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 827">There should be two parallel movements in the evolution of an individual; and it is because he generally neglects one or the other of these movements in order to concentrate on one alone, that his progress is so halting and so unbalanced.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 828">One of these movements is to become conscious of all the constituent elements of the being, material and sensory as well as intellectual and spiritual; we must become acquainted with the mechanism of the life within us, with all its tendencies, qualities, faculties and varied activities, very impartially, that is, without any preconceived idea of good or evil, without any absolute or arbitrary judgment (for our judgments are inevitably lacking in clear-sightedness) about what should subsist and what should disappear, what should be encouraged and what should be suppressed. Our vision of what we are must be objective, without bias, if we want it to be sincere and integral: we are faced with a universe which we must explore down to its smallest details, know in its most obscure and infinitesimal elements, with a scientific attitude of perfect mental impersonality, that is, without any <em>a priori</em> judgments.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 829">Whatever we may think, this work of observation, analysis and introspection is never completed. At all events, as long as we are on earth in a physical body, we should always study the immensely complex being that we are, so that no element may elude our knowledge and therefore our control: <em>for we can only master what we know and command what we have mastered</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 830">This brings us to the second movement which should exist parallel to and simultaneous with the first. It is the consecration, the constant and constantly repeated surrender of all the elements subject to our control to the Supreme and Divine Law. Each element that has become conscious of itself, each ten-</p>
<span id="page_129"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 129</p>
<p class="PE">dency, each faculty, must surrender to the Sovereign Guidance of the Eternal Essence of Being, with the simple trust of a child; She will order, classify and utilise all these elements in the right way; She and She alone can separate what can be used from what cannot, what must be encouraged from what must be eliminated; and, no doubt, as before Her all is of equal value, all can be used, since by Her all is transformed, illumined, transfigured: all that becomes conscious of Her and gives itself to Her becomes Herself and thus escapes all notions of good and evil, which are purely external and human.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 831">One of these movements, one of these attitudes without the other is incomplete and one-sided. To consecrate our being in one block to the Supreme Essence is not enough: all the elements that we do not know and have not mastered elude this consecration and therefore follow their own law instead of conforming to the Eternal Law, and become the source of every disturbance, every unexpected revolt in one who had yet thought himself to be entirely a servant of The Law. But he was forgetful of all the unknown nooks in his being which also have a claim to life and activity and which are manifested in their turn, but in an activity that is disorderly and disharmonious relative to the being as a whole, since they elude the central will.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 832">On the other hand, to become conscious of ourselves in our smallest details is vain and sterile, even dangerous, if it is not done for the sake of order, so that the Divine Essence can be made the Omnipotent ruler of all these elements, if we do not secure their unreserved surrender to Her supreme guidance, to The Sovereign Law.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 833">Only in the balanced union of these two attitudes can one truly, integrally, call oneself a Servant of the Eternal.</p>

The summit of the mountain was covered with rich pastures. In these pastures, four herds of cows were grazing, guarded by four cowherds. These herds were at an equal distance from one another, thus forming approximately the four corners of a square. Each guardian had his own very particular appearance and characteristics. “He” was seeking something that he wanted to express and make effective, and for this he lacked certain elements. These elements lay beyond the summit of the mountain and He was asking me if there was any way of going there to fetch them. The question was voiced aloud and all the cows of the herd that was nearest to us bounded towards Him, lowing with delight. The man who was leading them, tall, strong, stocky, clothed in animal skins, white-skinned and very hairy, with black, shaggy hair and a square face, went towards Him and said to Him in a loud voice, “I put myself entirely at your disposal, my cows want to serve you and so do I. I shall lead them to the place where the elements of knowledge you want to acquire are lying and we shall bring them to you.”</p>

One part of his garment was red, but there were several other colours. He was friendly and well-disposed. But he did not offer his services.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 847">We were advancing along the broad white highway which led to our goal, when at a fork in the road we saw a great number of people massing and huddling together with expressions of terror. We wonder why as we proceed on our way, when we hear ourselves being called by a shepherd dressed in white, who tells us to join the people on the bank by the roadside. And in answer to our enquiry, he tells us that an enormous herd of cows and bulls has been kept prisoner until now, but that the time has come to let them loose, that the rope which is holding them back will be removed, and that they are going to charge and are likely to destroy everything in their path. I reply, “Indeed these creatures are full of vigour and sometimes even of apparently blind violence, but for people such as we two who are walking straight on our way, there is nothing to fear; bulls have never done us any harm.” But the shepherd insists, saying that it is really something exceptional and unprecedented. So as not to vex him we stop and stand by the roadside in front of the crowding people. But there again he insists, saying, “Not there, not there, you will be trampled down, behind.” And he makes us stand behind all the others, back from the side of the road.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 848">At that moment, in the distance, I catch sight of the immense herd of cows and bulls; the rope that held them back is removed and they surge forward, charging straight in front of them; and if anyone had been in their path, they would certainly have trampled him down. When all have passed, the leader of the herd, who had been kept until last, is let loose. He is a splendid, enormous white bull. Instead of following the same path as the others, he turns to the right, in front of us, following the descending path. But after a moment he stops, looking for something, does not find it, retraces his steps, and finally stations himself just in front of me. Then I see that it is a triple bull, composed of three bulls closely bound together. One of the three (the middle one, I think) was a little less white than the</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 133</p>
<p class="PE">two others. To my left there was a priest who, at the sight of this enormous creature charging upon us and halting just in front of me, is seized with a great fear. And in his fright he begins to move restlessly. Then I say to him, “Well then, what about your faith in God? If He has decided that you are to be trampled down by this bull, won’t you find that His will is good?” Rather ashamed of himself, he wants to look brave, so he starts talking to the bull and giving him friendly pats on the muzzle. But the powerful creature was beginning to lose patience. And I was thinking, “With his fear, this fool will really end up by causing a disaster.” “We had better go away,” I said, turning towards “Him”. And without any further care for the bull, we set out on our way once more. We have scarcely taken a few steps on the road when we see the bull quietly passing beside us, calm and strong. A little farther on, I see another bull coming in the opposite direction, all reddish-brown, with a wild and ferocious look, charging with its huge horns pointed forward. I look back towards “Him”, walking a few steps behind me, and I say to him, “This one is the really dangerous creature, the one that is alone and going in the opposite direction to the others. This one has evil intentions. It cannot even see us because we are on the straight path and are protected. But I am much afraid for the others.” Still a little farther on we hear a galloping sound behind us, as if the ferocious bull were coming back with others. I feel that it is time for us to reach the goal. At that moment the road seems to be closed; in front of us there is a door that I want to open, but my hand slips on the knob and I cannot turn it. And yet time is pressing. Then I distinctly hear the deep Voice, “Look.” I look up, and right in front of us, beside the closed door, I see a wide-open door leading into a square room which is the goal. And the voice resumes, “Enter. That is where all the doors are to be found and you will be able to open them all.” With a feeling of great peace and tranquil strength I woke up.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 851">This is what I remember of it:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 852">At the top of a very high tower standing on a high mountain, in a room so vast that it seemed to be low, I was leaning against the far wall, and facing me was a window looking outside. On my left a raised throne with several steps, and on the throne sat the Lord of Nations. This I knew although I had not looked at him. To my right at the far end of the immense room, in a kind of alcove lit from above, sat a young woman — a nation. She was a small, dumpy child with very dark hair and a pale and mat complexion. She had put on a wedding-dress, with a crown of white flowers on her head (the dress was mostly white with some blue and a few touches of gold). I knew that I had helped this nation to dress in this way, and to climb the mountain and the tower to come up to the room. She had come to offer herself as a bride to the Lord of Nations, and for this purpose she was to undergo a series of ordeals that the Lord wanted to impose upon her in order to know whether she was worthy of him. These ordeals were the ordeals of Terror.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 853">For the first ordeal he had a full glass as well as a decanter brought to her. And she was to drink the contents of both. To her they seemed to be blood — human blood newly shed. And He, from the height of his throne, was saying to her, “Drink this blood to show that you are not afraid.” The poor child was trembling with disgust and did not dare touch the ghastly beverage. But at that hour, Lord, You had given me the full consciousness and power of the Truth.

It is a moving sight, not so much because of all that these unfortunate men are suffering, but above all because of the noble manner in which most of them bear their sufferings. Their soul shines through their eyes, the slightest contact with the deeper forces awakens it. And from the intensity, the fullness of the powers of true love which could, in their presence, be manifested in perfect silence, it was easy to realise the value of their receptivity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 868">Then the mentality which takes pleasure in making constructions for realisation begins to imagine all that could be accomplished with the help of this receptivity. And scenes, both vast and complex, of possible realisations follow one after another, streaming endlessly in the splendour of their light and love.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 869">Besides, at present, the smallest incident, the slightest contact with the outside world serves as a pretext for innumerable constructions which to the mentality appear vast, luminous, full of an intense life and a great power for realisation. They are like so many outer frames or forms of manifestation offered for the approval and the choice of That which wants to manifest — but at the side of the daring constructor stands the loving and docile child who, in an ardent aspiration towards the Supreme Principle of Truth, softly murmurs: “Lord, I am ignorant of Thy Will in its entirety, I construct events which are commensurate with my paltry individual limitations and which probably fit very badly into the immensity of Thy plan. But Thou knowest that they are nothing but fleeting constructions which are dissolved as soon as they are created and which in no way mar the purity of the mental mirror ready to reflect at each moment the appropriate transcription of what Thou willest the integral instrument to</p>

And in the silence of contemplation the mentality knows that all these diverse constructions which present themselves to it are part of a whole which will be given to it to manifest progressively, perhaps through the medium of several bodily instruments. And the simultaneous vision of That which is and that which is becoming takes hold of this consciousness and does not leave it for many hours, hours ever more frequent and lasting.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 878">You have asked me what I think of the feminist movement and what will be the consequences of the present war for it.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 879">One of the first effects of the war has certainly been to give quite a new aspect to the question. The futility of the perpetual oppositions between men and women was at once made clearly apparent, and behind the conflict of the sexes, only relating to exterior facts, the gravity of the circumstances allowed the discovery of the always existent, if not always outwardly manifested fact, of the real collaboration, of the true union of these two complementary halves of humanity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 880">Many men were surprised to see how easily women could replace them in most of the posts they occupied before, and to their surprise was added something of regret not to have found sooner a real partner of their work and their struggles in her whom more often they had only considered as an object of pleasure and distraction, or at best as the guardian of their hearth and mother of their children. Certainly woman is that and to be it well requires exceptional qualities, but she is not only that, as the present circumstances have amply proved.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 881">In going to tend the wounded in the most difficult material conditions, actually under the enemy’s fire, the so-called weak sex has proved that its physical energy and power of endurance were equal to those of man. But where, above all, women have given proof of exceptional gifts is in their organising faculties. These faculties of administration were recognised in them long ago by the Brahmanic India of before the Mohammedan conquest. There is a popular adage there which says: “Property governed by woman means prosperous property.” But in the Occident Semitic thought allied to Roman legislation has influenced</p>
<span id="page_142"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 142</p>
<p class="PE">customs too deeply for women to have the opportunity of showing their capacity for organisation.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 882">It is true that in France one frequently sees the woman absolute mistress of the administration of her house even from the pecuniary point of view, and the proverbial riches of the French <em>petite bourgeoisie</em> proves that the system has a good side. It was rare however to see the feminine faculties utilised to direct undertakings of great importance, and until now the confidential posts of public administration had always been closed to them. The present war has shown that in refusing the co-operation of women the governments deprived themselves of precious help. I will cite you an event as example.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 883">A few months after the outbreak of the war, when the Germans had almost entirely occupied the Belgian territory, the inhabitants of the invaded regions were in indescribable misery. Fortunately, thanks to the initiative of several rich American men and women, a Society was founded to supply the most urgent needs of the sorely tried populations. As the result of certain military operations a fairly large group of small villages were suddenly deprived of all food. Famine was imminent. The American Society sent a message to some similar English Societies asking that five vans of the most indispensable supplies should be dispatched immediately. These vans must reach their destination in three days. The men to whom this request was addressed replied that it was quite impossible to comply with it. Luckily a woman heard of the matter. It seemed terrible to her that in such tragic circumstances one could use the word “impossible”. She belonged to a group of women who aided the wounded and sufferers of the war. Immediately they promised the American Society they would satisfy it and in three days the numerous obstacles were overcome though some of the difficulties, especially those concerning transport, seemed truly unsurmountable. A powerful organising mind, an ardent will, had done the miracle: the provisions arrived in time and the dreadful misery of famine was thus avoided.</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 143</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 884">This is not to say that only woman’s exceptional qualities have been revealed by the present war. Her weaknesses, her faults, her pettiness have also been given the opportunity of display, and certainly if women wish to take the place they claim in the governing of nations they must progress much further in the mastery of self, the broadening of ideas and points of view, in intellectual suppleness and oblivion of their sentimental preferences in order to become worthy of the management of public affairs.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 885">It is certain that purely masculine politics have given proof of incapacity; they have foundered too often in their search of strictly personal interest, and in their arbitrary and violent action. Doubtless women’s politics would bring about a tendency to disinterestedness and more humanitarian solutions. But unfortunately, in their present state, women in general are creatures of passion and enthusiastic partisanship; they lack the reasoning calm that purely intellectual activity gives; the latter is undoubtedly dangerous because hard and cold and pitiless, nevertheless it is unquestionably useful to master the overflow of sentiment which cannot hold a predominant place in the ruling of collective interests.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 886">These faults which would be serious if the activity of women had to replace that of men, could form, on the contrary, by a collaboration of the two sexes, an element of compensation for the opposite faults of men. That would be the best means of leading them gradually to mutual perfecting. To reduce the woman’s part to solely interior and domestic occupations, and the man’s part to exclusively exterior and social occupations, thus separating what should be united, would be to perpetuate the present sad state of things, from which both are equally suffering. It is in front of the highest duties and heaviest responsibilities that their respective qualities must unite in a close and confident solidarity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 887">Is it not time that this hostile attitude of the two sexes facing one another as irreconcilable adversaries should cease? A severe, a painful lesson is being given to the nations. On the ruins piled</p>

<p class="PE">up now, new constructions more beautiful and more harmonious can be erected. It is no longer the moment for frail competitions and self-interested claims; all human beings, men or women, must associate in a common effort to become conscious of the highest ideal which asks to be realised and to work ardently for its realisation. The question to be solved, the real question is then not only that of a better utilisation of their outer activities, but above all that of an inner spiritual growth. Without inner progress there is no possible outer progress.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 888">Thus the problem of feminism, as all the problems of the world, comes back to a spiritual problem. For the spiritual reality is at the basis of all others; the divine world, the Dhammata of Buddhism, is the eternal foundation on which are built all the other worlds. In regard to this Supreme Reality all are equal, men and women, in rights and in duties; the only distinction which can exist in this domain being based on the sincerity and ardour of aspiration, on the constancy of the will. And it is in the recognition of this fundamental spiritual equality that can be found the only serious and lasting solution for this problem of the relation of the sexes. It is in this light that it must be placed, it is at this height that must be sought the focus of action and new life, around which will be constructed the future temple of Humanity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 890">Woman, by the very fact of her passivity, having more easily than man the intuition of the Supreme Power at work in the world, is more often, more naturally humble.</p>

<h1 class="Cp-Nm" id="impressions-of-japan" style="font-style:italic">Impressions of Japan</h1>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 895">You ask me for my impressions about Japan. To write on Japan is a difficult task; so many things have been already written, so many silly things also... but these more on the people than on their country. For the country is so wonderful, picturesque, many-sided, unexpected, charming, wild or sweet; it is in its appearance so much a synthesis of all the other countries of the world, from the tropical to the arctic, that no artistic eye can remain indifferent to it. I believe many excellent descriptions have been given of Japan; I shall not then attempt to add mine, which would certainly be far less interesting. But the people of Japan have, in general, been misunderstood and misinterpreted, and on that subject something worth saying remains to be said.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 896">In most cases foreigners come in touch with that part of the Japanese people which has been spoiled by foreigners, — a Japan of money-makers and imitators of the West; obviously they have proved very clever imitators, and you can easily find here a great many of those things which make the West hateful. If we judge Japan by her statesmen, her politicians and her businessmen, we shall find her a country very much like one of the Powers of Europe, though she possesses the vitality and concentrated energies of a nation which has not yet reached its zenith.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 897">That energy is one of the most interesting features of Japan. It is visible everywhere, in everyone; the old and the young, the workmen, the women, the children, the students, all, save perhaps the “new rich”, display in their daily life the most wonderful storage of concentrated energy. With their perfect love for nature and beauty, this accumulated strength is, perhaps, the most distinctive and widely spread characteristic of the Japanese. That is what you may observe as soon as you reach that land of</p>
<span id="page_147"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 147</p>
<p class="PE">the Rising Sun where so many people and so many treasures are gathered in a narrow island.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 898">But if you have — as we have had — the privilege of coming in contact with the true Japanese, those who kept untouched the righteousness and bravery of the ancient Samurai, then you can understand what in truth is Japan, you can seize the secret of her force. They know how to remain silent; and though they are possessed of the most acute sensitiveness, they are, among the people I have met, those who express it the least. A friend here can give his life with the greatest simplicity to save yours, though he never told you before he loved you in such a profound and unselfish way. Indeed he had not even told you that he had loved you at all. And if you were not able to read the heart behind the appearances, you would have seen only a very exquisite courtesy which leaves little room for the expression of spontaneous feelings. Nevertheless the feelings are there, all the stronger perhaps because of the lack of outward manifestation; and if an opportunity presents itself, through an act, very modest and veiled sometimes, you suddenly discover depths of affection.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 899">This is specifically Japanese; among the nations of the world, the true Japanese — those who have not become westernised — are perhaps the least selfish. And this unselfishness is not the privilege of the well-educated, the learned or the religious people; in all social ranks you may find it. For here, with the exception of some popular and exceedingly pretty festivals, religion is not a rite or a cult, it is a daily life of abnegation, obedience, self-sacrifice.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 900">The Japanese are taught from their infancy that life is duty and not pleasure. They accept that duty — so often hard and painful — with passive submission. They are not tormented by the idea of making themselves happy. It gives to the life of the whole country a very remarkable self-constraint, but no joyful and free expansion; it creates an atmosphere of tension and effort, of mental and nervous strain, not of spiritual peace like that which can be felt in India, for instance. Indeed, nothing in</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 901">Japan can be compared to the pure divine atmosphere which pervades India and makes of her such a unique and precious country; not even in the temples and the sacred monasteries always so wonderfully situated, sometimes on the summit of a high mountain covered with huge cedar trees, difficult to reach, far from the world below.... Exterior calm, rest and silence are there, but not that blissful sense of the infinite which comes from a living nearness to the Unique. True, here all speaks to the eyes and mind of unity — unity of God with man, unity of man with Nature, unity of man with man. But this unity is very little felt and lived. Certainly the Japanese have a highly developed sense of generous hospitality, reciprocal help, mutual support; but in their feelings, their thoughts, their actions in general, they are among the most individualist, the most separatist people. For them the form is predominant, the form is attractive. It is suggestive too, it speaks of some deeper harmony or truth, of some law of nature or life. Each form, each act is symbolical, from the arrangement of the gardens and the houses to the famous tea ceremony. And sometimes in a very simple and usual thing you discover a symbol, deep, elaborated, willed, that most of the people know and understand; but it is an exterior and learnt knowledge — a tradition, it is not living truth coming from the depth of spiritual experience, enlightening heart and mind. Japan is essentially the country of sensations; she lives through her eyes. Beauty rules over her as an uncontested master; and all her atmosphere incites to mental and vital activity, study, observation, progress, effort, not to silent and blissful contemplation. But behind this activity stands a high aspiration which the future of her people will reveal.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 903">We could quite well call Japan the paradise of children — in no other country have I seen them so free and so happy. After months of residence in Japan I have yet never seen a child beaten by a grown-up person. They are treated as if all the parents were conscious that the children are the promise and the glory of the future. And a wonderful thing is that, environed by so much attention, so much care, — indeed, such a devotion, they are the most reasonable, good and serious children I have ever met. When they are babies, tied up in an amusing fashion on their mothers’ backs, with their wide open black eyes they seem to consider life with gravity and to have already opinions on the things they look at. You scarcely hear a child cry. When, for instance, he has hurt himself and the tears burst out of his eyes, the mother or the father has but to say a few words in a low voice, and the sorrow seems to be swept away. What are those magic words which enable children to be so reasonable? Very simple indeed: “Are you not a Samurai?” And this question is sufficient for the child to call to him all his energy and to overcome his weakness.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 908">To speak of children to the women of Japan is, I think, to speak to them of their dearest, their most sacred subject. Indeed, in no other country in the world have the children taken such an important, such a primordial place. They are, here, the centre of care and attention. On them are concentrated — and rightly — the hopes for the future. They are the living promise of growing prosperity for the country. Therefore, the most important work assigned to women in Japan is child-making. Maternity is considered as the principal role of woman. But this is true only so long as we understand what is meant by the word maternity. For to bring children into the world as rabbits do their young — instinctively, ignorantly, machine-like, that certainly cannot be called maternity! True maternity begins with the conscious creation of a being, with the willed shaping of a soul coming to develop and utilise a new body. The true domain of women is the spiritual. We forget it but too often.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 909">To bear a child and construct his body almost subconsciously is not enough. The work really commences when, by the power of thought and will, we conceive and create a character capable of manifesting an ideal.</p>

<p class="PE">several of these instances myself. Among them, I remember very clearly two little girls; they were twins and perfectly beautiful. But the most astonishing was how little like their parents they were. They reminded me of a very famous picture painted by the English artist Reynolds. One day I made this remark to the mother, who immediately exclaimed: “Indeed, is it not so? You will be interested to know that while I was expecting these children, I had, hanging above my bed, a very good reproduction of Reynolds’ picture. Before going to sleep and as soon as I woke, my last and first glance was for that picture; and in my heart I hoped: may my children be like the faces in this picture. You see that I succeeded quite well!” In truth, she could be proud of her success, and her example is of great utility for other women.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 913">But if we can obtain such results on the physical plane where the materials are the least plastic, how much more so on the psychological plane where the influence of thought and will is so powerful. Why accept the obscure bonds of heredity and atavism — which are nothing else than subconscious preferences for our own trend of character — when we can, by concentration and will, call into being a type constructed according to the highest ideal we are able to conceive? With this effort, maternity becomes truly precious and sacred; indeed with this, we enter the glorious work of the Spirit, and womanhood rises above animality and its ordinary instincts, towards real humanity and its powers.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 914">In this effort, in this attempt, then, lies our true duty. And if this duty was always of the greatest importance, it certainly has taken a capital one in the present turn of the earth’s evolution.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 927">It is to this call of Nature that we must answer, to this</p>
<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-155-1"><sup>1</sup><em>It seems that the following paragraphs from an earlier draft were intended for insertion here</em>:<br/>
      Which is this goal? Toward what unexpected realisation of the future does Nature aim? What does she seek since her dark origins?
Each form that she creates is a fresh affirmation of that which through her will be born, of that which it is her mission to manifest.
Each species preparing the others, making them possible, bears witness to her untiring perseverance, is a proof of her solemn vow; in each one is a little more matter transfigured, announcing future dawns of intelligence. Through innumerable cycles how many paths has she had to follow in order to reach at last the cave of the anthropoid, the primitive man?
It is before him that will open the royal avenue leading to the palace of spirit. But how many races, how many generations will pass on the earth without discovering it, how many wrong paths will Nature follow in the footsteps of man. For, believing himself the masterpiece of the universe, he knows not that he has a further stage to pass through.
Could the idea of man be conceived, before he existed, in the obscure brain of even the nearest of his ancestors? Can the idea of the superman, before he exists, penetrate into the brain of man?
And yet, in every child of man which comes into the world, in every growing intelligence, in every effort of the emerging generations, in every attempt of human genius, Nature seeks the way which, once again, will lead her further.
Fifteen hundred million men since perhaps fifteen hundred centuries wander without finding this way.
Among the multitude of the ways over which all the efforts of their progress are scattered, in this domain as in all the others, only one is good: it is the way of synthetic perfections. Where to discover it?
And who among men dares to venture elsewhere than on the easy and well-beaten tracks? Who, knowing that there is another path which goes further, accepts to lose all in order to find it perhaps, to lose all in walking alone, in thinking alone, always apart among the others, not even certain of attaining what he seeks.
Try not to discover this one among the men who excel and shine, for these excel and shine only in being, somewhat more perfectly, similar to their own kind.
Precious stones also excel and shine among all the other stones, but the most beautiful gem is outside the series of chemical combinations from whence comes forth life. In the same way, ascending the series of forms, the most beautiful tree of the forest is outside the lines of evolution which lead the biological process up to the animal, up to man.
And once again, among men, the most admired, the most famous, the most artistic, the most learned, the most religious, may well find himself far off the way leading from man to superman.
Each race, each civilisation, each human society, each religion, represents a new attempt of Nature, one more effort adding to the long series of those she multiplied during countless time.
Now, as among all the animal forms there was one from which man was to come forth, so also, among the social and religious species, must one be born from which some day will come forth the superman.
For it is this which Nature seeks in all her successive attempts, from the first germination of life until man, until the God who shall be born of him.
In the multitude of men she seeks the possibility of the superman; and in each one of them, she aims towards the realisation of the divine.

<p class="PE">magnificent, to this grandiose work that we must devote ourselves. Let us try to make as clear as we can the steps of our advance on this difficult and as yet unexplored path.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 928">First of all we must be careful, in our attempt to conceive the future man or superman, not to adopt an actual type of man, perfecting or aggrandising him. To avoid as much as possible this mistake we should study the teachings of life’s evolution.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 929">We have already seen that the appearance of a new species always announces the manifestation on earth of a new principle, a new plane of consciousness, a new force or power. But, at the same time, while the new species acquires this formerly unmanifested power or consciousness, it may lose one or many of the</p>
<span id="page_157"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 157</p>
<p class="PE">perfections which were the characteristics of the immediately preceding species. For instance, to speak only of the last step of Nature’s development, what are the greatest differences between man and his immediate predecessor, the ape? In the monkey we see vitality and physical ability reaching the utmost perfection, a perfection that the new species had to abandon. For man, there has been no more of that marvellous climbing up trees, somersaults over abysses, jumps from summit to summit, but in exchange he acquired intelligence, the power of reasoning, combining, constructing. Indeed with man it is the life of mind, of intellect which appeared on earth. Man is essentially a mental being; and if his possibilities do not stop there, if he feels in himself other worlds, other faculties, other planes of consciousness beyond his mental life, they are only as promises for the future, in the same way as the mental possibilities are latent in the monkey.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 930">It is true that some men, very few, have lived in that world beyond, which we may call the spiritual; some have been, indeed, the living incarnations of that world on earth, but they are the exceptions, the forerunners showing the way to the race, leading it towards its future realisation, not the average man. But that which was the privilege of a few beings scattered through time and space, shall become the central characteristic of the new type which is to appear.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 931">At present, man governs his life through reason; all the activities of the mind are of common use for him; his means of knowledge are observation and deduction; it is by and through reasoning that he takes his decision and chooses his way — or believes he does — in life.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 932">The new race shall be governed by intuition, that is to say, direct perception of the divine law within. Some human beings actually know and experience intuition — as, undoubtedly, certain big gorillas of the forests have glimpses of reasoning.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 933">In mankind, the very few who have cultivated their inner</p>
<span id="page_158"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 158</p>
<p class="PE">self, who have concentrated their energies on the discovery of the true law of their being, possess more or less the faculty of intuition. When the mind is perfectly silent, pure like a well-polished mirror, immobile as a pond on a breezeless day, then, from above, as the light of the stars drops in the motionless waters, so the light of the supermind, of the Truth within, shines in the quieted mind and gives birth to intuition. Those who are accustomed to listen to this voice out of the Silence, take it more and more as the instigating motive of their actions; and where others, the average men, wander along the intricate paths of reasoning, they go straight their way, guided through the windings of life by intuition, this superior instinct, as by a strong and unfailing hand.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 934">This faculty which is exceptional, almost abnormal now, will certainly be quite common and natural for the new race, the man of tomorrow. But probably the constant exercise of it will be detrimental to the reasoning faculties. As man possesses no more the extreme physical ability of the monkey, so also will the superman lose the extreme mental ability of man, <a class="fn-ref" data-fn="158-2" href="#">2</a> this ability to deceive himself and others.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 935">Thus, man’s road to supermanhood will be open when he declares boldly that all he has yet developed, including the intellect of which he is so rightly and yet so vainly proud, is now no longer sufficient for him, and that to uncase, discover, set free this greater power within, shall be henceforward his great preoccupation. Then will his philosophy, art, science, ethics, social existence, vital pursuits be no longer an exercise of mind and life for themselves, in a circle, but a means for the discovery of a greater Truth behind mind and life and the bringing of its power into our human existence. And this discovery is that of our real, because our highest self and nature.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 936">However, that self which we are not yet, but have to become, is not the strong vital Will hymned by Nietzsche, but a spiritual self and spiritual nature. For as soon as we speak of supermanhood we must be careful to avoid all confusion with the strong but so superficial and incomplete conception of Nietzsche’s superman.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 937">Indeed, since Nietzsche invented the word superman, when someone uses it to speak of the coming race, willingly or not, it evokes at the same time Nietzsche’s conception. Certainly, his idea that to develop the superman out of our present very unsatisfactory manhood is our real business, is in itself an absolutely sound idea; certainly, his formula of our aim,“to become ourselves”, implying, as it does, that man has not yet found all his true self, his true nature by which he can successfully and spontaneously live, could not be bettered; nevertheless, Nietzsche made the mistake we said we ought to avoid: his superman is but a man aggrandised, magnified, in whom Force has become super-dominant, crushing under its weight all the other attributes of man. Such cannot be our ideal. We see too well at present whither leads the exclusive worshipping of Force — to the crimes of the strong and the ruin of continents.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 938">No, the way to supermanhood lies in the unfolding of the ever-perfect Spirit. All would change, all would become easy if man could once consent to be spiritualised. The higher perfection of the spiritual life will come by a spontaneous obedience of spiritualised man to the truth of his own realised being, when he has become himself, found his own real nature; but this spontaneity will not be instinctive and subconscient as in the animal, but intuitive and fully, integrally conscient.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 939">Therefore, the individuals who will most help the future of humanity in the new age, will be those who will recognise a spiritual evolution as the destiny and therefore the great need of the human being, an evolution or conversion of the present type of humanity into a spiritualised humanity, even as the animal man has been largely converted into a highly mentalised humanity.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 940">They will be comparatively indifferent to particular belief and form of religion, and leave men to resort to the beliefs and forms to which they are naturally drawn. They will only hold as essential the faith in the spiritual conversion. They will especially not make the mistake of thinking that this change can be effected by machinery and outward institutions; they will know and never forget that it has to be lived out by each man inwardly or it can never be made a reality.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 941">And among these individuals, woman must be the first to realise this great change, as it is her special task to give birth in this world to the first specimens of the new race. And to be able to do this she must, more or less, conceive what will be the practical results of this spiritual conversion. For if it cannot be effected simply by exterior transformations, it can neither be realised without bringing forth such transformations.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 942">These will certainly not be less in the moral and social domains than in the intellectual.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 943">As religious beliefs and cults will become secondary, so also the ethical restrictions or prescriptions, rules of conduct or conventions will lose their importance.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="160-3" href="#">3</a></p>

            But among these individuals woman, as we have already said, will have one special task to accomplish, that of giving birth in this world to the first specimens of the new race. And to be able to do this we must, more or less, conceive first in our thought the ideal of what the superman can be.
Of course, nothing is more difficult than to draw a picture of what will be the new race; it is an almost unrealisable attempt, and we shall certainly not try to enter into details; for we cannot ask of our mind to grasp with any certainty or accuracy this creation of the supermind, of the spirit.
But as we have already seen that the replacing of mental reason by intuitive knowledge will be one of the characteristic features of the future being, in the same way, morally and socially what can be the standard of the new race's life?
From the ethical point of view, for the individual of the new race there will certainly be no more restrictions or prescriptions, rules of conduct or conventions.

<p class="PE">and the mental power with its decrees. When the vital will is submitted to the mental power, then the life of the individual or of the society becomes moral. But it is only when both, vital will and mental power, are equally submissive to something higher, to the supermind, that human life is exceeded, that true spiritual life begins, the life of the superman; for his law will come from within, it will be the divine law shining in the centre of each being and governing life from therein, the divine law multiple in its manifestation but one in its origin. And because of its unity this law is the law of supreme order and harmony.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 946">Thus the individual, no more guided by egoistical motives, laws or customs, shall abandon all selfish aims. His rule will be perfect disinterestedness. To act in view of a personal profit, either in this world or in another beyond, will become an unthinkable impossibility. For each act will be done in complete, simple, joyful obedience to the divine law which inspires it, without any seeking for reward or results, as the supreme reward will be in the very delight of acting under such inspiration, of being identified in conscience and will with the divine principle within oneself.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 947">And in this identification the superman will find also his social standard. For in discovering the divine law in himself he will recognise the same divine law in every being, and by being identified with it in himself he will be identified with it in all, thus becoming aware of the unity of all, not only in essence and substance but also in the most exterior planes of life and form. He will not be a mind, a life or a body, but the informing and sustaining Soul or Self, silent, peaceful, eternal, that possesses them; and this Soul or Self he will find everywhere sustaining and informing and possessing all lives and minds and bodies. He will be conscious of this Self as the divine creator and doer of all works, one in all existences; for the many souls of the universal manifestation are only faces of the one Divine. He will perceive each being to be the universal Divinity presenting to him many faces; he will merge himself in That and perceive his own mind,</p>
<span id="page_162"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 162</p>
<p class="PE">life and body as only one presentation of the Self, and all whom we, at present, conceive of as others will be to his consciousness his own self in other minds, lives and bodies. He will be able to feel his body one with all bodies, as he will be aware constantly of the unity of all matter; he will unite himself in mind and heart with all existences; in short, he will see and feel his own person in all others and all others in himself, realising thus true solidarity in the perfection of unity.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 948">But we must limit to these indispensable hints our description of the superman, and push no further our attempt to picture him, as we are convinced that any endeavour to be more precise would prove not only vain but useless. For it is not a number of imaginings, more or less exact, which can help us in the formation of the future type. It is by holding firm in our heart and mind the dynamism, the irresistible impetus given by a sincere and ardent aspiration, by maintaining in ourselves a certain state of enlightened receptivity towards the supreme Idea of the new race which wills to be manifested on earth, that we can take a decisive step in the formation of the sons of the future, and make ourselves fit to serve as intermediaries for the creation of those who shall save Humanity.<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="162-4" href="#">4</a></p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 964">One day a slave carrying a bowl of boiling hot water was passing by Hussein as he dined. By misfortune a little water fell upon the grandson of the Prophet who let out a cry of rage.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1358">In his throne room there were six hundred seats, half of which were occupied by sages, the other half by Jinns or genies who assisted Solomon by their magic power.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1359">Throughout the sittings of the Council, a multitude of great birds would appear at a word from the king and spread their wings to shade the people in the six hundred seats. And at his command, each morning and evening, a powerful wind would arise, lifting up the whole palace and instantaneously transporting it a month’s journey away. In this way, the king was at hand to govern the distant lands that belonged to him.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1360">Besides, Solomon made the most marvellous throne one could ever dream of. And this throne was designed in such a way that no one would dare to utter an untruth in the presence of the king.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1361">It was made of ivory, inlaid with pearls, emeralds and rubies, and around it stood four golden date-palms on which the dates were also emeralds and rubies. At the top of two of these palms were golden peacocks, and on the two others were golden vultures. On each side of the throne there were also two golden lions between two pillars of emerald. And golden vines bearing ruby grapes twined around the trunks of the trees.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1564">A new-born baby lay in a grove. You might think that he was sure to die, for his mother had laid him there and gone away never to return. But it so happened that honey-sweet drops fell from the beautiful flowers of the Illupay tree and nourished the tiny child until a good woman passed on her way to worship great Shiva in the temple near the grove.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1565">At the sight of the infant, her heart was moved with pity; she took him up and carried him to her husband who welcomed him gladly, for he had no son of his own.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1566">The couple adopted the unknown child from the Illupay grove. But very soon the neighbours began to mock them, reproaching them for taking care of a child without caste. So, for fear of displeasing them by looking after the baby themselves, they put him in a hammock hung from the beams of a stable, and entrusted him to an outcaste family.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1567">A few years later the boy, strong in body and bright in mind, said farewell to those who had showed him kindness and set out</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 231</p>
<p class="PE">alone to travel. After walking for some time, he sat down to rest at the foot of a palm-tree. And it happened that the tree took care of him and seemed to love him like the woman who had once taken him up in the Illupay grove. For though it might seem impossible that a tree with such a tall trunk could shelter someone in the shade of its leaves throughout one whole day, the story tells that the shadow did indeed keep still and shield the boy with its coolness for as long as he wished to sleep.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1569">Now why should it have happened like that?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1570">Why was the child saved from his very birth and why did the palm-tree shelter him from the heat of the sun? Because his life was precious: this child was one day to become the noble Tiruvalluvar, the famous Tamil poet and author of the sweet verses of the Kural.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1576">In Kaveripakam there lived a farmer who owned a thousand head of cattle and vast fields of corn. But a demon had been terrifying the countryside; he uprooted the crops from the soil, and slew cattle and men. And the hearts of the people of Kaveripakam were distressed.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1577">“I will give house, land and money to the hero who will rid</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1578">For a long time no hero appeared, and the farmer asked the sages who lived on the mountain what he ought to do.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1579">“Go to Tiruvalluvar,” said the sages of the mountain.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1580">So he went to visit the young poet and asked for his help. Then Tiruvalluvar took some ashes and spread them on the palm of his hand and on it wrote five sacred letters, uttered some mantras, then threw the ashes into the air. And the power of the letters and the mantras fell upon the demon, so that he died. This filled the people of Kaveripakam with joy.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1581">Later, when Tiruvalluvar came to the town of Madura, many people gathered together to hear him recite lines from his beautiful poem, and they were enchanted by the verses composed by the child from the Illupay grove:</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1582" style="text-align:center"><em>Hard it is to find in this world<br/>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1583">But on a bench, beside a pool where lotus flowers floated on the tranquil waters, some very learned poets were sitting in a row.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1584">These men on the bench had no intention of making room for a fellow-poet of low birth, but they tried to confound him with their questions and to catch him out in some mistake. At last they said:</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1586">Tiruvalluvar placed his writings next to them, and the legend says that the bench at once shrank until it was just large enough to hold only the poem. So the proud and jealous poets of Madura tumbled into the water of the pool! Yes, the forty-nine envious men fell into the pool amid the lotuses. They came out dripping and ashamed. And from that day, all who speak the Tamil language have a great love for the Kural.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1919">All the deer, except the two old ones who had stayed in the wood, were now gathered in the park. The King was pleased, and from time to time he shot one of the herd with his bow and arrow. Nandiya’s turn, however, did not come for a very long time.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1920">When at last it did come, Nandiya stood still before the king and did not try to run away.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1921">The King was so struck by this unusual behaviour that he did not shoot. Lowering his bow, he paused.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1922">“Shoot, O King,” said Nandiya.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1923">“I cannot. There is merit in you, O deer. I grant you your life.”</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1928">This deer, the old story says, was the Lord Buddha; he spoke to the King and taught him the Law of Mercy for all living things. And afterwards the King sent a messenger with a drum throughout the country to proclaim his protection for deer, birds and fish.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1929">You will readily agree that Nandiya was right to protect his parents. It would also be good to help a brother or a sister. But you will notice in the next story that a noble Arab spoke of a man as his brother, even though he was not really his brother.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1932">For measuring they used a cup with a stone in it. They poured the water from a water-skin until it covered the stone. This was the share of each one.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1933">Only the chief men in the caravan had a share of water.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1934">The first time that the water was measured out like this, Kab-ibn-Mamah was about to take the cup when he saw a man of the Namir tribe looking at him longingly. Kab said to the man who was giving out the water, “Give my share to this brother,” and pointed to the man of Namir.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1935">The man drank eagerly. Kab had no water.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1936">The next day, the time came again to share the water. Once more the man of Namir looked on with longing. Once more Kab gave the cup to the “brother” as he called him.</p>

<p class="pg-num">Page 271</p>
<p class="PE">delighted and for some time he held the poet in great favour. The poem Shah-Namah was the work of thirty years, and the Sultan had promised to give the poet 60,000 pieces of gold on its completion.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1943">Firdausi was disliked by the Sultan’s Vizier. This man persuaded his master that the treasury was depleted and that it would be only sensible to give the poet silver instead of gold. Mahmud heeded this advice and sent Firdausi some bags containing 60,000 pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1944">Firdausi was at the bath when the bags arrived. He was so infuriated by the Sultan’s avarice that he would not even take the gift. He gave 20,000 pieces to the messenger who had brought the money, 20,000 to the proprietor of the baths, and 20,000 to a beer-seller who happened to be there.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1945">Mahmud was informed of this insult and ordered the poet to be trampled to death by elephants. Firdausi was warned and fled to a distant city; at last he settled at Tus, his birth-place.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1946">Soon the Sultan felt sorry that he had treated Firdausi so shamefully and wished to regain the poet’s respect. He sent a messenger to Tus, bearing him many presents: 60,000 pieces of gold, silks, brocades, velvets....</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1947">Alas! The presents arrived too late.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1957">A number of Hindus formed the Dev Samaj Association in order to do good works. In their monthly journal, things like these were reported:</p>

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1962">You will notice that in some of these cases kindness took the form of teaching. The heart of a teacher is moved by ignorance: another being needs knowledge and he is ready to give it.

When he set out to hunt animals in the jungle, he took one of his brothers with him as a companion. When he rested and ate, his younger brother sat at his side and shared the meal. When the hero went to the house of his Guru to study, he learnt the four Vedas as others might learn a game or a song. Having filled his mind with the Vedas and the Puranas, he had no wish to keep the sacred words in the secrecy of his heart. He taught them to his brother.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 1965">Just as kindness loves to share good knowledge, it also loves to share good news. For example, how great was Hanuman’s joy when he could give joy to others. Listen:</p>

Rama, the all-beautiful, wandered in the forest and knew the perils of war. But Bharata did not know his brother’s fate.

<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2005">This volume contains all the writings of the Mother from the period before 1920, the year she settled in Pondicherry, with the exception of <em>Prayers and Meditations</em>. The book is divided into seven parts, according to the nature and date of the material. Most of the pieces were written originally in French and appear here in English translation. The texts of this (second) edition are the same as those of the first edition, which was published in 1978 as Volume 2 of the Collected Works of the Mother (Centenary Edition). Details about the texts and their publication follow.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2006">
<b>Part 1.</b> The essays and stories in this part were written by the Mother between 1893 and 1912. All the texts were written in French. All but two were first published in 1946 in the first part of a book entitled <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>. This book was reprinted in 1955. An English translation, entitled <em>Words of Long Ago</em>, was published in 1946 and reprinted in 1952 and 1974. In the 1978 edition of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>, the contents of Part 1 of the previous editions were rearranged according to date and two new pieces added: "A Sapphire Tale" and an unpublished note related to "On Thought". "A Sapphire Tale" was first published in the original French and in English translation in the monthly journal <em>Mother India</em> in February 1957. At the time of its publication the Mother remarked to the journal’s editor that the story expressed "the ideal of the overmind creation". The original translations of all the contents of Part 1 were revised for publication in 1978 in <em>Words of Long Ago</em>, Volume 2 of the Collected Works of the Mother. The same contents were brought out in the original French in 1983 in <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>, the French counterpart of Volume 2 of the Collected Works.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2007"><b>Part 2.</b> The essays in this part were written by the Mother for the meetings of “a small group of seekers” in 1912. All the texts were written in French. All but one were published in 1946 in the second part</p>

<p class="PE">of <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>. This book was reprinted in 1955. An English translation, entitled <em>Words of Long Ago</em>, was brought out in 1946 and reprinted in 1952 and 1974. In the 1978 edition of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>, one new piece was added: the essay for the meeting of 7 May 1914. This essay, which was restored to its original position in the series, was first published in 1939 in <em>Quelques paroles, quelques prières</em> and in English translation as the Foreword to the 1940 edition of Words of the Mother. The question at the beginning of this essay, taken from the Mother’s handwritten manuscript, was published for the first time in the 1978 edition of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>. The original translations of all the contents of Part 2 were revised for publication in that edition. The same contents were brought out in the original French in 1983 in <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2008"><b>Part 3.</b> Between 1911 and 1913 the Mother gave a number of talks to different groups in Paris. Two of these talks, "On Thought" and "On Dreams", appear in Part 1 of this book. Several other talks never published in the Mother’s lifetime are published here as Part 3. The Mother sometimes presented the same talk to different groups, with suitable additions and alterations. These variants, if significant and non-repetitive, have been given here in footnotes. A note relating to the Mother’s talks, which was found among her manuscripts, has been placed before the other items. The talks, notes and reflections in this part, all from the period 1912-13, were first published in English translation in 1978 as Part 3 of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>. The original French texts were first brought out in 1983 as Part 3 of <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2009"><b>Part 4.</b> The writings in this part, similar to <em>Prayers and Meditations</em>, were not published in the Mother’s lifetime. Several of the pieces are dated between 1914 and 1916; the remainder seem clearly to belong to the period before 1920. These writings first appeared in English translation in 1978 as Part 4 of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>.

Several of the pieces are dated between 1914 and 1915; the rest appear to have been written around the same time. None of the writings were published during the Mother’s lifetime. They first appeared in English translation in 1978 as Part 5 of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>. The original French texts were first brought out in 1983 as Part 5 of <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="Words of Long Ago - 2011"><b>Part 6.</b> The letters, essays, etc. comprising this part were written in Japan between 1916 and 1920. "Woman and the War", written originally in French, was published in an English translation seen and revised by the Mother, in the <em>Fujoshimbun</em> on 7 July 1916. "Woman and Man", written in French around the same time and translated into English by the Mother, was never published in either language during her lifetime. "Reminiscences" also appears to have been written first in French and translated subsequently into English, very likely by the Mother herself. The other pieces in this part appear to have been written originally in English. They are among the Mother’s first compositions in the English language. "Impressions of Japan", dated 9 July 1915, was written in Akakura and published in the form reproduced here in the <em>Modern Review</em> (Calcutta) in January 1918. "The Children of Japan", an incomplete letter, was written shortly after "Impressions of Japan". "Myself and My Creed" was written in February 1920. "To the Women of Japan" is undated. It exists in several versions, one of which has been chosen as the principal text; to this, passages from other versions have been added. Part of this talk was published as "To the Women of the World" in the annual <em>Sri Aurobindo Circle</em> of 1947. Some revisions, made by the Mother for this publication, have been included in the present text. A greater portion of the talk was published as "Talk to the Women of Japan" in 1967. The last part of "To the Women of Japan" incorporated passages from Sri Aurobindo’s <em>Human Cycle</em>, <em>Synthesis of Yoga</em>, etc. The pieces in this part were published together in English in 1978 as Part 6 of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>. The same pieces were brought out in French in 1983 as Part 6 of <em>Paroles d’autrefois</em>.</p>

Gould which had been published in his <em>Youth's Noble Path</em> in 1911. The Mother's versions, written in French, were first published under the title <em>Belles Histoires</em> in 1946. English translations of the stories were first brought out in 1951 under the title <em>Tales of All Times</em>. These translations were revised for inclusion in Part 7 of the 1978 edition of <em>Words of Long Ago</em>. Several hitherto unpublished stories were translated and added as an appendix to that volume. All the stories were published in the original French in 1983 in Part 7 of <em>Paroles d'autrefois</em> and its appendix.</p>
