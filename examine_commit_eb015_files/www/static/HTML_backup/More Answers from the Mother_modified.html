<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 11"><em>To a young disciple who joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in 1930 at the age of thirteen. After eight years of study he took up work, first on he construction of Golconde (an Ashram residential quarters) as a carpentry supervisor and then in the Granary and Dining Room. In 1945 he became a teacher in the newly-opened Ashram school and presently works in the Reception Service. The disciple started writing to the Mother at the age of fifteen.</em></p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>When I sleep at noon I am not conscious; if there is any noise I don't hear it. But at night when I sleep, I am sometimes conscious and can hear nearly everything.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 12">No, it is not all right not to sleep. It is necessary to sleep very quietly and well. Besides, this does not prevent you, when you dream, from being conscious of your dreams. What is it that prevents you from sleeping?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 13">You must tell me everything very sincerely and without fear. Telling me everything very frankly brings you closer to me.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I want to know the significance of the elephant whose picture you sent me today, and also of the parrot.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What is the significance of the picture of the rabbit you sent me today?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 22">It is not a rabbit, it is a <em>hare</em> and the hare means "prudence".</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">6 January 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Now I understand everything. I will never make the same mistake again. I am very sad about this. Now I will be calm and try not to do anything you do not like.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 23">That is good, my child; I trust you and I know that you will never deliberately do anything I do not like. So you must not be sad nor dwell on the past, but think only of the joy of not making any more mistakes on this point in the future.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 24">And you may be sure that my affection will always be with you to help you to do the right thing.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I think that what I wrote yesterday was not good. Now I regret what I wrote.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 25">You must not regret. It is always better to be frank and open; that is the best way to correct one’s mistakes.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">24 January 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>X tells me that she won't make any shirts for me, only Punjabis. Then, after a lot of quarrelling, she tells me</em></p></blockquote>
<span id="page_5"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 5</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">that she will make one punjabi and one shirt, but I want two coloured shirts.</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 26">You were quite wrong to quarrel. I completely disapprove of this behaviour. You are still a child and ought to respect your elders. Besides, it is the worst possible way to get something from someone.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 27">You say, "I <em>want</em> shirts"; that is not the way to speak. By what right does a desire or preference dare to impose itself in this way?</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 28">After enquiring I shall tell you what can be done.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">5 February 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I didn't quarrel with X. I didn't answer her questions and I don't know enough French to quarrel with her.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 29">If you didn't quarrel, it is all right. <em>To quarrel</em> means to say unpleasant things to each other with violence.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I shall oppose the vital, I shall fight with it, I shall win the victory. One day I shall win the victory over all the dark forces. The Divine Grace is there—why should I fear?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 35">Yes, you should not fear, you should keep an entire faith in the Divine Grace. The second point is to keep your body well-balanced by getting enough sleep — seven hours out of twenty-four — and enough food.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">2 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Yesterday at noon I was reading a book and after a while I fell asleep. I awoke with a start and looked at the time: it was almost one o'clock. I had a class at one o'clock. So I was able to go. Was it the Divine who woke me up?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 36">Not necessarily. One part of the subconscient is always alert, and having the will to wake up at a certain time is enough for that part to wake you.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">3 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>How can one change the obscure vital into a luminous vital?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 37">By the surrender of the vital, its opening to the light, and the growth of consciousness.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">4 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Last night, I got the idea that I would try to observe absolute silence, not even laughing or thinking. Thinking only of the Mother. Praying to the Divine.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 38">Not laughing or thinking, that is going a bit too far!</p>
<span id="page_7"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 7</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I said to myself: But why not observe silence all day? I shall try to do so.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 39">That is a bit too much. Control over one’s speech is more important than complete silence. The best thing is to learn to say only what is useful in the most accurate and truthful way possible.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">5 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Sometimes I become absolutely calm. I speak to nobody. I walk about alone, thinking of the Divine. If someone talks to me and sometimes speaks unnecessarily, I don't answer him. Is it all right to keep this condition all the time?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 40">It is an excellent condition which can be maintained without any harm, but it must be sincere. That is, it must not be an appearance of calm, but a true and deep calm which spontaneously keeps you silent.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">9 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q">(<em>About a picture on an envelope</em>) <em>Is it a goat?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 41">It is an antelope, with the significance “swiftness of movement”. The goat is “agility”.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">9 March 1933<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="7-2" href="#">2</a></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 42">(<em>About a picture of some pigs</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 43">The envelope I am sending you represents the obscure movements of the vital in the nature.</p>

<div class="fns">
<p class="footnote" id="fn-7-2"><sup>2</sup> This date is the same as the one above it because the disciple sometimes corresponded more than once a day.</p>

<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 44">After Truth comes Truth and again Truth!</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">23 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>At night I sleep well only after 11:00. I get up at 5:30, but I wake up at 4:00 or 4:30.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 45">It is not good to lie in bed when you are awake; it is more tiring than restful and it also increases tamas. It is better to jump out of bed as soon as you wake up; then in the evening you will feel sleepy and can get to sleep earlier. The hours of sleep <em>before midnight</em> are the best and most restful.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">25 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>In the story of Prahlad the child was about to die, but he thought only of the Divine who in his consciousness replaced the fire that was to burn him. Death was changed into life, into joy, and through that he realised the Divine Light. Does this story mean that through the Divine or the divine help, difficult things can be changed into easy things, even death into life?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 46">Yes, it is morally true and one day it will also be physically true.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">26 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I want to ask you two other things I remember now. Write for me: "Do not read stories to console the vital." And the second: "Do not speak unnecessarily to satisfy or please the vital."</em></p></blockquote>
<span id="page_9"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 9</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 47">Do not waste time reading frivolous and unwholesome things. Do not waste your energy in idle small talk.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">28 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q">What does “compassion” mean?</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 48">Compassion is the equivalent of <em>miséricorde.</em> It is a pity full of strength and kindness, a pity that pardons and makes amends, forgets all offences and wants always what is best for everyone.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">31 March 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I am observing myself and I find no special movement or any doubt and what is more I feel happy. But sometimes it happens that the observation is not quite true.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 49">One needs to have reached a pinnacle of wisdom before one can hope never to be mistaken. All of you have much to do before that.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">3 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>Y is a good boy—there are some fine qualities in his character. But one bad thing I find in him is vanity.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 50">He is very young — he will grow out of it. Have you no vanity at all in you that you can reproach others with it?</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">3 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>(After describing a dream the disciple commented:) I have not written just exactly how I saw things in the dream because it is difficult to describe.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 51">I advise you to be very attentive and scrupulous about saying</p>
<span id="page_10"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 10</p>
<p class="PE">only what is perfectly accurate. It is very easy to make things up when one is telling a dream and then it no longer has any value.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">10 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>What is the significance of this picture showing a young girl with her hand on a lion's back? "With the help of the divine power all the hostile forces can become calm and peaceful"—is that it?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 52">The lion is the symbol of power. It would be better to say that under the control of the Divine Will, power is beneficent, while without that control it harms everyone and becomes terrible.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">10 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 53">(<em>About a picture of some hunters which the disciple sent to the Mother</em>)</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 54">What an ugly picture you have sent me! The men are sinister brutes, the cruellest of all living creatures.</p>

<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>The Divine is the true supreme goal of our life. We must fulfil the divine will. But who is the Divine, and what is the divine will?</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 55">These are things one cannot speak about; they have to be discovered through personal experience.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">13 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I have faith in my strength and believe I am capable of doing all the work.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 56">It is not in <em>your</em> own strength that you should have faith. It is in</p>
<span id="page_11"></span>
<p class="pg-num">Page 11</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 57"> <em>the</em> divine force, which works in all who are consecrated to the Divine and sustains them in their action.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>I have faith that I am capable of doing all the work. I like the work a lot; so if you don't mind, I would like to continue.</em></p></blockquote>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 58">I repeat: having faith in <em>yourself</em> cannot take you very far and it is certain that sooner or later you will feel a reaction and be obliged to stop.</p>
<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 59">First establish the true attitude, which is to find your base, your support and your help in <em>the Divine alone</em>—then all possibility of fatigue will disappear. Until then it is better to let the servant do at least part of the work, which you can supervise if you like.</p>
<blockquote><p class="Q">17 April 1933</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p class="Q"><em>After finishing the meter-reading work,<a class="fn-ref" data-fn="11-3" href="#">3</a> I felt very tired. It seemed to me that something wanted to prevent me from doing any more work, so I pulled myself up and said to myself, "No, no, you must work. Have faith, everything will go away." And indeed, the tiredness disappeared. In the evening I had a very bad stomach-ache. I thought that it too wanted to prevent me from working. But I told myself, "No, you must work. It is only through work or through faith that the pain will go away. If you rest, it will get worse." As I expected, the pain went away after my supper.

<p class="P" search_id="More Answers from the Mother - 71">It is taught in advanced grammar courses, and there are also special books. One of the principal rules of style is that in a prose passage one should not use "I" except when it is absolutely impossible to avoid it, and in any case <em>one should never begin two consecutive sentences</em> with "I".

Raised in Gurukul Kangri in Uttar Pradesh, the disciple joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in July 1938, at the age of twenty-one, and has remained ever since. He sought to serve the Mother especially through his work, and this concern is reflected in his letters, most of which deal directly with problems of work. During his fifty years in the Ashram, the disciple has served in many positions. The main ones, mentioned here because they are referred to in the correspondence, are: the preparation of fruit juices for Sri Aurobindo and the Mother; the allotment of work to new Ashramites; the distribution of fuel and foodstuffs to Ashramites; the management (in conjunction with others in some cases) of the Fruit Room, Dining Room, Bakery and Laundry; editor of</em> Purodha <em>and</em> Agnishikha, <em>two monthly journals in Hindi; Hindi teacher at the Ashram's Centre of Education; and the Hindi translator of many works of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother.</em></p>

He claimed to be a poor man, though he is building a four-storey house for himself and earns about Rs. 1200 to 1600 per month. He wanted to have your "special darshan" and you refused—it was so unkind. The poor man then made up his mind that if you change your mind and see him, he will give you Rs. 10 and his wife will give Rs. 15—and still you did not meet him. It was impossible for him to give Rs. 100, as suggested by a friend, for the simple reason that he did not have that much. When he went back, broken-hearted, he was caught by the crowd of students in Andhra. He had to beg and plead for mercy and by divine grace he could at once offer Rs. 500 to get out of their hands!!</em></p></blockquote>

During a nap of ten minutes in the afternoon she came out of the body, but could not re-enter it. She called the Mother. An enveloping Force of strength and a tickling sensation was felt from her feet to her head and she could re-enter the body. Afterwards there was much tiredness. That night her sleep was disturbed, there was pain in her body and her face had the pallor of death.</em></p></blockquote>

She thought that death had come and she could never re-enter her body. She got flurried, but some-how composed herself and hovered round and round the body. She flew up and caught sight of the colour picture of the Mother's Feet hanging on the wall near the ceiling. She went near it and prayed fervently to those Feet. Then she was able to effect an entry into her body through the head, but with great suffering and pain. Her whole body was dead cold and frigid, and it took some time for her to become normal.</em></p></blockquote>

Of the six correspondences in this volume, four were first published in whole or in part in the <em>Bulletin of Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education</em>, a bi-lingual quarterly in French and English; the remaining two were first brought out in 1990 in the first edition of this volume. Two of these correspondences were written in English; four were written wholly or partly in French. The original translations of the material in French were revised for publication in 1990. This second edition (2003) contains the same texts as the first edition. The correspondences were first published together in French in 1997 under the title <em>Quelques réponses de la Mère - 2</em>.</p>
